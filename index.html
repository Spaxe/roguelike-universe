      <h2>Explore the Influence Arcs</h2>
      <p>This diagram aligns each roguelike game by their release year, and draw influence arcs between the years. <span style="border-bottom: 3px solid rgb(79,74,138)">Thicker arcs</span> depict documented and known influences. <span style="border-bottom: 0.5px solid rgb(79,74,138)">Thinner arcs</span> are inferred influences gathered from web scraping, such as how often two games appear together in the same article.</p>
      <div class="flex">
        <div>
          <p class="mt0">Arcs above the horizon are influences between two roguelike games, and arcs below the horizon are influences between a roguelike and a non-roguelike game.</p>

      <h3>The Genre-Influence Matrix</h3>
      <div class="flex">
        <div>
          <p>The genre-influence matrix divides the diagram above into 4 quadrants. Each quadrant represents a pair made of <em>in-genre</em>/<em>out-of-genre</em> and <em>past</em>/<em>future</em>. This creates an interesting dynamic where a title can be representative of its own genre, taking most of its influence from the past, or influential by having many connections to its future, with respect to roguelike titles.</p>
          <p>For instance, <span id="genre-influential-text"></span> Recently published games may be representative of its genre now, but as time goes on, it may become more influential in the genre as other games follow its footsteps.</p>
          <p>If we aggregate the number of influences for each game, we can plot them in a 2-dimensional map.</p>

      <h2>Laying out the Roguelike Influence Map</h2>
      <p>Similar to the diagram above, this map divides games into 4 quadrants. The position is calculated by adding up the number of influences in each quadrant. The further they are away from the origin, the more distinct their influences are. For instance, influences mostly in roguelike games will result in above the horizon line.</p>
      <p>Click on a circle to see which games are at that location.</p>

      <h2>Roguelike (and Roguelike-like) Influence Timeline</h2>
      <p>Lastly, we produce a scatter plot of every roguelike, and 'roguelike-like' games. The horizontal axis is the release year (or the exact date as available), and the vertical, stacked axis is the number of influences each game has on other games. Games with no influences are omitted. Influences are drawn as links between the dots.</p>
      <div class="flex">
        <div>
          <p class="mt0">The primary aim of this chart is to not only show one 'hop' of influences, but also show multiple hops, influences of influences. Influences may form a small-world network.</p>

    <h2>About this page</h2>
    <p><em>Roguelike Universe</em> is an ongoing project to visualise roguelike influences. This project is <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvx2Ajw_34mPcHeA5bXF2JsPPAPSrvg1JxP1Fzo8IxbG4U4w/viewform" target="_blank">seeking corrections, suggestions, and feedback</a>.</p>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p>Known influence was collected through <a href="https://forums.roguetemple.com/irldb/" target="_blank">RogueTemple's IRLDB</a>, with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cUmwMHQQWkPTh-89L9QDVc25QOCAHqjvqZYOufzmQOk/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">hand-cleaned version</a> stored online. You are welcome to edit the data. The search setting used can be found in <a href="assets/search_settings.png" target="_blank">this picture</a>. Inferred influence was calculated by <a href="https://github.com/Spaxe/roguelike-universe/blob/master/data/Roguelike%20Universe%20-%20Web%20Scraping.ipynb" target="_blank">web scraping</a>, gathering the first 10-30 links found via the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine. Data was <a href="https://github.com/Spaxe/roguelike-universe/blob/master/data/Roguelike%20Universe%20-%20Link%20Generation.ipynb" target="_blank">prepared in Python</a>, with a little bit of post-processing in JavaScript in the browser. Figures are homemade and crafted in <a href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> with care. We try to make the live computed dataset available, which can be downloaded below each figure.</p>
