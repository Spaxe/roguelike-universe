## Developer setup
For Mac OS X and Linux:

 1. Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) in your development machine.
 2. Update `npm`: `npm install -g npm`. This [guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) is your friend.
 3. Install task runner by `npm install -g bash-task-runner`.
 4. (Mac OS X only): Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) following the guide on the site.
 5. Make sure you have `bash>=4`, `coreutils>=8.2`, and `autossh>=1.4`.
    * Homebrew: `brew install bash coreutils autossh`
 6. Test the task runner by running `runner test`.
 7. Set up SSH access to the database machine. For now you have to ask me.
 8. Start SSL tunneling in your development machine so you can access the database:
    `runner start_tunnel`
    * Now you should be able to access to database admin panel at [http://localhost:8004](http://localhost:8004).
 9. Start local server in your development machine:
    `runner server`
    * Your server is live at [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002), useful if you need to test its REST API.
 0. Start local client in your development machine:
    `runner client`
    * You should be able to see a local version of the site at [http://localhost:8003](http://localhost:8003). Enjoy.
