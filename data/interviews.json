      "The man himself", 
      "With 14 days to go Obsidian has twice what their goal was", 
      "From Joystiq", 
      "A few games made with Unity 3D", 
      "Chris Avellone", 
      "A sampling of game projects on Kickstarter", 
      "Loot? Yes. Stats? Yes. RPG? Not so much.", 
      "Action, action, and saving the world with some more action", 
      "Peter promising something", 
      "Gambitious.  An alternative to Kickstarter, for only games, and only Europeans at the moment.", 
      "You can use basic HTML in your post. Gather Your Party will never share your email address with anyone, ever.", 
      "Well, that was an excellant interview! Thanks!", 
      "While the interview is very informal, it still was pretty great. Sawyer’s mentality for RPGs (freedom of choice, actual character role playing, etc) is not only the reason why I loved New Vegas so much, but also seems like that mentality is throughout Obsidian.", 
      "I’m hoping that project eternity turns out well in the end.", 
      "Fucking stellar interview, Del.", 
      "Brilliant interview! i hope they dont drop the companions too far for the next game i actually really liked them in all the obsidian games i played they are usually superbly written. Looking forward to another fantastic rpg by obsidian its been a while", 
      "Long read but well worth it. Very informative and interesting. Thanks!", 
      "When you guys started talking about companions and how you don’t really attach to them if they’re “forced” onto you, I kinda suddenly reminisced glumly about Agro. Sure he was forced on you, I mean, you really can’t get anywhere without him. But that last moment with him was just…", 
      "Have you played SotC? Did you like or dislike Agro? Were you sad when he was gone?", 
      "I know I was, but maybe that’s just me. But if it’s not, then I guess the phrase “there are always exceptions to a rule” still holds true.", 
      "That’s exactly what I was thinking while reading that part. I think that’s different, though. He isn’t exactly forced on you, he’s part of your character.", 
      "It’s also like what they said about Aerith’s death. You didn’t have a choice about her, but the game was more cinematic, so they used cinematic devices to play with your emotions and elicit that response. Also, there weren’t any other friendly characters in the game besides him, so I think that’s part of it as well.", 
      "The same thought went through my head, as well. I was extremely attached to Agro and so were many of my friends. I never played Fable, but I imagine it’s a pretty standard kind of RPG where there’s plenty of townspeople and NPCs.", 
      "SotC, on the other hand, was so completely isolated. Agro was the only friend you had. Thinking about it now, it could have really backfired, the way the dog did!", 
      "I have a lot to say about Agro, haha. Almost everything about him was just so well-executed. Even the way you interact with him—the only experience before SotC I’d ever had with a horse in a game was Epona. When you’re riding Epona, you have complete control over Epona herself, and it’s not like that with Agro. You’re still Wander, and you’re directing Agro with the reins, and he actually responds incredibly well once you realize that. Little things like that really made him his own character, I think.", 
      "Great interview! I actually liked that it was informal, gave it a very conversational tone, as if we were sitting on a couch with you two. I’ll also echo everyone else in saying that your transition to companions in games and being able to organically develop a relationship with them was excellent.", 
      "woah, i had to read this in two parts, but i must say it was well worth it. THIS IS GAMING JOURNALISM. Corny, I know, but It’s how I would really imagine a conversation, not watered down like every other interview out there.", 
      "Thank you!  It’s so nice to see all the kind feedback I’ve gotten for this interview.  Goes to show that my off-the-cuff style seems to be far more appreciated than some calculated series of questions.", 
      "Interviewing Sawyer without having played Fallout? You owe it to yourself to play it. It’s a far better game than any of the other ones you spoke of. Assassin’s Creed? Game was half-baked in the first one and Ubisoft has only gone further in the wrong direction with each successive attempt to refine it."

      "On Wasteland 2, Planescape, South Park and Project Eternity", 
      "Chris Avellone is a resource very much in demand. Working not only on the 'day job' for Obsidian which entails Project Eternity and South Park: The Stick of Truth, Avellone has also become involved in two projects which have a lot of resonance for him. Joining his old comrade Brian Fargo to work on Wasteland was a 'no-brainer', but he's since been commandeered to work on Torment: Tides of Numenera, after becoming his a human stretch goal for the project.", 
      "You suspect that wasn't too difficult a choice to make either, speaking to him. Having been the creator of Planescape: Torment, he's obviously close to the project in spirit, but he's also relishing the chance to be back at the coalface for the semi-sequel. Read on for a chat with Chris about his current workload and an update on the projects he's involved in.", 
      "I think Brian and the crew are really comfortable with Patrick and Nathan and everybody else so now that they've all been working together for a while and Brian really likes the tone of that guys writing and they're good writers. I think it's just a matter of like 'we'll just keep these guys working in the studio and they'll be good for Torment' - so I think it's going to work out pretty well.", 
      "So I'm going to review the design documentation, offer feedback on that, and also they have me writing the eighth companion for the game; that's currently the sum total of my duties.", 
      "One of the designers was talking about one of the areas for Torment and it's basically this big living dungeon that communities live in, and also monsters, and depending on what you feed the dungeon it opens up new portals to other dimensions and it moves around. If anyone attempts to ever quantify the dungeon, and say 'I'm going to try and measure how big it is' or what intelligence level it is they're mysteriously destroyed. And I'm like: this is the craziest and most awesome fucking dungeon ever, but that's not something we would do for Eternity. Eternity would be much more like: here's the architecture for a dungeon that was exploring soul mechanics. So I think the two aesthetics between them sort of help.", 
      "It's also good from the writer's block standpoint where I can go: this idea will work really well in Torment so I can really roll with that, but when I get writer's block there then I can switch over to Eternity and do something else. It actually works out pretty well.", 
      "In terms of alienating their... so therefore my question with Kickstarter is I don't think most people outside the gaming arena actually get as involved with Kickstarter as a result, it's more like a subset of really dedicated gamers that already know who those personalities are or know what that type of game is or know why that game concept is interesting or they know why those people left that studio or what their personal story is. And I think that all factors in.", 
      "But in terms of whether figures like that can alienate or sort of upset the rest of the team...I suppose that's always a danger. I think that the thing to do is, I think personalities like that have a responsibility to call out specific people who have done great work on those titles. Just because obviously those personalities certainly have not come up with all of the systems, or even a good percentage of the systems for those games even though they might be the mouthpiece for the game. So I think that's a real danger and I think that in their role they have a responsibility of making sure that the people that contributed the work that is making everybody successful is being called out specifically and I guess that's my thought.", 
      "And then obviously games like Mass Effect, all the Bioware games, like they have proven what a strong storyline means for keeping your player base. And every convention I go to seeing like the people dressed up at those characters or going up to someone and saying I've formed an attachment to this person you wrote/developed/voice acted, I think that sends a pretty clear signal about how important narrative and getting immersed in the story is.", 
      "The other part of the answer is if I understand correctly I think the narrative track from Austin GDC got moved to this convention when they actually cancelled Austin GDC and now all those narrative tracks take place here now so that could account for some of the presentations but I don't think it would account for all of them.", 
      "The care that people are taking with stories is just getting even better like... So Ken Levine was very nice, so I got a chance to play BioShock Infinite and some of the biggest punches in that entire game, and I only played it for like 5 hours or so, but the biggest punches that occurred for me were all narrative set-up. Like there were some decisions that just surprised the shit out of me, and then horrified me, and I'm like wow, none of this involves shooting mechanics or character stat development, it's all in the presentation of the story and it just amazed me, it was really well done.", 
      "That can be a powerful community tool, but then that got followed by the pragmatic view that as a studio we would have to not only worry about the core game, but then we'll have to expand the staff to make sure that we have the web coverage and the programming and personnel support to make sure that all those share features work properly. Which shouldn't be a big deal, but it just means the team size will get larger as a result, there's more baggage.", 
      "But overall I think it's something players are really going to love because they've been trying to do it so much anyway, but now there's a much easier way, and I'm like oh that's smart.", 
      "And then again, seeing videos of someone putting a bucket over a guard's head and doing all the pickpocketing is actually really entertaining and it makes me want to try that in Skyrim and have even more fun, so I don't care, that's great.", 
      "Torment: Tides of Numenera.", 
      "\"Numenera is much more free flowing, much more story focused, and Eternity is stuff like dungeon exploration, party team, how do you approach a problem, how do you approach an encounter\"", 
      "Project Eternity.", 
      "\"I don't think most people outside the gaming arena actually get as involved with Kickstarter, it's more like a subset of really dedicated gamers that already know who those personalities area\"", 
      "\"Games like Mass Effect, all the Bioware games, like they have proven what a strong storyline means for keeping your player base\"",

      "And there was much rejoicing.", 
      "Read on for details of its new setting, the people involved, whether it’ll link to the original game, which thematic aspects will recur, how the combat may work and how they’ll get it made.", 
      "Fargo: The wheels for the Torment game have been in motion for quite some time. The more we explored the Numenera setting, the clearer it became that it’s a natural fit for a Torment game. And it isn’t too surprising that Numenera’s aesthetics work well for Torment given that Monte was a key designer for the Planescape setting.", 
      "Numenera is very exotic and rich, but is a flexible universe that empowers and support GMs. As Torment desires certain locations or features, we’ll be able to do what we need to while fully respecting the setting. This goes beyond a typical licensing arrangement as Monte will be giving us direct input and even provide writing for some of the game areas. I’m really pleased to have Monte be part of the team.", 
      "RPS – What are the stand-out aspects of Numenera for you, in terms of suiting your dev plans? How much is about the setting and how much the roleplaying mechanics?", 
      "Fargo: We know it hasn’t been done often in the game industry, but we’re envisioning Torment as a thematic franchise with certain themes that can expand over different settings and stories. We will focus on the same things that made people appreciate PST so much: overturning RPG tropes; a fantastic, unconventional setting; memorable companions; deep thematic exploration of the human condition; heavy reactivity (i.e., choice and consequences); an intensely personal (rather than epic) story.", 
      "Fargo: Rather than overt links, we are trying to recapture the feeling that players experienced through PST –both while playing it and after having completed a playthrough. We will remain true to the essence of PST, but we’ll also be looking for ways to improve the areas in which PST could have been even better. Fortunately, besides our personal experiences, we have years of feedback from other passionate PST fans to draw upon. We certainly would not infringe on any copyrights but with that said there are very few elements in RPGs that can be protected. There are several games with talking skull heads, for example, if we wanted to incorporate things of that nature.", 
      "Fargo: We’re very early in Torment’s preproduction right now. We have a basic story outline, design sketches of the major characters, and thematic concepts defined. Wasteland 2 is in full production and we don’t want to detract from that focus. But with that said, the writers on Wasteland are complete for the most part and the concept artists are not involved at this stage in the game. The guys working on Torment are no longer working on Wasteland 2 and I want to keep these talented guys busy for us.  Typically we do begin design of the next game while the production team is working on the current one. This allows the team to take a nice break once they are complete on the current game and then come back to roll onto a design that is thorough and polished. The last thing we want to do is break up a winning team.", 
      "I find this model creates a better quality flow of product and doesn’t have the team jumping onto a sequel before there has been adequate time to absorb the feedback from the game that just shipped. It is a luxury that most mid size developers are not able to have and it allows the time required to create classics. I never like sequels to be rushed and working this way ensures the team works on fresh ideas.", 
      "Fargo: Chris deserves all the credit that he receives and we are working with him on Wasteland 2 as you know. My role as executive producer is to assemble top notch teams and to make sure we stay on point for what we are creating. I’m really happy with the team we have assembled for this game. It was Chris who urged me to work with both Colin McComb and Kevin Saunders for this project and he has given us his blessing for another Torment. Colin McComb and Monte Cook were two of the primary developers of the Planescape campaign setting for TSR, and Colin was one of the main designers on the original Torment. Colin serves as creative lead for this Torment and will be driving the story vision for the game.", 
      "Kevin Saunders, the project director, worked with Chris at Obsidian for 5 years – including leading the Mask of the Betrayer (MotB) team.  People might remember that MotB was very well received and there were more than a few comparisons to PST. Kevin was also the lead designer and producer for Shattered Galaxy, which swept the 2001 Independent Games Festival and was acknowledged by GameSpot as the Most Innovative Game of the year.", 
      "Additionally, we have one of the unsung heroes of PST on the design team: scripter Adam Heine, who really helped breathe life into the game. He was also one of the designers on Black Isle’s TORN, having moved to that position in large part because of his excellent work on PST.", 
      "Our talented artists include Dana Knutson, the concept artist from the original Planescape campaign setting, and he’s been helping bring our ideas to life.", 
      "And to really show we are serious about the writing aspects of this game we brought Ray Vallese in as the editor to ensure the detail and consistency of the story. Ray too was part of the Planescape team at TSR.", 
      "There will be some other surprise talent that I’ll announce later on but I thought it important to stress the heritage of the great team we have. I feel quite confident that the players of PST will feel comfortable and appreciate the experience being created.", 
      "Fargo: Absolutely. There are obvious advantages to Kickstarter for both developers and backers. We get our games funded without dealing with a crazy publisher and the backer gets a game for much less than what the finished product would cost non-backers. But beyond that, the benefit of crowd funding is that it provides feedback and accountability to the people who are actually going to play the game. It validates the concept and helps us prioritize the sensibilities of the project. We are not forced to compromise for the thought of how the “mass market” might react. It’s a wonderfully pure process and one that hinges on trust.", 
      "RPS – Can you talk about why Wizards of the Coast were resistant to licensing Planescape again?", 
      "Fargo: We asked and were rebuffed. In reality we didn’t push very hard on licensing it as the team was excited to work with Monte on Numenera and they felt that there would be less creative restriction. And WotC has been pretty silent on this space for some time. Neither Feargus nor I was able to get a Baldur’s Gate 3 project going.", 
      "RPS – Did you meet any resistance when seeking the Torment name?", 
      "Fargo: I patiently waited for someone to do something with a Torment concept but nothing happened. After many years the rights expired and allowed me to step in and put together a great team to make another title of its kind. We will improve on the mechanics and deliver a deep narrative story that is deserving of the name Torment.", 
      "RPS – Thanks for your (pause-)time.", 
      "Now that sounds more like it could go with the Torment name. Good.", 
      "They had me until “real time with pause.”", 
      "A successor to a RTwP game is also RTwP. Shocker!", 
      "yeah it, uh, is actually.", 
      "But yes, it’s not as if that’s some radical departure from Planescape.  I’m more excited about the combat possibly not being horrible.", 
      "I was expecting it to be an FPS, actually.", 
      "It would have been if EA had acquired the license. Too bad they couldn’t get PS from the tightwads at WotC. I would have loved to have seen Fall-From-Grace appear in another game. Always my favorite character from RPGs.", 
      "Must agree on fall from grace.  However, and this is hard because it involves revealing my 40ness, but I’d love, love love, to have more games with gold box d&d style combat.", 
      "(Thank god for Age of Decadence)", 
      "Yeah, Balder’s Gate 1 and 2 were RTwP and we all know how much they sucked.  Am I right!?", 
      "Careful.  That’s Wizardry’s personal Bat-signal.", 
      "Thanks for making my day, that made me laugh far too much.", 
      "Wizardry, we love you despite all your stubborn arguments, come and discuss rpg’s again on RPS :(", 
      "I thought the combat sections in Icewind Dale 1 and 2 (which is to say, most of the game) were really good, in the sense that they made positioning and movement in the map really important. There’s only so many tactics you could adopt in 1 with the fighter, though, but if you had mages/druids/rogues things could get very interesting when facing several types of enemies. I agree that in BG it’s a bit different, and combat is just one more step in the way somewhere, but I also think that it was that way mostly because of the design of the maps. The tactical choices were mostly reduced to ‘what weapon am I gonna use for this’ instead of being about movement, but IWD did that right in general IMHO, especially in the mid-to-late game.", 
      "Agreed. I made a thread about it actually. Icewind Dale 2 in particular was the first time I’ve ever had to use my thief as a scout to find enemies and prepare attacks. It really feels like a true tactical real time RPG.",

      "They have me despite RTwP. But they most definitely have me.", 
      "Again, Monte Cook didn’t create Planescape. He was a major designer on it, but it was created by David “Zeb* Cook.", 
      "And while we’re at it, look at some of Tony DiTerlizzi’s artwork for the setting.", 
      "Tody DiTerlizzi killed it on the books, but if I remember correctly it was Dana Knutson’s sketches that were said to have sold the management on the planescape concept. He is an extraordinary artist and you would do yourselves a favour to look up some of his work.", 
      "Agreed, Dana drew some great stuff.", 
      "#morethanoneperson", 
      "No?", 
      "To be fair, I’m pretty sure it’s not a case of Wizards of the Coast withholding the Planescape setting so much as the ongoing legal clusterfuck between Hasbro and Atari preventing any D&D property being developed as a video game.", 
      "It is a damn shame too, because the recently deceased 4ed of D&D could have made for some spectacular turn-based tactics games.", 
      "I am in agreeance with your sadness.", 
      "All we get is this faux NWN bullshit :(", 
      "WOAH there.  Woah.", 
      "NWN, the original with the expansions, were probably some of the best RPG’s that ever came out.  I have not found a more immersive, true to 3.5, and fun RPG.  The length was phenomenal, the combat was stellar, character leveling and items/artifacts great, they offered not only probably the best graphical depiction of 3.5 for dungeonmasters to use, but an incredible campaign to go along with it.  And it could be played through with a full party as well.", 
      "If you could name RPG’s based on DnD 3.5 that come even close to NWN I’d be surprised, as well as thankful for something new to dive into.", 
      "The Temple of Elemental Evil", 
      "ToEE had great strategic combat and not-so-great everything else.  If you’re looking for a D&D dungeon crawl (which, let’s be honest, is where D&D’s strength lies), ToEE is the best.  If you’re looking for good story, characters, role-play, and all those other things we generally associate with RPGs, you’ll have to look elsewhere.", 
      "Absolutely.", 
      "NWN – the original – was great with a party of friends and terrible single-player.  It was one of the most boring RPGs – from both a story and gameplay perspective.  It was more concerned about being true to D&D mechanics than about being fun single-player.  It wasn’t until the 2nd expansion that we got a decent single-player RPG from it.", 
      "4ed would have been magic on the computer, as turn based or rtwp.  I think Obsidian is taking a lot of ideas from it for Project Eterenity though (which sounds more interesting with each update from JE Sawyer and Tim Cain).  In Project Eternity spells will be like encounter powers or dailies when a character first gets them, and then move down to at-wills as they grow more powerful.", 
      "That’s how spells work, but will they have the balls to make fighter exploits work that way too?", 
      "I don’t think so.  I always thought 4e fighters had a bit too many moves anyways.  Not because of that wizards are superior nonsense, but just because you end up doing stupid things like kneebreaker on a giant earthworm, etc.  I would like to see most melee classes on a continuum between reaction and offense, and possibly subdivided by what monsters they specialize against.  4e melee classes are offensive most of the time, with very few reactive abilities.", 
      "It’d be neat to have a monk punch a dragon in the throat when it breathes in, and then have the fighter tackle the wizard when a claw comes his way or jump in front of a fireball.", 
      "That wouldn’t be impossible to design either.  Fighters choose to be defensive or offensive as their turn starts, and get a separate move list for each one.", 
      "That’s a bit of a long aside, and 4e would still make an awesome video game.", 
      "Yeah.  Funny that that’s the key problem with 4e as a PnP system; it was designed to be an awesome video game.", 
      "Not really, it just took the lessons learned over 30 years of video game RPG’s and applied them to the stalest and most conservative game in tabletop.", 
      "Haven’t they already said that they intend to allow the player to choose how they wish to craft their character (within class constraints)?  So, take a Warrior – you’ll be able to focus heavily on activated abilities if that’s your thing, or you can just go for passives and perform a similarly decent job, with less active input on the behalf of the user.", 
      "Sounds good to me – I mean, obviously the min-maxers will find the optimum builds and there’ll be people who complain, but they all take things far too seriously.  (Though I’m sure we’ve all dabbled in a bit of min-maxing).", 
      "@Gritz:", 
      "I dunno about that.  I’m completely new to PnP, and had never played a single game from any PnP system until about six weeks ago.  4e is my first.  I’ve also been playing video game RPGs for almost twenty years.  I am the target market.  I should love it, right?", 
      "January 9th and you’ve already given me the best news of the year. It’s all going to go downhill from now on :(", 
      "If they want this project’s kickstarter to succeed, they should start it after WL2 is out and everybody can see if the potential of crowd-funded games really can be realized by them.", 
      "Best of luck to them.", 
      "Absolutely this.  I put a substantial amount of my game budget into kickstarter last year.  I’d like to see how it turns out before giving more.", 
      "“We know it hasn’t been done often in the game industry, but we’re envisioning Torment as a thematic franchise with certain themes that can expand over different settings and stories.”", 
      "I like the sound of that…. Kinda like the Bioshock idea….. I think that’s a great way to please both people who complain about all the sequels that are being made and people who want to play new games in their beloved franchises", 
      "Goddamit, RPS! I had sworn not to spend any money on Kickstarters in 2013 and now you directly call upon my inner Tiefling and get me all hyped again… *grumble, grumble*", 
      "Sounds good.",

That’s it.  There’s no saving the world, no BEHOLD THE DARK DOOM OF DOOMDARK.

He gave Dakkon false information which led to doubt, but that doubt already existed inside Dakkon, and Dakkon obsessed over it.  I don’t remember much of Annah, but her torment was related to her preconceived notions of a hostile world.  He set Morte up to sin, let him wind up on the pile of skulls, and then pulled him out and created a dependency.  Deionarra chose to dwell over him, perhaps because she originally could not believe he didn’t love her.  Fall From Grace was obsessed with  what she was.  Etc.",

      "I’m super excited to see this happen as a childhood fan of the original, and I’m confident that the end result will be fantastic, But I am a little concerned at how the this new setting is gonna play out. In My opinion, the world of Planescape is one of the most interesting worlds ever with its unique looking architecture of the buildings, the various species and characters, and the overall concept of the world itself (Different Planes of existence connected through various portals).", 
      "At the Time, for me at least, just the world itself broke away from the cliche RPG settings and provided a completely fresh game world that even to this day still holds up. It broke the regular routine of getting a quest from a towns person, traveling through the forest to the dungeon, looting the dungeon, returning to town, and repeat, a lot of the quests were unique and had multiple ways to go about solving them, each one resulting in a different scenario that could affect you later in the game. It had a completely different world compared to anything else at the time with vast forests and undeground dungeons replaced by sprawling industrial-like cities and unique quest settings. Instead of the regular fantasy cast of elves, dwarfs and orcs, It introduced a whole slew of new and interesting races and species.", 
      "Looking at some of the images of Numenara, it looks much more like a traditional fantasy setting (They remind me of some of Roger Dean’s paintings) as opposed to Planescape. I do like the character designs, but the overall world just looks too “Traditional” for me (Especially with the dragon). It doesn’t look bad mind you, and I have confidence that the end result will be faithful to the original concept of Torment. But just the uniqueness of the world of Planescape was enough in itself to make for a memorable experience.", 
      "But aren’t you being a traditionalist about your untraditional setting?", 
      "If you mean that I’m defending the nontraditional setting because I prefer nontraditional settings as opposed to the more commonly used settings out there, then sure I prefer settings that are not as  commonly seen compared to the majority of game settings out there. But that said, I have no problems with more traditional fantasy themes, I love the Elder Scrolls series and other D&D Video Games like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur’s Gate that use more commonplace fantasy elements like forests and elves and orcs and such.", 
      "I was talking more-so about how at the time when Planescape: Torment came out, there was a surplus of fantasy themed games that had a lot of the same setting elements with very little creativity. It was one of the first games of the time to truly break from the overused concepts of the time and provide a unique world unlike any other.", 
      "Remember though, this is all stemming from my initial opinion of seeing some of the Numenara artwork. In the end, I could be wrong and the world could be nothing like how it appears in the images. Plus I’ve no knowledge of the Numenara universe itself and the various races and such. But the initial images, like the one of the Ice glacier with the dragon and the one of the huge grassy plain with the floating monument-thing, makes it look more like a generic fantasy setting as opposed to the dark brooding industrial slightly-Gothic world that made Planescape what it is.", 
      "And I have no doubts about the storyline or the game itself. I’m confident that they will be able to create a story that can will stay faithful to the concept of torment. I’m just curious as to how it will play out in this new setting.", 
      "Note they got Dana Knutson closely involved already, and he’s the guy who designed/helped create things like the Lady of Pain for Planescape. Numenera’s own art are the starting point obviously but with Dana’s involvement I’m pretty optimistic they can give it a PS:T-esque twist.", 
      "Setting-wise it’s pretty open, just depends on the area you’re in. Some of the safer villages will feel more like traditional fantasy, but once you go into weirder, high-tech heritage areas – and this game definitely will – you can get a lot more creative.", 
      "The Numenera setting reminds me a bit of the world written of by Gene Wolfe in the Shadow of the Torturer/Book of the New Sun setting.", 
      "A world so old that races have evolved to scavenge the buried cities of ancient ages.  Where beam weapons co-exist with genetically manipulated destriers used for lance charging cavalry.  Deadly alien flora and fauna have completely naturalized and the beaches are made up of brilliant coloured plastic sand.", 
      "Pretty exciting, but I’d like to see Fargo and friends get some runs on the board with Wasteland 2 before I move past the “cautious interest” stage.",

      "Back in 1996, we released Daggerfall, the second game in The Elder Scrolls series. In just a few months of working here at Bethesda, I’ve come to learn that it is a beloved title for many fans because of its depth and ambitious gameplay.", 
      "When did you first get into the Elder Scrolls, and when did you first get involved with modding the games?", 
      "I’ve played all Elder Scrolls games except for Arena. Daggerfall got me involved as no other game before it. I’ve been hooked ever since. As far as modding goes, I took my first steps with the Morrowind Construction Set and released a couple of mods, but I didn’t really get into it before Oblivion.", 
      "I’d say at least 500 hours in a 5 month arc.", 
      "Well, I had already released mods involving heavy scripting and weather modifications, but I had to learn all of the Construction Set’s features. I also learned how to create 3d models for the game. I’d say worldspace building and learning 3d modeling were the two most troubling aspects. Oh, and the voice acting, since me and my girlfriend did about 20 english-speaking characters and we’re Italian…", 
      "As far as smaller issues go, I had hundreds, such as discovering how to make a faction icon appear in-game (trickier than it seems) and so on. I have to say that the modding community helped me out a whole lot in a myriad of situations. Really incredible bunch of people. Probably the most helpful were ScripterRon (Ron Hoffman) and dev_akm (Aubrey K McAuley), the guys responsible for the Tes4Gecko utility. It is really indispensable for making big landscape mods work all the way through. Thanks guys!", 
      "The quest is quite detailed but not so long, not more than a couple of hours I’d say. The detail went mostly into building this island trying to make it different from everything else in the vanilla game. The quest is fairly different too, and it introduces the storyline I hope to develop in future mods.", 
      "The quest takes place on Cybiades island, which you can travel to in the Daggerfall game. It was a deserted island then, you’ll see it’s quite livelier now:).", 
      "I put in quite a few references to the lore and specifically the Daggerfall storyline. There is one surprise that all fans of Daggerfall will surely appreciate. Let’s just say the storyline suggests a link between some of the heroes introduced in various Elder Scrolls games.", 
      "The landscape. While retaining Oblivion’s graphical qualities, it has a Daggerfall feel somehow. At least that’s how I see it. It is slightly barren and haunting, but that’s exactly how I wanted it to be.", 
      "There is also a Morrowind touch I think. I tried to flesh out the characters with a distinct personality and some quirky details, and this at the end reminded me of many Morrowind npcs.", 
      "Yes, I’m about to start working on a dungeon expansion to the island, which should bring the storyline a step forward.", 
      "Well, I’m caressing the idea of going forward with the Daggerfall theme actually. But what I have in mind may be too much work: I’d like to release a Betony mod, rebuilding the whole island with fully detailed cities, npcs, dungeons, wildlife… For Cybiades I have used almost all the features in the Construction Set, but Betony is quite bigger so I don’t think I would be able to pull it off.", 
      "No, I’ve done something for some first person shooters years ago but I really am mostly into The Elder Scrolls games.", 
      "Well, I have to say it would probably be the ideal job for me, I absolutely love it. But I’m Italian and not so young anymore, so it will remain an unrealized dream.",

People that bought Daggerfall in the past is going to buy Daggerfall again providing that it is vista compatible. You are right though we do need ro stop lingering in the past but there is alot of us out there that just loves the crap out of this game, minus the bugs of course hehe. In fact it has inspired me to become a graphic designer. Thanks to you and your team.",

I've tried to improve\nthis by including a radar-like mini-map, a separate top-down map window,\nand high resolution support.", 
      "At one point, I thought about making an interface with 3D models of\neach tile, a full 3D version of Falcon's Eye in a sense. This would be\nrather easy programming-wise, since only the actual tile drawing would\nchange -- most other graphics and background logic would be the same. I\nintended to add artificial elevation differences, just to make the levels\nlook more interesting. I decided against the 3D version, since I felt it\nwould make the game confusing; tile-based movement and keyboard\ncompatibility might suffer.",

I might add \"static\" animation like flickering torches,\nrunning fountains, creatures glancing around, etc. \"Dynamic\" animation\nlike walking is more difficult for a number of reasons. First, to work\nwell, it needs separate animations for each movement direction. Second,\nthe interface then needs to find out what happened between turns. NetHack\ndoesn't provide this by default. Neither is impossible to solve, but they\ndo require more background logic for the interface.", 
      "Having a self-made wrapper -- instead of, for example, using SDL\nthroughout -- is useful since Falcon's Eye can then also support platforms\nthat SDL does not, like DOS. When the underlying API (such as DirectX or\nSDL) is well-designed, the wrapper doesn't need to do much -- at best it\nsimply passes on its parameters -- so it doesn't slow down the game with\nmuch overhead. Also, if a future version of DirectX or SDL were to change\nthe API to improve hardware support, I could simply change the contents of\nthe self-made wrapper functions to match.", 
      "Since I had already used similar APIs, I didn't perhaps learn as much\nas when I started GUI development earlier. I didn't look at SDL's\nimplementation details behind the API. I'm sure I'd have much to learn\nthere.", 
      "NetHack's portability across different computer systems -- UNIX, DOS,\nLinux, Windows, Amiga, Mac, different processor types, and so on -- is\nquite incredible. It goes beyond the display alone and includes\nconsiderations for things like file handling and compiler\nspecifics. Although I don't intend to support Falcon's Eye across as wide\na range of platforms, it does help me understand which kinds of\nplatform-specific features and programming solutions to avoid.", 
      "There are several routes for improving clarity. For example, character\napplications are usually oriented for a rather small display with few rows\nand columns. By contrast, many though not all GUI applications can assume\nthere is a moderate amount of screen area available. Restructuring the\ndisplay for more space can make it clearer. The GUI graphics also affect\nthis; they can help associate related components, but too many graphical\neffects can make GUIs look cluttered.", 
      "Character applications are naturally restricted to character symbols,\nso they may need to draw complex structures (arrows, boxes, diagrams,\nbuttons) with characters. A GUI can draw these in a more intuitive\nway. Also, GUI applications can use color or other highlighting where\ncharacter applications need separate messages, capitals, etc., and can\nprovide more feedback by tooltips, sub-windows or other means.", 
      "Regarding speed, in a highly evolved character application, the\nkeyboard usage is probably already well optimized. Simply adding buttons\nfor key presses won't make much difference. Instead, one should consider\nhow the mouse can best be used in tandem with the keyboard. For example,\ncharacter applications often have an \"active area\" for user input, with a\ncommand line or text menu, and the rest of the screen is for information\nonly. This can make the active area feel cramped. In a GUI, the entire\napplication area can accept user input.", 
      "Overall, the GUI should work in concert with the keyboard interface.\nEspecially with widely used programs, users have learned how to use the\ncharacter interface quickly, and changing this functionality probably\nhurts the overall speed and adds an unnecessary learning step. The GUI\nshould instead provide alternatives. Some users may eventually use a\ncombination midway between the old and new interfaces. Allowing this can\nsometimes mean making several different ways to do a task, which takes\nconsiderable work in both design and implementation, but I believe it is\nwell worth the trouble.", 
      "I often start out designing an interface simply by creating a mock-up\nimage of how it should look. On the basis of the image, I can judge how\nthe program logic should be arranged. What is the function hierarchy,\nwhich structures are fixed and which need to be modifiable, how does the\nprogram flow through the task? When the basic layout is fixed, I finalize\nthe look of each component, often simultaneously with the code that uses\nit, which helps with testing.", 
      "If I started with code alone, I might stress \"elegant\" coding\nsolutions, which can sometimes be cumbersome in practice: too simple\nhierarchies can lead to overly complex data representation and vice\nversa. Looking at the graphics gives me a user's perspective, which helps\nfind the necessary programming compromises. On the other hand, knowing\nimplementation details helps keep in mind what ideas are easy to realize,\nso that I don't draw interfaces too difficult to program.", 
      "This kind of development can sometimes mean I need to draw the\ninterface graphics several times over if I do change the program\nstructure. Also, sometimes I can spend too much time over graphics when I\nshould concentrate on programming, design or sound; if one area lags\nbehind others, I might not be able to effectively test them together.", 
      "Overall, though, I think there are more positive than negative effects\nfrom knowing these areas. It can also help with long development periods\n-- if I temporarily grow tired of drawing or sound design, I can switch to\nprogramming, and back again later.",

      "I recently talked with Hajo Malthaner about his project Iso-Angband, which unfortunately does not seem to have fared very well. Malthaner argues that fans of Roguelikes simply don't like the idea of graphics and were resistant. Do you have the same problem with your game's reception? Is the community just not happy about the idea?", 
      "My experience with NetHack - Falcon's Eye has been different; I feel there has been a lot of interest. In more concrete terms, there have been over 178000 downloads on SourceForge.net of the Windows version alone (over 238000 of all packages in total), and the game has even been included in some Linux distributions. I've personally received over a thousand emails about the project.", 
      "I don't think there is a single \"community opinion\" about graphics. In particular, long-time roguelike fans and casual players may have different tastes.", 
      "Certainly there are many who prefer text-mode interfaces (or simple graphical tiles). They have some concrete advantages: for example, as often mentioned, they show a whole dungeon level at once, which large graphics cannot do. It is also a matter of taste: long-time roguelike fans might be used to text-mode interfaces.", 
      "On the other hand, for people who discover roguelikes nowadays, non-graphical roguelikes may seem disappointing compared to commercial games, despite the complexity of the underlying gameplay. Graphical interfaces can be appealing to such people and thus can introduce new players to the genre: many people who have played NetHack - Falcon's Eye have apparently discovered or rediscovered NetHack through the new graphical look.", 
      "Note, though, that in NetHack - Falcon's Eye the interface does more than simply use a graphical tileset; there's music, sounds, and a point-and-click interface instead of the typical keyboard interface. Maybe that helps make the result interesting to people who don't see enough benefits in graphical tiles alone.", 
      "In an age of highly sophisticated CRPGs, it's surprising that the roguelikes are still so widely played and enjoyed today. What is about these games that continues to appeal to modern gamers?", 
      "From one viewpoint, I think roguelikes represent a kind of distilled CRPG gameplay. Modern CRPGs use a lot of scripted sequences and plot exposition; the benefits for storytelling are obvious, but the drawback is that part of the playing time is spent on setting up the situation, and the player must follow along. By comparison, in roguelikes plot, dialogue, puzzles and character interaction are minimal but the actual gameplay of dungeon-delving is in many ways just as sophisticated as in other CRPGs. I think the only significant gameplay feature missing in roguelikes is having a party of multiple characters. This kind of \"distilled to the essentials\" gameplay can be very appealing.", 
      "How long have you been playing roguelikes? Can you talk about your earliest exposure to this genre, and the games you played? Why \"Nethack\" instead of one of the other roguelikes?", 
      "I am not a harcore roguelike player, but more of a casual player. I have played a large amount of CRPGs (ranging from old Ultimas and Gold Box AD&D games to Baldurs Gates and Elder Scrolls games), but I was never that much interested in roguelikes.", 
      "I soon looked for another game whose graphics I could upgrade, and of course, that is much easier to do for a game with source code available. I don't remember whether I looked for roguelikes especially, but eventually I thought of NetHack.", 
      "Why I thought of NetHack is a mixture of several reasons. It is one of the more well-known roguelikes, and I have also seen it mentioned occassionally in the Finnish gaming magazine \"Pelit\" (they have even reviewed it twice), so you could say NetHack had good publicity. I had also played NetHack before - I remember having it on a 3.5 inch diskette - but I don't recall my first encounter with it anymore.", 
      "NetHack is also technically well structured so that creating a graphical interface is reasonably easy - I just had to write new versions of a few key parts, instead of making changes throughout the source code. That made it possible to finish the project without becoming an expert on all aspects of the code. I think this would not have been so easy in some other roguelikes.", 
      "At least later on, with NetHack - Falcon's Eye already released, I had considered making graphical upgrades for other roguelikes too. In particular, Angband interested me, but I was concerned about its non-opensource license and about possible copyright issues with the Tolkien influences. I did create an Angband title screen graphic for fun, but that's as far as it went.", 
      "Nowadays I have of course played roguelikes much more, both while testing my changes and just for fun. You could say that, through the NetHack - Falcon's Eye project, I made it easier for myself too to get into roguelikes.", 
      "Interestingly, the original Rogue was never a commercial success even back in the early 1980s. Why do you think roguelikes haven't appealed more to the average gamer? Is the love of the game just somehow tied up with the UNIX and GNU/Linux communities?", 
      "There are historical reasons for the UNIX or GNU/Linux connection; free (open source) software development coincides well with developing free games. However, I don't think the attraction of roguelikes is in any way limited to UNIX/Linux users. In fact, there have been successful commercial games that are at least related to roguelikes; the most well-known are likely the Diablo games, and there have been many similar ones since, e.g. the Sacred games, Titan Quest, and others. 3D dungeon crawling games like Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder were also rather similar to roguelikes, which was most apparent in \"Dungeon Hack\".", 
      "The lack of graphics and sound certainly hurts initial perception of the traditional roguelikes. Screenshots are probably among the first things one looks at when one learns about a new game. If the visuals and audio seem poor, few gamers will stay interested long enough to download the game, or play long enough to discover the fun in the underlying gameplay, especially since they may have better-looking CRPGs to spend time on.", 
      "Traditional roguelikes can also have a high learning curve - there are no in-game tutorials, and many things can only be learned through accident, experiments, or by reading \"spoilers\" on the internet. Moreover, the games are very challenging, not least because there often is no real savegame feature, so players cannot retry failures except by backing up some files outside the game. Average gamers might not enjoy \"Yet Another Stupid Death\" requiring them to restart.", 
      "So what should be done if one wanted to make roguelikes more appealing to average gamers, or even commercially appealing?", 
      "To lower the learning curve, I think savegames should be allowed in standard roguelike gameplay. This does not mean discarding the traditional \"see how far you can get\" play type: playing without reloading could be a voluntary challenge that the game keeps track of, much like NetHack keeps track of various other conducts.", 
      "A commercial roguelike would almost certainly add graphics, sound (as a well-supported option at least), as well as tutorials and savegames. The downsides of large graphics can, I think, be dealt with; for example the issue of seeing the whole dungeon level could be addressed by map displays, like I've tried to do in NetHack -Falcon's Eye.", 
      "For free roguelikes this would of course mean a lot of work creating graphics and sounds. Perhaps there could be some common repository of free roguelike graphics and sounds to draw from; while there would still be problems related to mismatching graphics styles, tile scales and orientations, etc., it might still reduce the workload.", 
      "What are your long-term plans for your game?", 
      "I am somewhat ashamed about this - at times I've said I intend to release a new version over some span of time, yet that has always failed. On the other hand, it's very gratifying to notice how much people remain interested in the game; in particular, I should mention the hard work of the people in the \"Vulture's\" project, who started a \"fork\" of the game to maintain ongoing development.", 
      "The graphics and whole overhaul concept are very well done and the fact that he did all this for free is even more impressive.  Great stuff.  I hope to someday get to try it.",

      "The added gaming elements that Slash'EM adds to NetHack include:", 
      "Slash'EM is written in C, with its Qt windowing interface in C++. Of\ncourse, because of its NetHack lineage, the current release contains lots\nof code which the present team did not develop originally. Normally,\nincorporating code from outside a project can be a problem due to\nincompatibilities among various open source licenses, but things work\ndifferently within the NetHack family.  J. Ali Harlow, 36, a programmer\nfor the Applied Vision Research Centre of City University in London,\nEngland and one of the current maintainers of Slash'EM, says, \"There's no\nsuch problem with code that has been written to be used with NetHack. We\nseek to use the best of these whenever possible.\"", 
      "Cheung, 23, today works as a Computer Science research assistant at the\nUniversity of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia.  He says\nthat the hardest technical challenge that he surmounted in creating\nSlash'EM was the very first one: combining the Slash variant and Wizard\nPatch together.  At that point he had no knowledge of C and had never\ncompiled anything before.  His first attempt at merging the two\nfailed. About a year went by before he gave the idea another shot and,\nthat time, he got it to work. Slash'EM was born. \"Whenever I'm writing any\ncode that doesn't work,\" reflects Cheung, \"I just think back to that and\ntell myself, 'If I could make Slash'EM work without knowing anything about\nprogramming C, I can at least do this.'\"", 
      "One of the continuing technical challenges has been perfecting Slash'EM's\nproxy window interface. The concept of a proxy window interface is relatively\nsimple: the game runs as one process and the window interface runs as another,\nseparate process. They may perhaps even run on different machines.  But they\nneed to talk to each other using a mutually-understood protocol.", 
      "The next challenge for him deals with the fact that all existing window\ninterfaces have been part of the main process, and so they have had access\nto the variables and functions of the game. NetHack has a well-defined API\nfor use when the game calls window interfaces, but very little in the way\nof an API for the window interface to use when querying the game. The\nremedy for this has had to be designed from scratch.", 
      "\"The process is complicated by the fact that we need to be flexible\nenough that future window interfaces will have everything they need, but\nnot so flexible that an external window interface could be used to cheat\nwhen playing with an official binary,\" says Harlow. \"I believe I have\nachieved the latter, but I'm still a long way off achieving the\nformer.\"", 
      "The next release of Slash'EM (code-named \"Vampire\") has been in\ndevelopment for almost two years. (The Slash'EM project team is hoping to\nrelease the first beta early this year.) Some of the new features include:", 
      "Advising those who want to develop yet another flavor of NetHack or\ninterface to add to the game's family, Harlow suggests, \"Whatever you\ndecide to do, make sure that you're doing it because you enjoy it and not\njust because you think it should be done. Try and understand how long it\nis going to take you to do what you're planning, and decide if you can\nreally afford the time.  There's nothing more soul-destroying than a\nhalf-completed job.\"", 
      "Ironically, Cheung would not recommend that others attempt what he did,\nwhich was to begin by looking at the NetHack source code without prior\nknowledge of C. Things will be much easier if you're not trying to both\nfigure out the programming language and what the program is doing--this\nmight be obvious but he thinks it's worth emphasizing.", 
      "\"Start with a small modification, then work out all the ramifications,\"\nsays Cheung. \"It's amazing how everything in NetHack can interact, and the\nplayer can do almost any action with any object. So one simple addition\ncan lead to many more ideas that are interconnected. NetHack is an\namazingly complex program, and small changes can have far-reaching,\nunexpected effects.\"", 
      "Although he himself has much less time now to work on the project he\nstarted, Cheung is amazed that Slash'EM continues going so strongly in the\nopen source gaming community without his regular involvement and by how\nit's affected him personally: \"My long history with Slash'EM has led to it\nbecoming part of how I think. Whenever I'm playing a new game or watching\na movie, one of the thoughts that will invariably cross my mind is, 'This\nwould make a neat addition to Slash'EM.'\"",

      "For me, it came easy. I grew up sitting around with my D&D buddies talking about what our own Alien film would be like, or playing through a Traveller campaign based on The Terminator, and even in these early experiments, we were nailing the tone of our beloved franchises.", 
      "It was only later, when I came into the industry, that I realized that this was something that was even an issue for people. Working on the James Bond franchise, I was stunned by how many people wanted to utterly change the very nature of that character, simply to suit their personal creative tastes. While I could understand the drive to create, doesn't James Bond deserve to be James Bond?", 
      "So, I developed the \"Magic Gun\": a way of thinking about what I think of as \"other people's ideas\" that could help my teams re-orient their thinking. It's easy to learn... but extraordinarily difficult to master.",

In my opinion, only Raven's most recent effort shows the greatness of that character, and that was due to their ability to utterly embrace the character's core constraints: his claws.", 
      "The solution to this, as illustrated by Raven, is to allow him to leap... and to give the game an M-rating. That one key factor -- the ability to slice up your enemies -- made all the difference in the game.

But there is a magic gun. I can show you the weapon, I can teach you how it works...but you have to make your own bullets, and have to learn how to fire it yourself -- much moreso, in fact, than with most game development advice.", 
      "Seasoned industry professionals such as Gaikai's David Perry, independent developer Adam Saltsman, Zynga's Louis Castle, Gazillion's Dan Fiden, and Ngmoco's Alan Yu all discussed the most pertinent business strategies of the last few years, as part of their drive to inspire submission ideas for the GDC 2012 Main Conference.", 
      "How do you all think downloadable and free-to-play titles have affected the business strategies for traditional, boxed retail games?", 
      "Looking around, it's as if the video game industry, including mobile, is driven by three things in this order: Convenience, low price (Free to try), and high quality -- if you have all three you have a slam dunk. The X factor is how easy you make it to share. Boxed retail games fail on two out of three key drivers -- convenience and low price -- therefore they are ticking time bombs.", 
      "Part of me is worried that box games are in the process of getting renamed and re-monetized the same way: \"super deluxe special edition tin box with army helmet and real gun, only $250!\" But the other part of me is really happy, because I know there will always be a free demo for the next big AAA game that I can download and check out, instead of having to take the big $60 (or $250!) gamble every time.", 
      "And there is a happy possible future where games are simply priced based on how you engage them. If you just want to play through the first chapter of a game and see what the controls and graphics are like, that will have one price (maybe free). If you want to pore over the whole game for 200 hours, then that can be a different price. This makes sense for people and for bandwidth I think, but there are a lot of opportunities for the system to be manipulated to work against the audience. This is going to be an interesting few years for any industry that used to sell chunks of data in a box.", 
      "How soon this industry will be forced to accept the change will depend on how long console makers will hold on to the current model. The market forces have little to no effect if you are one of the major franchises, but everyone else is already having to deal with the difficulties of getting players to pay when free options are readily available.", 
      "Will I be able to go in to GameStop and pick up the client for the next Blizzard MMO for free? Will that client be glued to the side of every carton of eggs I buy? Are endcaps full of a bazillion game cards the final evolution of what it means to sell games at retail? I suspect someone will figure out how to evolve retail in an interesting way.", 
      "Looking at my own behavior, I won't buy any box product that isn't a surefire hit -- which often means a 90+ Metacritic. And perhaps a more interesting observation is that I only wind up playing these games over Thanksgiving or Christmas break, when I have large amounts of free time that I don't have over the course of the rest of the year. The experience of AAA box titles doesn't really fit my lifestyle and playing habits anymore. I'm sure this is true of many other gamers who have gotten older.", 
      "What are some of the greatest business or marketing challenges facing the industry today?", 
      "Lots changed as a result of that shift -- pricing and form factors changed, power-shifted from certain distributors to others, the importance of labels and traditional marketing diminished. But the core product remained the same -- a person still plays an instrument into a recording device, decides when the song is done, and then someone else listens to it.", 
      "Games are in the middle of a similar shift from retail to digital, disrupting the publishing and retail side of the business. But we're simultaneously shifting from product to service, which disrupts the development side of the business much more significantly.", 
      "The way games are forecast and budgeted is fundamentally different. The job roles and skill sets required to be successful are different, the way organizations are structured is different. In my opinion the companies that will be most successful in the coming years will not be the ones who can figure out how to sell the same games they packaged up for Walmart in 2005 on Steam in 2011, they will be the ones who can learn how to integrate distribution and monetization deeply into the design of their games, meaning that they figure out how to get \"business\" and \"creative\" people to sit next to each other and collaborate from day one.", 
      "The successful companies will understand how to ship early, they know what data to collect and how to act on it, and they'll be able to move fast. Game studios and publishers traditionally work very similarly to movie or TV studios. Now they need work like web service companies. It's a tremendous shift.", 
      "Do you believe in the future of consoles, the future of cloud gaming, or none of the above?", 
      "But there is another scenario where we are shopping for a game online, buy it with a couple clicks, download it in five minutes and start playing it locally. With monthly bandwidth caps a likely part of the future of US internet infrastructure, this is a system that will stay relevant. I can easily imagine a future where consoles are tiny, low-power devices with a spacious SSD, which can play a certain class of game locally, and a different class of games via the cloud.", 
      "How far away is real, high-quality gaming in a web browser? One year? Two? When does Apple really attack the living room? Games are going to be played from the couch, but I wouldn't bet it's going to be on a device manufactured by the same folks owning that space now.",

      "Since then, millions of gamers have ventured into its fantasy MMO universe, which has hosted 17 expansion packs, as well as multiple spinoff console titles, sequels, novelizations and even a board game.", 
      "Each of the industry veterans will outline their company's philosophies on game development, teaching attendees what needs to happen before a publisher decides to support a game.", 
      "Paananen's talk, referencing the Finnish firm's popular browser MMO, will discuss how browser-based games can combine the benefits of social networks with the appeal of hardcore games, simultaneously offering both accessibility and depth. Paananen will also note the obstacles that come with developing for a browser, and his talk will outline \"a lot of challenges that must be addressed.\"", 
      "The industry's flagship Game Developers Conference will take place at San Francisco's Moscone Center on March 5-9, 2012, and will once again serve as the premier industry event for developers to make connections, share ideas, and find inspiration.", 
      "\"The GDC Advisory Board has made improving the quality of presented talks its number one goal,\" said Meggan Scavio, general manager of Game Developers Conference events. \"With our new board members and the introduction of a new submissions system, we are able to continue to present talks that are representative of interesting and current work happening in game development each year.\"",

In addition, his upcoming dissertation will discuss intentionally abusive, unbalanced, or broken game design.", 
      "Your talk description says you examined \"traditional folk games, design research, and precedents in other media forms\" when looking at alternative methods of multiplayer games. Can you describe what this research entailed and what you learned from it?", 
      "What would you say are the essential components of a successful multiplayer game?", 
      "Boy, that's a tough one! I don't think there's any one formula. There are so many different types of multiplayer games. Plus, multiplayer fun is always so dependent on the particular people playing and the setting and context. For that reason, I only put so much faith in the game system itself. After all, with the right attitude or the right group of friends, you can make almost any activity fun - even a putatively \"bad\" game.",

      "\"Then the presenter playing God looked down and saw a crippled man standing before him. He was short and wore rimless glasses. With one hand he gripped a metal walker, and with the other he reached up for Chain World. I can't believe this is happening, Rohrer thought. He placed the stick in the man's palm. What he said next was misheard by several people as 'Be healed' but it was actually more of a startled bleat: 'Hunn-yaaaaaayy!' Rohrer returned to the dais, and the man with the walker muttered, 'Thanks,' and bowed his head to the crowd.\"", 
      "Woo and George will go over the studio's process for iteratively developing their tools, while simultaneously using those tools to ship projects and support an active online game.",

      "Kittle will outline the fundamental elements of a successful gamification campaign, and will explain why \"true gamification isn't just points and badges, but it is designing a campaign that provides users with recognition, rewards, status and achievement - and the desire to come back for more.\"", 
      "Taking place November 12-14 at the Shanghai Exhibition Center in Shanghai, China, the event will once again serve as the premier game industry event in China, bringing together influential developers from around the world to share ideas, network, and inspire each other to further the game industry in this region.", 
      "He's lecture will focus particularly on her role as project manager throughout the game's development, outlining the team's approach to designing a Western-focused game, the problems encountered during production, handling team morale, post-launch support, and more.", 
      "In this lecture, Feng will weigh the pros and cons of using homebrewed tools versus middleware, and will show attendees how his studio used custom tools to its advantage to streamline and improve their development pipeline. In addition, he will suggest a number of tools that make indie development easier.", 
      "Drawing from his experience at Gamegou, He will discuss how developers should balance innovation, tenacity, and good business sense to survive in a mobile and indie market that remains in constant flux.", 
      "GDC Europe's Expo Floor, located within the Cologne Congress-Centrum Ost, in Cologne, Germany, will once again showcase the most cutting-edge technologies from the industry's biggest and most influential companies.", 
      "The Expo Floor is open to all GDC Europe pass holders, and provides attendees with numerous opportunities to learn about upcoming products, interact with developers and publishers, and establish business relationships with some of the industry's top professionals.", 
      "In this dedicated area, GDC Europe will host its very own Business Lounge, providing gamescom attendees with a perfect venue for networking, gaining exposure, and more, even after GDC Europe proper officially concludes - with meeting rooms from many of GDC Europe's major exhibitors.", 
      "Of course, GDC Europe will also feature a healthy lineup of lectures, panels, and tutorials during the show proper, and show organizers will continue to debut new sessions as the event draws ever closer.", 
      "Some highlights from these previously announced sessions include talks from the following influential industry professionals:", 
      "In addition to serving as Epic's president, Dr. Capps is also an advisory board member for the Game Developers Conference, and holds a seat on the boards for the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences and the Entertainment Software Association.", 
      "Before entering the game industry, Dr. Capps worked as a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, specializing in defense and entertainment collaboration, virtual reality, and computer graphics. He holds degrees in computer science and electrical engineering from the University of North Carolina and MIT, and a doctorate in computer science from the Naval Postgraduate School.",

      "Cerny notes that \"2009 and 2010 have now shown some erosion in console video game sales,\" and his talk will discuss what this trend could mean for the industry, and why developers might have to adapt to considerable changes in their creative process.", 
      "Drawing examples from the game, Reisberger will outline the challenges of translating a television IP into an online video game, the viral strategy that helped support the project, as well as how to design a game to appeal to international audiences.", 
      "GDC Europe organizers would also like to remind potential attendees that Early Registration pricing for the show will end on Wednesday, July 20th, with reduced-price registration for the event only available until that date.", 
      "\"This talk takes a practical look at how metrics are being used, how they should be used, and how to avoid having well-intentioned data lead to wrong decisions,\" says Wang.", 
      "The longrunning Austin-based show, which continues to expand a robust Expo floor and offer in-depth takeaway from sessions alongside networking opportunities, also has a number of other announcements planned for the upcoming weeks and months.", 
      "The videotapes are starting to pile up in the \"done\" box and the process of turning the resulting video files into more lightweight video streaming files is now well underway, and I'll be adding these talks at a good clip for the coming months.", 
      "To his great credit, Miyamoto provides a presentation about his ideas on game design, the history of Nintendo's entry into the console game market, and a call to innovation, and it's filled with ideas both specific and universal. In other words, he makes it worth the trip.", 
      "And the core message, as I hear it, is that he thinks story and gameplay, with a good dash of artistry, is what brings the games from being mere shoot-em-ups and twitchfests to being something more, something that will stay with people a long time.", 
      "As an unbroken, long-form presentation of evidence that Miyamoto deserves his high regard and hall of fame designer status, this speech is perfect. It lives up to all the promises of any great speech, and is well worth enjoying, even a decade plus later.", 
      "But what I found interesting here was that Iwata still chooses the personal narrative, still stresses his own journey just as Miyamoto does, to tell you to think of these platforms and systems as homes for gamers, and to encourage the spirit of gaming through them.", 
      "Nintendo is as big as they come, but I really like the tone and approach of these speeches -- instead of being product pushes with a smattering of humanity to help with the selling, they're primarily personal stories.", 
      "At least according to these talks, the speaker gives a biographical perspective about what they've learned in their years in the game business, and occasionally showing some new product or idea that they think fulfills that outlook.", 
      "Overall, there's a sense of whimsy in the chosen illustrations, and a nice bunch of history besides. It's quite humbling, to think of it, that while Miyamoto gives his talk about his early days with Nintendo, he is doing so during Nintendo's 110th year as a company.", 
      "Next time: An avalanche of content.", 
      "With GDC Europe just over a month away, Weidemann particularly discussed his upcoming Community Management Summit talk, and outlined the importance of regular developer-to-player interaction, as well as the differences between Facebook and other social channels.", 
      "In your experience, what are the best ways to foster the growth of an online game community?", 
      "The most important thing is service. If your community perceives that you care about them, they stay. Players love the attention, and they'll recommend the service to their friends. It's the best way to grow a game because it's free. Marketing is growing the community fastest, but that growth is meaningless if you don't manage to keep the new users.", 
      "We are still learning. We approached the community for the game with years of experience in community management, and we still had problems satisfying players' needs.", 
      "We established an open communication strategy, but we underestimated the frequency of interaction the users demanded. The internet is moving faster than ever, which means that we need community managers constantly online and talking to users.", 
      "What do you think are the best methods of reaching out to a game community? What sort of channels or platforms do you work through?", 
      "How do you think community management differs between browser-based social games and more traditional titles?", 
      "Social games on Facebook only have the platform itself; I rarely see users talking about their favorite games outside Facebook; only the core users do so. Since Facebook communication is very volatile and temporary, the information there isn't worth as much as it is on forums, where the information stays alive much longer.", 
      "That's why community management on forums is much harder than it is on Facebook, where mistakes aren't as severe. In other words, the community manager on Facebook needs another skill set than the community manager on traditional games, where the skill set is harder to acquire.", 
      "How will your Community Management Summit-specific GDC Europe talk address community management in social games, and what do you expect people to take away from it?", 
      "Community management rules are common for any online platform, even non-game platforms. The difference between Facebook and online games is essentially that on Facebook, you can mix in marketing on a higher level than in traditional games.", 
      "I expect than any community manager or company that has an online audience can take away some key lessons from the talk, as community management for all types of games always has the same target: a human being.", 
      "Some near-final new highlights from these Summits, which have largely rounded out their line-ups, include the following:", 
      "Breslin will discuss the implications of Apple's policy changes regarding freemium games on iOS, and will outline \"the ways in which leading publishers will use strong development relationships and robust player networks to continue driving the growth of freemium.\"", 
      "In this session, Laes will examine the studio's Facebook-based zombie game and outline the team's approach to blending hardcore and casual elements using a systematic creative process \"with an end-user focus.\"", 
      "Titled 'GDC Play' and inspired by the success of the Independent Games Festival Pavilion at GDC, the new initiative will include space in special Pavilions themed around emerging game markets. The program will allow GDC Play exhibitors to display their games to key distributors, publishers, press and investors visiting each conference.", 
      "When signing up for GDC Play, which is open to a range of emerging developers showcasing playable games, game creators will be given a standalone kiosk with a monitor, keyboard, speakers and internet connection, as applicable.", 
      "This makes the new area into a simple, lower-cost opportunity to exhibit titles to prospective business partners, investors and the press.", 
      "The Pavilions will be included within a dedicated room - including nearby seating areas for more in-depth meetings - for GDC Play, taking place on March 6th and 7th, 2012. The event will also include a special VIP reception for publishers, funders, and other notables to view the games and talk to the developers.", 
      "\"GDC Play is a great opportunity for small developers to show their games to a singularly qualified audience through an easy, low-cost entry,\" Meggan Scavio, GM of GDC events. \"And similar to the IGF Pavilion at GDC, we expect this new, playable game area to be quite the draw and catalyst for business.\"", 
      "Blow's cerebral talk will also seek to explain how \"we use games as \ninstruments, like telescopes or electron microscopes, to observe aspects\n of the universe that we would not normally have access to.\"", 
      "Using examples from a number of contemporary titles, de Fondaumiere \nwill explain \"how these restrictions are hurting our businesses and why \ngame developers must now take a leading role in changing these to \nprotect their creations.\"", 
      "GDC Europe organizers would also like to remind potential attendees \nthat Early Registration pricing for the show will end on Wednesday, July\n 20th, with reduced-price registration for the event only available \nuntil that date.", 
      "The following free video lectures, newly available, are highlights from GDC's Independent Game Summits from 2010 and 2011.", 
      "What are some of the advantages of automated MMO testing?", 
      "Most MMOs are very large projects with numerous interacting game \nsystems, and it is simply infeasible to have manual testers constantly \ntesting every nook and cranny of the game. Automated tests allow \ndevelopers to get wide test coverage before they even check in their \nchanges and they can be run on a changelist-by-changelist basis so that \nnarrowing down bugs is trivial.", 
      "At what point did CCP realize that automated testing was necessary? What were the driving actors behind the decision?", 
      "What sort of blind spots does automated testing tend to have? Are \nthere any specific things that are hard to test with an automated \nsystem?", 
      "Subjective tests are obviously difficult to automate. Whether a \ntexture is rendering or a UI element is correctly aligned isn't worth \nthe effort to test. If you're familiar with the Model-View-Controller \npattern, you want to test the interaction between the controller and the\n model; the view should be verified by your testers. For MMOs \nspecifically, there's definitely a line not worth crossing in terms of \nhow much testing should be automated. For instance, the emergent \nbehavior that we witness in our games when large groups of players \ninteract is often hard to predict and anticipate.", 
      "What is the biggest challenge developers face when writing an automated test for an MMO?", 
      "There are so many systems that need to be tested in an MMO, so a \nframework that makes it easy to write these tests is a must or \nprogrammers just won't have the time or motivation to do them.  Also, \nbecause MMOs are distributed systems, you need to be able to write tests\n that can handle the vagaries of asynchronous communication between \nmultiple, independent processes in a robust, repeatable manner.", 
      "How will your GDC Europe talk address automated testing in MMOs, and what do you expect people to take away from it?",

      "Zunächst ist strategisches Kalkül gefragt: Es gilt, die bestmögliche Kombination dreier Charaktere für das Abenteuer auszuwählen. Ob Mensch, Elf, Zwerg, Oger oder Mischform, jede Rasse hat eigene Stärken und natürlich auch Schwächen. Hat man sich entschieden, darf durch ein paar Parameter wie der Häufigkeit des Auftretens von Pilzen, Früchten, Items und Gegnern noch die Weltengeneration – und damit der Schwierigkeitsgrad – beeinflusst werden.", 
      "Anschließend geht es auch schon direkt in die neue Welt. Ein erstes Austesten der Bedienung macht deutlich: Das Spiel macht einen aufgeräumten Eindruck. Per Pfeiltasten blendet man die wenigen notwendigen Menüs ein (Inventar, Zauber und Optionen), Befehle gibt man direkt per Mausklick. Sehr schnell wird man erste Pilze auf dem Waldboden ausmachen, die es zu sammeln gilt, denn mit ihrer Hilfe lassen sich Zauber für anstehende Gefechte vorbereiten (quasi die “Munition”). Früchte lassen sich wiederum zur Heilung des Heldentrios verwenden.", 
      "Der interessanteste Teil des Spiels dürften aber zweifellos die taktischen Kämpfe sein. Sobald Feinde in der Nähe sind, wird abwechselnd gezogen und es gilt die Situation zu beurteilen. Den Charakteren stehen neben den Zaubern – so sie welche beherrschen – diverse Spezialangriffe zur Verfügung, die allerdings den aktuellen Zug sofort beenden und keine weitere Bewegungsmöglichkeit lassen. Manchmal ist es daher durchaus sinnvoller, nur einen normalen Angriff zu landen und anschließend zurückzuweichen, um wiederum dem Feind in seinem Zug die Möglichkeit eines solchen “Special-Moves” zu rauben. Darüber hinaus spielt auch das Terrain eine wichtige Rolle: Angriffe von höher gelegenen Positionen erhalten Boni, hiner Bäumen und Steinen kann sich verschanzt werden. Einen weiteren taktischen Kniff erhält das Spiel durch das Zaubersystem. Wie erwähnt kann nur eine begrenzte Zahl Zauber vorbereitet werden und es gilt überlegte Entscheidungen zu treffen, welcher Gegner direkt mit Blitzen attackiert, welche Feindesgruppe mit flächendeckenden Zaubern dezimiert und welcher übermächig scheinende Widersacher zur Vorbereitung der vorläufigen Flucht geblendet werden soll.", 
      "Daneben gibt es in der zufallsgenerierten Welt vor allem einige Schatzkisten zu entdecken, die stets mächtige Artefakte zur Verbesserung der Fähigkeiten oder zum Erlernen neuer Zauber enthalten. Auch einige NPCs, Gebäude und Dörfer sind bereits integriert, haben bislang (größtenteils) allerdings lediglich atmosphärischen (und natürlich im Kampf eventuell auch taktischen) Nutzen. Für die Zukunft ist eine große dynamische Welt mit Zufallsquests und immer neuen Herausforderungen angedacht, worüber der Entwickler auch seit einiger Zeit in seinem Blog philosophiert. Alles in allem macht Mysterious Castle aber bereits jetzt dank zugänglichem Interface, klarer Ideenumsetzung, hochspannenden Gefechten und schlicht seiner Einzigartigkeit im Roguelike-Umfeld einen sehr guten Eindruck."

There are subraces such as  high elves, deep elves, grey elves, deep elves, sludge elves (I can only  think ewww when I first saw that one), hill dwarves, mountain dwarves  and hill orcs. Unusual ones such as kobolds, mummies, ghouls, ogres and  their subrace ogre mages, trolls, draconians, centaurs, demigods,  spriggans, minotaurs, demonspawn, Kenku (violent bird-people) and  merfolk.", 
      "Each race comes with advantages and disadvantages such as a troll  will regenerate very quickly, but learn very slowly and need a large  amount of food to survive.", 
      "On top of that you have 29 different  classes which include everything from fighters, thieves and wizards all  the way to summoners, venom mages, warpers, necromancers, reavers and  crusaders. The combination of characters you can make with the races and  classes are almost endless. At the very least it offers a unique game  experience every time you choose a different race and class.", 
      "Not all races can become any class they want such. For example: If  you choose a human you can start as any class, but choose a draconian  and your choices are cut in half. You’ll need to select the race to see  just how many classes are available to them. There goes my idea of  playing a mummy crusader. I say let the undead stereotypes fall by the  wayside. I want my mummy crusader of light and goodness.",

I’ll jump right into a  game with my Draconian Necromancer, play a level or two, die and start  all over again. The ease in character creation and mouse driven  interface makes this game almost idiot proof. It took me all of 5  minutes to learn basically all the controls I needed to play.",

If your characters start with the  philosophies of Logos and Chronos then you may have a tougher time in  the begging due to their non-combative spells.

Each time you level up you are given a  choice as to what skills you want to improve. Obviously the higher the  skill the better you are at it, but there are also some unlocks.

You’ll fine your first question mark as  soon as you start a new character. As you are walking out of your cell  you will come across a question mark which tells you a little bit about  how you got into that cell and about your captors.

Later levels introduce obstacles that add an extra depth, including areas in which blocks cannot be shifted, and levels where sliding all the blocks into their holes reveals the exit.", 
      "There's also a challenge mode, which asks you to play through each of the main campaign's levels but only do a set number of shifts. Give this a download, it's lovely stuff.", 
      "There are five areas to explore in total, with additional challenges presented in the form of coins that you can choose to collect or ignore.", 
      "Only a maximum of three nails can be had on the screen as steps, so if a fourth nail is impaled on a wall then the first nail will disappear as well. This leads to some interesting switch puzzles later, since a switch will only be on when a nail is still stuck to it.", 
      "Both the protagonist's health and his weapons can be upgraded in small increments, provided that you manage to locate the special items required to level up their stats. The controls might feel clunky and unresponsive at first, but if you give the game a chance to impress it could even suprise you with its high production values in just about every other area.",

You're never given enough ammo or explosives to win the level, but fortunately there are vats of lava that will ooze about the place if you blow a hole in the side of the container. It's really tricky stuff, but once you get past the awkward controls there is plenty to like here.",

Players have to learn how to execute dash, wall jumps, reverse jumps, glide, body surf, and more if they plan to make it further into the enemy's fortress.",

It doesn't complicate things unnecessarily, and there's even a generous continue option that allows you retry a stage as many times as you want (at the cost of a hundred points minused from your score). Gamepads are also supported and can be configured from the main menu screen.", 
      "Our hero can jump, cling to the edge of a platform, or use his teleportation ability to switch between the two rooms in every stage. A trap could appear in one room and not the other, so you would need to alternate between both of them regularly in order to beat a level.",

You'll want to open any treasure chests that you find as well, since some of them carry life capsules or huge coin bonuses.",

Jean does not carry a weapon nor will he acquire one during his adventure, and the cursor keys are the only controls you ever need to use in this game from start to end.", 
      "Besides the items that you carry in your inventory, you can also trade orange berries with shady merchants for more equipment to use. Purple berries bestow the power to double jump, but try not to consume too much or you'll have a rather upset stomach to contend with.", 
      "You can use a fireplace to save your game, but to do so you'd have to keep it lit with more firewood from the forest. There are quite a few safehouses to find in the wilderness, and many of them have their own individual fireplaces that you can utilize as checkpoint locations. Standing next to a fireplace also restores any stamina lost through constant exposure to bad weather conditions or injuries.",

      "What is a 'cult game' these days? The word is often used to describe 'niche' titles, but now that smaller JRPGs and scrolling shooters have found the right price point and a dedicated Western following, that description seems lacking.", 
      "Nowadays, I think wit's more appropriate to borrow from the movies, and define cult games in a similar way. The \"B\" games that have some very interesting ideas, don't necessarily sell like gangbusters, but which come up again and again in editors' \"best-of\" lists, and which academics and theorists talk about for years to come.", 
      "These are the games that tried something interesting, and perhaps because of it didn't find a huge mainstream audience. But they did find some dedicated fans, who are eager to see what will come next from these unique minds. It's the idea of an \"auteur\" game made within a traditional structure (indie games are nearly always this way now).", 
      "Here I present to you my picks for the five best cult games from 2010:", 
      "Ian Bogost's social game development experiment has been well-documented, but it's worth a brief recap. Bogost was amazed and amused by the proliferation of social games, but also alarmed by their lack of \"game-ness\" and interactivity. So to satirize both the content and typical themes of these games, he created a game where all you do is click a cow with a time-down on it until you can click again. Various in-came items can be purchased with \"mooney\" that you earn, mimicking the microtransaction system most social games carry.", 
      "Being an academic, all sorts of lessons were learned about the nature of fun and the power of satire - but at the end of the day, you're still just clicking a cow. But really, who can blame you?", 
      "If anything adds up to a cult game, that's it. There's something to love or hate for everyone, but once you've learned about it, you can't simply ignore it. The game attracts and repels equally, making bold steps forward for games, while keeping the other foot squarely in the era of the PlayStation 2.", 
      "For those who haven't experienced it, give the first 20 minutes a whirl. The game has you leveling up insanely quickly, becoming superpowerful within moments, lending a triumphant feeling just as the story wants you to despair. Then it takes it all away and makes you hunt sheep, plant fields, and gather eggs before you can get back to the magic. The workings of a madman, indeed.", 
      "The game has clumsy combat, PS2-level graphics, and maddeningly long sequences of driving from nowhere to another, slightly differently textured nowhere. But lift the curtain a bit, and you see a living, bizarre game world, where people go about their daily business regardless of player interaction. You'll see a deeply bizarre story, with the main character (expertly voiced by Jeff Kramer) discussing necrophilia, drinking urine from skulls, and B-movie film errata in alternate breaths.", 
      "The game's dialog is so perfectly imperfectly written that it feels as though it belongs in a category all its own. It also has one of the most intelligent narrative framing devices, allowing the main character's multiple personality to take life in a way that other games have certainly attempted, but never succeeded (if I say more, I feel I may spoil something).", 
      "Once you get past the clunkiness of it, even the combat can become fun - but perhaps I have an odd perspective as someone who obtained every secret card, every weapon, and every automobile in the game. Subsequent fights through the game's \"dungeons\" turn into speed runs once you get some all-powerful weapons, that allow you to revisit frustrating areas and simply mow through enemies and pick up collectibles that are laid out for you as though they were on a racetrack.", 
      "This week on 'Best Of Indie Games', we take a look at some of the top independent PC Flash/downloadable titles released over this last week.", 
      "The goodies in this edition include a browser game inspired by old Game Boy titles, a survival roguelike game, a top-down space shooter with both single and multiplayer modes, and a game where you'd get only one chance to save the human race.", 
      "Here's the highlights from the last seven days:", 
      "It's been an odd year for the console digital download space -- lots of promotions, a ton of new titles, but honestly I felt underwhelmed overall. Developers attempted to go a little further and in the end fell a little flat.", 
      "Publishers are finally attempting something with the digital realm -- THQ, EA, Ubisoft and Atari have all tried to be a part of games made by independent developers.", 
      "Doesn't mean that there weren't any quality games around, though -- we've collected the top 5 games available for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, WiiWare, DSiWare and on PlayStation Minis, based on our own playing experience:", 
      "The campaign was a blast, and the different factions, from cats to zombies to robots, were all a great way to make a visually dull board game into something a little more unique.", 
      "The game is devious, masochistic, controller breakingly difficult and yet still intensely fun to play. And it's jam-packed with content, from the numerous levels to all the bandages you have to collect to all the secret warp zones and the always updating free level packs; I've yet to get bored with it.", 
      "Classes like Snipers, Support, and Tanks each have their own unique way through the level, and each can take down the other. Overall, fantastic work by Uber Entertainment, especially as its first independent title.", 
      "Honorable Mentions", 
      "\"It's not immediately obvious, but when you come out of the Animus and are given the opportunity to explore the safe house (or safe cave, whatever), Future Desmond has a little laptop set up for him, which he can use to read the email correspondence between the other three members of the Assassin Scooby Gang. Though largely mundane, the exchanges between the characters, the businesslike scheduling, the pranks, the snarks, the enquiries after lost yogurts and iPods, gave them a great deal of humanity.\"", 
      "\"After nearly 70 hrs of game play I never really cared about my character. I didnât really care about her father. For that matter, I didnât really care much about any of the characters in the game. Instead, I was enthralled with playing the game as a kind of future archeologist, excavating our present through traces left on these terminals and strewn about the physical landscape.\"", 
      "In between stages and Abominable Snowman battles, you'll fight gingerbread mean, Santa's elves, reindeer, and more, all with chiptune arrangements of holiday songs playing in the background.", 
      "\"Our games are perfectly suited for Kindle,\" says Choice of Games co-founder Dan Fabulich.  \"Building our games entirely with text gives us the freedom to tell sophisticated stories that put you and your choices at the center of the action.  Our games are like 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books, but bigger, deeper, and richer.\"", 
      "NOTE: Because Poppyâs art is so charming, Mister Raroo decided to eschew his usual drawings and let the screenshots stand on their own.]", 
      "Off the Charts", 
      "A year ago at Christmas my dad surprised me with a gift I didnât think I wanted: an iPod Touch. Since that day, my iPod Touch and I have been inseparable. I didnât think Iâd have any interest in iOS games, but as it turns out, the iPod Touch was my most-played platform for video games this past year. There may be an overabundance of games and applications available to consumers, but many of the best releases seem to have a tendency to float to the top.", 
      "I recently got in touch with Poppy and was delighted to find the response was just as I would have expected judging by their works. That is, the message was friendly, to the point, and contained all the information I needed. It made me smile.", 
      "All of Poppyâs iOS releases are well worth checking out, and you can purchase their entire catalog for less than the price of one Nintendo DS game. And, should you be a total cheapskate, some of Poppyâs releases are even free, so you have no excuse not to give them a chance. Below are some thoughts on my five favorite Poppy releases.", 
      "Essentially, this free application provides you with a rudimentary paint program so you can create a drawing of a smiling face and upload it for sharing with the rest of the world. The submitted smiles can be viewed randomly as ultra-happy music plays in the background.", 
      "There exists a man named Mr. Hot Dog. He wears a suit, dons a top hat, and carries a cane. Mr. Hot Dog enjoys standing at the end of a refreshment stand counter, eating hot dogs one after another. But there is one thing Mr. Hot Dog cannot stand: Mustard. Donât dare feed him a hot dog with mustard on it or you will see him make an angry face as he yells how much he hates that vile yellow condiment!", 
      "Fun fact: There was a stretch of time when my son would exclaim \"Don't want mustard!\" in regard to any food he was served due to the influence of this game.", 
      "The definition of a \"PC game\" continued to become cloudier in 2010. Is it a \"triple-A\" PC-exclusive? Are indie games included? Is it browser-based games? Cloud-based games? Social network gaming? Free-to-play?", 
      "The beautiful thing about PC gaming is that the answer to everything is a resounding \"yes.\" Just about anything can happen on the ubiquitous and open PC. The only limit is developers' ingenuity and imagination.", 
      "There's no certification with the platform holder as there is with a console -- the power is solely in the hands of the developer, and that remains PC gaming's biggest advantage.", 
      "Don't let the RPG-derived questing framework fool you; there's no experience points or leveling. The only way you'll survive mutant attacks in the irradiated Zone surrounding the devastated Chernobyl nuclear power plant is to find the right tools and meet the right people, not by grinding.", 
      "It's not just the creatures, but the castle itself that has the ability to petrify players, with immersive, eerie sounds and environments that, even with no enemies in sight, often bear down so hard on players that they have to step back and collect their own sanity to remind themselves that this is only a game.", 
      "There are some legitimate complaints about the game: the battle system, while improved, could still do with more interesting inter-character combo attacks, the side roads of a branching storyline ultimately merge back into a largely linear interstate, and, well, there was the planet scanning (which wasn't quite as tedious with a mouse as opposed to a controller).", 
      "South Korean developer Gamevil has brought its popular one-button mobile game series NOM to the iPhone with a new rotating action release that takes players through \"six eras covering billions of years\" while trying to save the hero's girlfriend.", 
      "While travelling through time and enjoying's the game's bizarre storyline/presentation, gamers will be able to equip relics to improve NOM's health/luck/\"miracle status\" and eat snacks that initiate special effects.", 
      "Washington D.C's annual four-day Music And Gaming Festival (MAGFest) will return next month with a chiptune showcase featuring Cheap Dinosaurs and \"rising star dance party duo\" George & Jonathan, with Don \"No Carrier\" Miller and Alex \"Enso\" Bond providing live visuals.", 
      "Other notable micromusic acts slated to perform at the festival include Noisewaves, Wizwars, Zen Albatross, Note!, Danimal Cannon (of Metroid Metal/Armcannon), and Inverse Phase. Zen Albatross will also lead a panel on chip music history and culture at the event.", 
      "First, the video is primarily on VHS tapes. Remember VHS tapes? They're nowhere near as popular anymore, and especially not for the kind of thing you connect to a computer and have it \"just work\".", 
      "There's also issues with getting the right video framing, the best method of recording, and also the whole \"turning it into a digitized file\" thing. It was, in other words, an excellent way to spend an entire Sunday.", 
      "Here's thumbnails of some of the showcased titles:", 
      "Incidentally, even my relative difficulty in transferring video via USB is a a dream compared to what must have been involved in getting all these different games recorded onto videotape, 11 years ago. One indicator is how the black border is all different sizes, based on the game - some end up right to the edge, while others are significantly smaller.", 
      "This port will feature the same six levels and 35 strange enemies (e.g. \"anti-air cows, exploding foxes, ninja squirrels\"), as well as the eight weapon power-ups that have the hamster hero, Newton, inhaling and spitting out sunflower seeds, beer, and and other unlikely projectiles.", 
      "The contributions will be split up among the first and second Humble Indie Bundle game developers, digital rights advocacy non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation, children's charity Child's Play, and Humble Indie Bundle's organizers.", 
      "The film was shot at Namco Bandai's Tokyo offices in March 2010, months before Takahashi left the publisher to form his own company, Uvula, where he now works with his composer wife on producing music, video games, and other projects as a freelancer.", 
      "Do you go easy on your friends? How about your partner? Or your kids?", 
      "Or do you instead compete with the fullest of your abilities?", 
      "My friends have never gone easy on me. I have friends that like to play cheap and friends that like to play fair, but I donât have friends that play with mercy. After an afternoon of death, I will come to hate them, but theyâre playing the right way. Mercy is dishonesty, a sycophantic plays tyle, and gamers only get better at games with practice. Still, I gave up on more than one game because my friends were too good at it for me to have fun.", 
      "If it hadnât been for the frog we would have been great; Rachel is elusive, but Noel is powerful. The matchup forces each player to work harder at staying in good position; Rachel out of reach, Noel in her face. The the floaty annoyance of Rachel and her condescending voice is balanced by the satisfaction of thrashing her with point-blank bullets.", 
      "When my girlfriend picked up the controller, it was the first fighting game she ever played. She played PC RPGs like Baldurâs Gate growing up; I had a console and played a little bit of everything. Fighting games run on an enormous library of assumed knowledge, passed down from fighting games since the dawn of Street Fighter.", 
      "Of course she picked up the basics in no time, but imagine how impossible it would be to learn the basics while playing against someone serious. That is an important thing to know: many moves I do perfectly under normal circumstances I choke on in real matches. But if I hadn't learned the moves first, I'd be dying to fast to even learn how to play in the first place.", 
      "It is possible for well made games to fail simply because they don't teach players correctly. Examples of this range from RPGs with inaccurate ability descriptions to ambiguously shaped hitboxes in fighting games. A game has to be challenging enough to keep a player's interest but not so hard that they are defeated before they can learn anything new. The ideal game is one that plays like a human of a similar level of skill.", 
      "And so in my matches against my girlfriend, I found myself trying to play game designer. I relented from pressure. Getting caught in a combo isnât very fun, because the whole point of the combo is to keep attacking without the opponent being able to do anything. The caught player feels bored, frustrated, and helpless. This might last for a few seconds at most, but in a fighting game thatâs a very long stretch of time, enough to feel like an eternity. Each round held more opportunities to learn than if she died right away.", 
      "I also tried not to create impossible situations, merely difficult ones. Fighting games are similar to tennis in that the way you tend to win is by forcing the opponent to make a mistake. Rachel is particularly adept at this. She's considered a zoning character, which means that she's able to control the space of the 2D levels by filling them with projectiles. The way a good single-player would teach how to deal with her is by starting off with one attack and then gradually adding more and combining them with others, so that's what I tried to doâand subsequently failed at.", 
      "It happened so often that my girlfriend panicked whenever she saw the frog: sheâd  suddenly jump backwards right into it, or stop in the middle of an attack to move away  and not have enough time to recover. The frog is tricky to deal with, but because she had to deal with the frog and everything else at the same time, and she never figured out how to deal with it because made it impossible for her.", 
      "I hope that the lesson learned here is not how to make your girlfriend want to beat you with her controller. Itâs that itâs just as possible to teach a player to play badly as it is to teach them to play well.  Single player games have the burden of teaching players every step of the way, but pre-programmed opponents only have so many tricks. How do you teach a player how to deal with a constantly learning and adapting opponent?", 
      "In fact, predictable or utterly random computer opponents teach worse playing skills. Since they don't learn, the same technique that defeated them once can be used for the rest of the game. A human, on the other hand, will learn quickly to stop behaving foolishly.", 
      "Blazblue itself is an offender in this regard, since it teaches the basics of the game but no practical skills and its computer opponents are laughable on even the highest difficulty. There is a whole wealth of skills in online games now, from frame data memorization in fighters to micromanagement in games like Starcraft, that learning about the deepest parts of the game might only be possible in nebulous forums or word of mouth.", 
      "With the Internet age, designers are making more of an effort to involve themselves with the community of gamers they're creating. Blazblue makes a valiant effort, and Starcraft II has challenge maps meant to teach unit utility and micro skills. That these skill exist is a wonder of the video game community, but the difficulty of introducing them to new players is a real one.", 
      "Valveâs DOTA II promises a system for players to act like coachesâsomething that Metal Gear Online attempted once upon a time. As games are increasingly played like sports, it only makes sense that theyâre taught like them. Is it possible, though, for games to teach skills that are applicable against humans?", 
      "If you're in need of an adventure game series to keep you company during the holiday week, independent developer and publisher Wadjet Eye has discounted its Blackwell Trilogy, offering all three of the \"atmospheric mystery games\" -- The Blackwell Legacy, Blackwell Unbound, and The Blackwell Convergence -- for $9.99 (down from its usual $$24.99 price)", 
      "According to Semi Secret's Adam \"Atomic\" Saltsman, the sale is off to a \"pretty great start,\" and the developers might have \"some special announcements\" if they raise enough money today.", 
      "The Summit is intended to \"share ideas, introduce best practices and discuss the future of gaming on established and emerging smartphone and related platforms, including the iPhone and iPad, Android OS phones and tablets, Blackberry and a cornucopia of similar handheld devices.\"", 
      "Along the way, \"concrete lessons about Android software design, compatibility across a wide range of devices, phone-oriented game design, and negotiating Android Market will be presented\", as well as details on an automated player metrics system for post-release game tuning.", 
      "Of course, we'll make sure to share any standout pieces from the \"Multiplayer\" show as they pop up online, as well as links to buy them eventually!", 
      "Once again, the game challenges players to re-create puzzle \"blueprints\" by drawing/mixing lines made up of three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue). This release offers over 80 puzzles across three difficulty modes, achievements/leaderboards via Game Center, and the ability to create your own puzzles with the iPhone or iPod Touch camera.", 
      "Every culture has its ways of putting one another to death. Some are more humane than others, but no execution technique is quite as horrifying as the crucifixion.", 
      "While most cultures today tend to attempt a âhumaneâ death for those who are deemed to deserve such a penalty, the crucifixion was inflicted on criminals particularly because it was inhumane.", 
      "It was known, not just for its incredibly painful and slow nature, but also because of the amount of shame the act brought onto the barely clothed recipient of such a death. Itâs this highly-unpleasant cultural practice that Christianity maintains as the centerpiece of its religion. And now, this practice is a primary factor in two recent blockbuster video games.", 
      "Fallout: New Vegas", 
      "In Fallout: New Vegas, the relevant encounter comes along early in the game, just as we are beginning to discover the nature of the world. In fact, the crucifixions in New Vegas serve primarily as an indication as to just how totalitarian and excessively cruel Caesarâs legion is as a faction. Until that moment, the various factions in New Vegas seem pedestrian. That all changes when the player makes their way toward that billowing pillar of smoke in the city of Nipton.", 
      "Immediately, the members of Caesarâs Legion make their case for such cruel treatment, and their case is primarily a moral one. They claim that those who have been killed or crucified had it coming. In fact, they seek to use the residents of Nipton as a sort of âobject lessonâ because of the âdegenerateâ nature of the population.", 
      "Because the town was made up of thieves and prostitutes, Caesarâs Legion saw it as perfectly reasonable to make an example of them. Ultimately, though, it becomes clear that Caesarâs Legion arenât interested in justice. The real motivation for the crucifixions is to strike fear in the hearts of the surrounding factions. They had the desire to conquer, not to maintain social equity.", 
      "And really, this is the typical use for crucifixion: fear-mongering. The act lends itself naturally to public display, and doesnât really make sense as an efficient form of execution. In Fallout: New Vegas, the player has the chance to experience something unique to both the modern world and the various video games we play: the intentional, shameless display of pure, methodical human cruelty. Even if the cruelty is carried out against criminals, the modern world looks down on their âinhumaneâ treatment.", 
      "Typical video game enemies donât shy away from such treatment, but they do seem to be either too hurried or lazy to go to the trouble of actual inhumane treatment. After all, the crucifixion takes a lot of deliberate work, and is always premeditated.", 
      "You need a specific type of equipment, and you need to be knowledgeable of the proper technique. Hammer the nails into the wrong place, and gravity will simply allow the nails to rip right through, letting the body fall to the ground. It takes several men to not only hold the convicted man to the cross, but to lift it as well.", 
      "The interactions we are allowed with those on the cross may seem overly limited at first, but they manage to instill in the observer the perfect reaction to such a circumstance. When we try to interact with those on the crosses, we are told that to attempt to take them down would only prolong their suffering. You donât have a lot of choices. In a game thatâs characterized by constant choice, this lack of agency actually instills in us an accurate amount of helplessness and horror.", 
      "Assassinâs Creed: Brotherhood", 
      "The crucifixion in Assassinâs Creed: Brotherhood is framed in an entirely different light. The first, most noteworthy difference is that it is, in fact, not a real crucifixion at all. Instead, itâs merely a part of a passion play, wherein actors reenact the most famous crucifixion of all: the death of Jesus Christ.", 
      "In this case, the part of Jesus Christ is played by Pietro Rossi, a prominent actor and, incidentally, the target of an assassination by Micheletto. Itâs this secondary designation that actually drives the narrative of this scene which, in fact, doesnât have much interest in the crucifixion at all.", 
      "In general, Assassinâs Creed: Brotherhood manages to let its predecessor speak for it in regard to its thoughts about organized religion and the âmythâ of Jesus Christ. In doing so, it avoids the dreaded fault of preachiness, and the story is vastly improved as a result.", 
      "Rather than presenting us with dialogue that sounds remarkably like propaganda (as was often the case in AC2), the game manages to remain relatively subtle throughout, even when the the circumstance seems to cry out for some sort of blatant acknowledgement of the religious surroundings. After all, what begs for comment more than Jesus himself on the cross?", 
      "Itâs to the credit of the writers that they refrained from anything more than the story requires, and trusted the reader to make their own inferences, whether consciously or not. Of course, this isnât to say that an editorial hand wasnât at work. In fact, itâs the framing of this circumstance that sets up the entire theme of the Assassinâs Creed series.", 
      "In this scene, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and the central event of Christianity is portrayed as merely an act, carried out for the benefit of the privileged. Meanwhile, oblivious to those involved in the act, the real struggle for mankind is taking place all around.", 
      "As the words of Jesus Christ are spoken (and if you have subtitles turned on, theyâre displayed on the bottom on the screen), Ezio glides and crawls through the Colosseum, seeking to accomplish actual change. Quite literally, there is a false struggle featuring a weak, oblivious man, and there is a true struggle with real stakes featuring our protagonist. The scene is so carefully and evenhandedly carried out, that the moment the man playing Jesus asks Ezio who he is seems earned and powerful. Ezio replies: âIâm your saviorâ.", 
      "Grappling With the Spectacle", 
      "Both the Assassinâs Creed and Fallout series are known for providing the player with an opportunity to explore actual locations in a way that they would be unable to do otherwise. By placing us in existing environments under unique circumstances they allow for an experience that not only entertains and surprises us, but challenges us with iconography that we often only have a distant or abstract relationship with.", 
      "As someone who considers Jesusâ death on the cross to be a foundational part of my beliefs and outlook, to be confronted with a concrete representation of that killing device in a digital space was at once surreal, shocking, instructive, and inspiring.", 
      "In Fallout: New Vegas, the crucifixions felt scandalous in their prevalence. Much like overusing an exclamation mark eventually renders the punctuation meaningless, to kill almost all citizens of Nipton in such a way made crucifixion seem rote and pointless.", 
      "Still, I found myself wandering up to these individuals one at a time and feeling sympathy for them. I lingered on every one, observed his garments, speculated about his place in his faction, and tried, every time, to take them down from the cross. I looked around for those who might care for these individuals and only found those who care about themselves.", 
      "Meanwhile, in Assassinâs Creed: Brotherhood, as I slowly made my way across the Colosseum I heard Jesusâ words spoken out loud, and read the subtitles on the bottom of the screen. I took a moment to think about what was truly being represented in that play: a man attempting to save the world by dying. And then, I took action myself. I killed those who stood in my way, one by one. By way of force, I executed the plan, and yet the plan faltered.", 
      "Unlike in Fallout: New Vegas, I was able to take this poor man down from the cross and save him from a needless death. As Ezio carried him to a doctor and declared himself the actorâs savior, the game contrasts two possible ways to save the world: the humble, unassuming death and the proud, proactive use of force.", 
      "I know of no games in which the player dies by crucifixion, and besides the inherent controversy that would follow, I think thereâs a more ludic reason: games thrive off of direct, satisfying action. They require a proactive protagonist that makes his own decisions and thinks primarily of himself in the moment.", 
      "There is simply no way that such a hero would find himself in a position to be crucified, lying, hands splayed on a cross. Even if he did, the player would likely just grow bored, restart the level, and try again.", 
      "Basically, you direct cars around an isometric neighborhood, and they play different noises as they pass tress, lamp posts, and houses. You can easily set it up so that a separated car will replay a loop to create a basic beat for your song.", 
      "Helen and Douglas House seeks to provide \"respite and end of life care for children and young adults with life-shortening conditions, as well as support and friendship for the whole family.\" Its two houses offer 15 beds and several family flats, where guests requiring hospice care can stay free of charge.", 
      "SpecialEffect worked for over a year and a half with help from the Helen and Douglas House staff and  support/funding from the game industry to create the games suite. The area features games that users can play with eye-gaze devices and switches, allowing those with physical disabilities to enjoy the interactive setups.", 
      "This suit is the result of SpecialEffect's \"A Game for Helen\" project, which was named after and inspired by a young girl named Helen who regularly visits the hospice and suffers from a rare metabolic disorder that makes it difficult for her to play games with a traditional controller.

      "This year, the Nuovo Jury discussion focused on celebrating games that not only embody a strong authorial voice, but \"open the eyes of the audience (and other developers), that provoke discussion... not for the sake of being contrary, but for the sake of expanding the form, of treading on unexplored terrain.\"", 
      "The jury also felt Nuovo finalists should make the player \"feel lost at the beginning because they've never experienced such a language before, but then should feel delight when they manage to 'understand' it, and feel eager to build on it,\" and should \"have some obscure magic that transcends analysis and picking apart of individual design choices.\"", 
      "Keeping these criteria in mind, the discussion focused on the games that were most-recommended by Main Competition judges, as well as our own picks from IGF entrants. We have decided (via online discussion and jury voting) on the following finalists for the 2011 IGF Nuovo Award, each of which will receive All-Access GDC 2011 tickets and the opportunity to exhibit their game in the conference's IGF Pavilion:", 
      "Finalists", 
      "Honorable Mentions", 
      "There were many titles that were recommended or advocated for by judges and received multiple votes in our final tally, but did not make the Finalist list due to insufficient votes. Nonetheless, we're happy to mention and recommend these titles as Nuovo 'honorable mentions', that those interested in alternative independent games should certainly check out:", 
      "All eight Nuovo finalists will exhibit their games at Game Developers Conference 2011 in San Francisco in the IGF Pavilion, and a Nuovo Award winner, alongside an increased prize of $5,000, will be revealed at the IGF Awards Ceremony on the evening of March 2, 2011.", 
      "Now in its third year, the Nuovo Award allows more esoteric art games from among the almost 400 IGF entries to compete on their own terms alongside longer-form indie titles, and has been newly expanded this year to include eight finalists.", 
      "The full list of this year's Nuovo Award finalists, with links to screenshots and videos of the titles on their official IGF.com entry pages, is as follows:", 
      "\"This year's finalists for the Nuovo Award perfectly embody what this award was created to celebrate -- a set of games that could hardly be more different from each other than they are from the wider body of entrants in this year's festival,\" said IGF chairman Brandon Boyer.", 
      "\"Running the gamut from quiet reflections on both nature and ourselves, to raucous new-arcade experiences designed to entertain onlookers as much as the participants of the game, each finalist showcases the unconventional approach of the indie community to new forms of play.\"", 
      "Speaking to a packed audience as part of his Mobile Games Summit speech during the show, Vesterbacka discussed the 8 months in development of the hit iOS and Android title, which has been downloaded more than 50 million times in free and paid versions.", 
      "The game from the veteran Scandinavian game creator was planned specifically to compete in the \"competitive, brutal marketplace\", and now the title has become a major success, name-checked by celebrities and the man in the street alike.", 
      "In fact, the title and its Halloween/Christmas spin-off hold the top two paid positions in the chart even as of press time. So how do you keep at the top?", 
      "Well, Vesterbacka pointed out that the game was not an instant success - it took 5 months to reach the top of the charts, and did so gradually.", 
      "But from there, it's been key to continue updating very regularly with new content, even though they're not charging any extra for it - and so with updates every 4 weeks and even the seasonal version, plus the timeless nature of the gameplay, Rovio has really capitalized and retained their high chart placement.", 
      "But it's the Angry Birds' franchise larger plans for the future that also concern the Rovio head, as he explained that there is a compelling backstory to the game, involving an island, pigs stealing eggs and the resultant furious avians.", 
      "With so many worthwhile releases, choosing just 10 from this year was quite the challenge. Note that for every game featured in our top 10, dozens of other must-play indie titles were left out. We genuinely feel bad about it, so we've listed just over a dozen honorable mentions at the bottom to make up for it.", 
      "Here are our picks for the top ten indie games of this year:", 
      "Just in case you've somehow managed to miss the phenomenon, Minecraft presents you with a blocky, randomly-generated world in which you can dig, build and explore, and even join friends online for a spot of multiplayer silliness. The game has got indie developers the world over scratching their heads, trying to work out what this secret formula for selling millions is. Minecraft is quite easily one of the biggest gaming success stories of the year.", 
      "Happy holidays, gentlemen and ladies! \"'Tis the season to be sharing,\" as Santa told Fred Flintstone countless times on TV throughout my childhood -- and plainly Official Xbox Magazine is in a sharing mood, because page 25 of the January 2011 issue features this wonderful, informative, uplifting article that put me in the Christmas spirit like nothing else before.", 
      "Previous issues of OXM have taught me how to excel at online Call of Duty, what games to look out for this Christmas, even how to pad my Gamerscore with the least amount of actual gameplay. Now they're going a step further and actively trying to help me with my sex life!", 
      "This in-depth feature tells the inspiring tale of John Alanis, a man intent upon imparting the secrets of a \"short, fat, dumpy guy\" who taught him how much of a \"paint-by-numbers, step-by-step, brain-dead simple process\" it is to deal with women. Such a wonderful piece of affirmation to all males everywhere! And there's a handy URL to consult for all the secrets, too!", 
      "Although the Great Magazine Die-off of 2009 appears to be over (there are actually more mags being printed in the US this year than last), advertising continues to be pretty slow in the gaming genre. I noted a couple columns ago that ESRB filler ads (which get printed for lack of actual paid advertising, sort of like public-service announcements on TV) were popping up in the Future mags a fair bit lately, but I think I may still prefer those ESRB ads over weaselly airline cabin magazine-style ads like this one. What pays the bills pays the bills, though, eh?", 
      "Regardless, let's move on to covering the mags that made it under my door in the past two weeks. It may be my last Mag Roundup of the year, so enjoy the rest of it!", 
      "Lara Croft is getting a new, grittier update, and the US Postal Service obliged by making my copy of the new GI just as scuffed-up and torn apart as the cover subject. Thanks, guys! The cover article is a \"debut preview\" in every sense of the term -- the art assets mostly serve to show off Lara's new look and the article doesn't talk much about real gameplay -- but the story behind the new game, as told in the text, is still pretty compelling.", 
      "It being January, it's maybe appropriate that the front section has its eyes fixed straight on the future. There's a roundtable profiling the job of video-game analysts like Michael Pachter, an interview with Sega's VP of sales about where the company's going in '11, some analysis about the Supreme Court game hearing, and more. Considering the mag's only 100 pages this month, I'm pleasantly surprised that the opening piece about Iran's game rating system was given a full spread -- the article's really neat, albeit a bit tantalizingly short.", 
      "In addition to helping me with my game at the college bars, this month's OXM tells readers about the top 11 games for 2011 -- a basic sort of preview feature. The features following, including a guidebook on how to make non-crap game movies and how to play Halo: Reach really, really well, are a lot more memorable.", 
      "Aiee! A game that only the most crazy-hardcore of Nintenbots will care about graces the cover -- no offense meant to NP's staff, of course; I know the pickings aren't super bountiful right now. Games like ATV Wild Ride and Captain America: Super Soldier get full-page previews inside, but the longer feature on Majesco's Monster Tale (one of those portable side-scrollers heavily influenced by old Genesis games, the sort of stuff WayForward is normally known for) is pretty remarkable for its depth and prettiness.", 
      "His style is unique and quite nice when he's drawing cars or spaceships or armored warriors or somesuch, but I'm not quite sure it works as well with \"cutesy\" subjects like this. The piece accompanying the article is pretty massive, encompassing the entire history of the developer and interviewing all sorts of dudes.", 
      "Fun fact: At 116 pages, Retro Gamer is actually the largest issue in this Mag Roundup in terms of number of pages -- and #1 in number of edit pages, too. A mite more expensive, but..."

      "My favourite weapon so far has to be the adhesive grenade launcher. This baby saved me in many a close encounter when my normal weaponry would have failed against the hordes. Alas, this glorious gun was out of ammunition as I entered level three, and I credit it to my downfall that I relied far too heavily on a weapon of choice instead of making sure I was capable of using my entire arsenal. To my shame, I died holding a rocket launcher, three bombs and a revolver that could probably have saved my life.",

My first exploding barrel. She’d shot it — chances were I wouldn’t have figured it out on my own.",

He was better at it than I was — he never made it very far, but only because he played on the second-hardest difficulty, while I was still pussyfooting around on the easier modes. He was clinical about it, counting every bullet and memorizing the position and type of every monster. He mastered strafing long before I ever did.",

I’d found a massive industrial blast door that I suspected needed its power restored, but I couldn’t figure out where the power control terminal was. Worse, I’d transformed my ordinary pistol into a rapid-firing autopistol, which turned out to be a mistake because I’d burnt through all my 9mm rounds in half as many firefights. Now I was left with a shotgun with a handful of shells and a half-empty revolver. I’d eaten all my preserved meat and drained all my medkits, leaving me with nothing but some empty cans, a couple boxes of nails, some microchips, and a motor in my backpack. Oh, and one bomb that I’d taped some nails to.", 
      "As bad as things were, they got worse when I opened the next door and two dozen skittering mutants leaped at me. I ran back into the hall, forcing them into the narrow corridor where my shotgun could do its work, but still they came. Nothing left to do, I backed up as far as I could and tossed my nailbomb.", 
      "The screen shuddered with color like an old TV’s dying tube and my speakers burst with static. When everything was still again, the dozen remaining mutants were in pieces and I was wounded.", 
      "Still, hope. The bomb had split open part of the wall — a secret! Giddy, I ran inside, and found some more potted meat, which I immediately scarfed down, and another explosive. Some 9mm rounds too, not that those would last more than two seconds. Even so, it was a good find. I took one of my empty cans, filled it with the explosive, and tamped it all in with some nails. Now I had a cangun — a single-use all-wrecking handheld tool of mass destruction. I’d be able to survive at least one more encounter.", 
      "I found the power switch nearby and went back through the heavy doors with little trouble, but on the other side I was immediately overwhelmed by an ambush from all sides. Tiny zombies scuttled out of pipes in the wall while a larger monster hurled what looked like poo, except it hurt a lot more. No problem — I’ve got a cangun. I ran around and around the room, getting everyone to follow me in a lumbering grunting sweating imitation of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, then sprinted back to the entrance. As everyone closed in for the feast, I turned, can in hand, pulled the wire sticking out the back, and",

      "The exit teleporter is in the next room. Safe.", 
      "That’s Teleglitch. And it’s not only like Doom — it’s better.", 
      "Oh, there are differences, but they’re the sort that feel just right in the context of a fast-paced survival-horror shooter. The perspective is top-down rather than first-person, though Doom basically existed on a 2D plane anyway, and this way you get to see all the fantastic lighting and line-of-sight mechanics at play. The maps are randomly generated, which can make them a bit wonky and can make the level wildly easier or harder depending on loot and monster placement, but that means you never really lose that sense of displacement, of being an intruder in a foreign and infested place, and every corner or door could have a box of munitions or a shotgun-toting lunatic behind it. Doom didn’t have a crafting system to let you turn your machinegun into a depleted-uranium driver, or illegally modify your grenade launcher to fire five of the sticky bastards, or build a motion detector so you could avoid the pipes where the smallest and most obnoxious mutants live. But it could have, because it fits right in.", 
      "The goal of the game’s three designers was to create something akin to those older shooters — its plot even feels like a tribute to Doom’s “teleportation experiment gone wrong” backstory — and they’ve succeeded. Nearly everything feels right. It’s tense and terrifying. The setting is alternately lonely and too-crowded. The plot is completely optional. The gunplay is frantic, and the outcome never certain. The visual and audial distortion that accompany combat or performance-enhancing drugs lends added punch and confusion to the combat. Even the game’s mapping system is pitch-perfect, updated as you explore and filled with nifty details like the names of various research wings and security barracks, and sometimes filled with helpful data from terminals, like the locations of loot lockers or the exit teleporter.", 
      "If I had one complaint, it would be with myself. It’s possible to skip to later levels (templates, really, since they’re randomly created with each play), but only once you’ve completed the level after it — so beating level 4 will let you start on level 3 in later plays. This means that I’ve replayed the early scenes over and over again, and because I’m no longer the same kid, with the same blinding reflexes and unwavering dedication, I suspect I’ll never get to enjoy what the later templates have to offer.",

Then I’ll miss a load of shots, use the cangun on a big mutant and die, quivering, in the corner of some overgrown garden area while a pack of diminutive zombies feast on my still-warm gizzards.

This planet was chosen for its extreme isolation as well as its extremely cheap stock price, given that it is bathed in blistering radiation and a poisonous atmosphere. As is wont to happen at military technology research bases in forsaken fringes of outer space, something has suddenly gone terribly wrong and most of the facility personnel have been brutally killed. Now the laboratories and hallways of the facility are being warped into chaotic rearrangements and stalked by robots and reanimated, microchipped corpses under the control of the facility's psychotic AI system.",

The game uses a top-down perspective with a dynamic camera that swivels as the player travels through crooked corridors and wider clearings to keep the direction of movement generally aligned with the cardinal directions of the keyboard arrow keys. Line-of-sight is simulated by blacking out all regions obscured by walls or obstacles relative to the player's current location.",

The game features a robust crafting system that allows players to create weapons, traps, and specialty items, such as motion detectors. Additionally, some weapons can be upgraded to expand their capabilities, such as adding a drum magazine to an assault rifle to increase its ammo capacity.

Computer terminals scattered about give insights into the daily operations and the dangerous experiments that were being conducted on Medusa 1-C leading up to the catastrophe.",

Each shortcut will take you to a level at least 2 lower than the farthest you've gotten to before, so the shortcut to level 3 is unlocked once you've managed to reach level 5, and the shortcut to level 5 comes once you're on level 7, and so on.

Flying through the same colourful tunnels, listening to the same sounds, with almost no gameplay at all other than avoiding obstacles and trying to run into glyphs.

      "Mattel Intellivision FAQ", 
      "Frequently Asked\r\nQuestions", 
      "Version 7.0", 
      "Maintained by David Harley", 
      "Table of Contents", 
      "At the end of 1979, Mattel Electronics (a division of Mattel\r\nToys) released a video game system known as Intellivision along with 12 video\r\ngame cartridges. Poised as a competitor to the then king of the hill Atari 2600,\r\nMattel Electronics called their new product \"Intelligent Television\",\r\nstemming largely from their marketing plans to release a compatible computer\r\nkeyboard for their video games console. Mattel's marketing was anything *but*\r\nintelligent and almost destroyed the company by 1984. In one sense the system\r\nwas very successful, with over 3 million units sold and 125 games released\r\nbefore the system was discontinued by INTV Corp. in 1990.", 
      "The original Master Component was test marketed in Fresno,\r\nCalifornia in late 1979. The response was excellent, and Mattel went national\r\nwith their new game system in late 1980. The first year's production run of\r\n200,000 units was completely sold out! To help enhance its marketability,\r\nMattel also marketed the system in Sears stores as the Super Video Arcade, and\r\nat Radio Shack as the Tandyvision One in the early 1980's.", 
      "1980 was a turbulent year for the Intellivision. Mattel\r\nannounced that an \"inexpensive\" keyboard expansion would be available\r\nin 1981 for the master component to be dropped into. This was to turn the\r\nsystem into a powerful 64K home computer that could do everything from play\r\ngames to balance your checkbook. There was a great deal of marketing money and press\r\ncoverage devoted to this unit; a third of the box for the GTE/Sylvania\r\nIntellivision describes the features of this proposed expansion. Many people\r\nbought an Intellivision with plans to turn it into a computer when the\r\nexpansion module was released. Months, then years passed. The original\r\nexpansion keyboard was released only in a few test areas in late 1981. With the\r\nprice too high and the initial reaction poor, the product was scrapped in 1982\r\nbefore being released nationwide.", 
      "1982 saw many changes in both the videogame industry and the\r\nIntellivision product line. A voice-synthesis module called Intellivoice made\r\nsound and speech and integral part of game play, through the use of special\r\nvoice-enhanced cartridges. The Intellivision II was also released this year,\r\nwhich one company spokesperson described as \"smaller and lighter that the\r\noriginal, yet with the same powerful 16-bit microprocessor\". The new\r\nconsole was more compact than the first, and its grayish body made it look more\r\nlike a sophisticated electronic device than the original design.", 
      "1983 brought more promises from the folks at Mattel, the\r\nmost significant of which being the Intellivision III. This was shown off at\r\nthe January 1983 CES show, and lauded in the videogame magazines for many months\r\nafterwards. In June of 1983 at the Summer CES show, Mattel announced it was\r\nkilling the Intellivision III and including most of its high-profile features\r\ninto their long-awaited computer expansion, the Entertainment Computer System.", 
      "Probably the most ambitious effort the Intellivision team\r\nhad undertaken, the Entertainment Computer System was comprised of a computer\r\nkeyboard add-on, a 49-key music synthesizer, ram expansion for the keyboard\r\nadd-on to expand it to a full 64K RAM and 24K ROM, a data recorder to store\r\nprograms, a 40-column thermal printer, and an adapter which would allow you to\r\nplay Atari 2600 games on your Intellivision. The RAM expansion modules never\r\nsaw the light of day. The data recorder, and thermal printer were released as\r\ncomponents for the Aquarius computer. The music synthesizer had but one\r\nsoftware title to take advantage of its capabilities. While the 2600 adapter\r\ngreatly expanded the library of available games, much of the steam this\r\ngenerated had already been stolen by Coleco's own expansion module.", 
      "1984 would spell the end of the original Intellivision as\r\nthe world knew it. Terry E. Valeski, Senior Vice President of Marketing and\r\nSales at Mattel Electronics, along with a group of investors, purchased the\r\nassets, trademarks, patents, and right to the Intellivision in January of 1984\r\nfor $16.5 million dollars. The purchase was backed by financing from Tangible\r\nIndustries, a division of Revco Drug Stores, The newly formed company was\r\noriginally called Intellivision, Inc., and later renamed INTV, Inc., after\r\nValeski negotiated all rights from Revco in November of 1984. During the next\r\ntwo years, the new company would lie dormant while plans were being made for a\r\nre-emergence.", 
      "In the fall of 1985, the INTV System III (also called the\r\nSuper Pro System) appeared at Toys 'R Us, Kiddie City, and in a mail order\r\ncatalog sent to owners of the original Intellivision direct from INTV. The new console\r\nwas of the same general design as the original master component, except it\r\nsported a fresh black plastic shell with brushed aluminum trim. Several new games\r\naccompanied the release of the new system, and 1985 would register over $6\r\nmillion dollars in sales worldwide, indicating that INTV Corp. had indeed revived\r\nthe Intellivision. INTV continued to market games and repair services through\r\nthe mail with great success. Between 1985 and 1990 over 35 new games were\r\nreleased, bringing the Intellivision's game library to a total of 125 titles.", 
      "Many more changes were to come during the final six years of\r\nIntellivision's life. In 1987, an improved master component called the INTV\r\nSystem IV was shown at the January CES, which sported detachable controllers\r\nand a timing device. Unfortunately, this never saw the light of day either. In\r\nthe fall of 1988, INTV re-introduced the computer keyboard adapter through\r\ntheir mail order catalog on a limited quantity basis. In 1990, INTV\r\ndiscontinued retail sales of their games and equipment and sold them only\r\nthrough the mail channels.", 
      "The change in marketing was due to agreements with Nintendo\r\nand Sega to become a software vendor for the NES, Game Boy and Genesis. In\r\n1991, INTV sold out its stock of Intellivision games and consoles, and the\r\ncompany, along with the Intellivision, gradually faded away.",

      "Looking AT the cartridge, not the Intellivision unit: you\r\nprobably should double-check this, but I obviously can't accept any\r\nresponsibility for any damage to your Master Component. (I'm not 100% sure\r\nabout the assignments for VCC and GND)", 
      "All *x pins are connected; cartridges have a loop on the top\r\nrow connecting them, and the connector in the Intellivision unit connects the\r\ntop row *x pins to those on the bottom row. Internally, *x pins are connected\r\nas follows:",

I suspect that they may switch the ROM from address write mode to\r\ndata read mode (like the three bus control lines on the CPU, maybe).",

      "Graphics is character based. The screen is twelve rows of\r\ntwenty characters. Characters either come from Graphics ROM (GROM), which\r\ncontains the usual alphanumeric symbols and a bunch of other things meant to be\r\nuseful in drawing backgrounds (256 characters in all), or Graphics RAM (GRAM),\r\nwhich the program can use to build pictures needed that aren't in GROM (like\r\nsprite images). GRAM can hold 64. The pre-designed sprites located in ROM were\r\na big help in speeding up game play. Eight of the colors are designated as the\r\nprimary colors. The other eight are called the pastel colors.", 
      "There were two graphics modes: Foreground/Background, and\r\nColor Stack. In F/B mode, you specify the colors for both the on and off pixels\r\nof each card (\"card\" is the term for a 8x8 block on the screen). One\r\nof these (the on pixels, I think) could use any color, but the other could only\r\nuse the primary colors.", 
      "In CS mode, you can give the chip a circular list of four\r\ncolors (pastels and primaries are both allowed). For each card, you specify the\r\nON bits color from any of the 16 colors, and the OFF bits color comes from the\r\nnext color on the circular list. You can also tell if the list is to advance or\r\nnot. Thus, in CS mode, you only get four colors for the OFF bits, and they have\r\nto be used in a predetermined order, but you get to use the pastels. Most games\r\nused CS mode.", 
      "A sprite could be designated as either being in front of or\r\nbehind the background, which determined priority when it overlapped the ON\r\npixels of a background image.", 
      "You could tell the graphics chip to black out the top row or\r\nthe first column (or both) of cards. You could also tell it to delay the\r\ndisplay by up to the time of seven scan lines, or to delay the pixels on each\r\nscan line by up to seven pixel times. Using these two features together allows\r\nfor smooth scrolling.", 
      "For example, a game that is going to scroll a lot sideways\r\ncould black out the first row. Now, to scroll the background to the right by\r\none pixel, you just have to delay by one pixel time. This moves everything\r\nover. The black part is NOT delayed --that is always displayed in the first 8\r\nscreen pixel locations. The net result is that you now see one pixel that was\r\npreviously hidden under the black strip, and one pixel on the other side has\r\nfallen of the edge, and everything appears to have moved over. Thus, to scroll,\r\nyou only have to move the screen memory every eighth time, when things need to\r\nbe shifted a full card. There is no need for a bitblt-type operation.", 
      "The hardware detected collisions between sprites and other\r\nsprites or the background.", 
      "GRAM and screen memory could only be manipulated during\r\nvertical retrace. At the end of vertical retrace, you had to tell the chip if\r\nit should display or not. If you weren't done, you could keep manipulating by\r\nnot telling it to display, but then you end up with a flicker which was unacceptable.", 
      "The operating system did several things:", 
      "It allowed the program to specify a velocity for each\r\nsprite. The OS would deal with adjusting the sprite position registers for you\r\nand cycling through your animation sequence.", 
      "For each pair of sprites you could specify a routine to be\r\ncalled when that pair of sprites collided. For each sprite, you could specify a\r\nroutine to be called when that sprite hit the background or the edge of the\r\nscreen.", 
      "It maintained timers, and allowed you to specify routines to\r\nbe called periodically.", 
      "It dealt with the controls. You could specify routines to be\r\ncalled when the control disc was pressed or released, or when buttons were\r\npressed or released. It provided functions to read numbers from the keypad. The\r\ncalling sequences for these were a bit strange. When you called these, they\r\nsaved the return address, and then did a return. You had to call them with\r\nnothing after your return address on the stack, and they return to your caller.\r\nWhen the number is ready, they return to after where you called them, but as an\r\ninterrupt. In generic assembly, it would be like this (I've long since\r\nforgotten 1600!):",

      "This unit only saw a limited test marketing run of less than\r\none thousand units in late 1981. It was color-keyed to match the INTV I, and\r\nthe entire game console fit into the top of the unit. It sported a full-stroke\r\n60-key keyboard, built in cassette recorder, and brought the total memory\r\ncapacity of the Intellivision to 64K. A modem expansion module was also\r\nplanned. Due to its high street price (around $700, versus an announced price\r\nof $150), the plans to market this unit nationally were shelved.", 
      "This module attaches to the cartridge port of your Intellivision,\r\nand through the use of special voice-enhanced games, your INTV could talk.\r\nThere were 5 games released to take advantage of the unit's capabilities (Space\r\nSpartans, B-17 Bomber, Tron Solar Sailor, Bomb Squad, and World Series Major\r\nLeague Baseball (also requires the ECS) ). The module has a dial on the front\r\nto control the voice's volume.

      "This unit comes in two flavors, the grey mentioned above,\r\nand also a dark brown color (sold in the European market) keyed to the original\r\nIntellivision. Functionally, the units are identical except for the 220 volt\r\npower supply. The dark brown variety is extremely difficult to find. Expansions\r\nannounced for this unit includes a 16K RAM, 8K ROM expansion, a 32KRAM, 12K ROM\r\nexpansion. None of these peripherals ever made it to market.", 
      "This was an add-on for the ECS, a full 49 key piano style\r\nkeyboard. It has 6 note polyphony (for you non-musicians, can play 6 notes at\r\nonce), and plugs into the controller ports on the ECS via a dual 9 pin\r\nconnector. Melody Blaster was the only program released by Mattel to\r\nspecifically take advantage of this component. This unit also came molded\r\neither in light gray or dark brown plastic (European market). Although they are\r\nboth pretty tough to find, the brown variety is extremely rare.", 
      "The Atari 2600 had the biggest library of games at the time,\r\nand Mattel added the capability of playing 2600 carts to the INTV II with this\r\nmodule. This unit also interfaces with the INTV II via the cartridge port. It\r\nhas a 2600 cartridge port on the top of the module, Game Select and Reset keys\r\nflanking the two difficulty and color/BW switch. The controller ports are\r\nlocated on the front of the module, and any of your favorite 2600 compatible\r\ncontrollers work just fine. If you don't happen to have Atari controllers lying\r\naround, you can use the disc controller attached to the INTV II in lieu of\r\nthem. If you happened to own an original Intellivision, sending in your Master\r\nComponent and $19.95 would get you a main board modification that was required\r\nfor this unit to work with the older equipment.",

      "Tired of switching between your 8 favorite games? Get a\r\nVideoplexer! Similar to the RomScanner for the Atari 2600, this unit would\r\nstore 8 Intellivision games and allow you to switch them on the fly via a touch\r\npanel on the front of the unit. The unit plugs into the cartridge port of the\r\nbase system, and on top there are slots for up to eight cartridges. At the base\r\nof the Videoplexer, there are 8 buttons for switching between the cartridges.", 
      "The idea of beaming videogames through Cable TV is not new;\r\na company called PlayCable created an adapter for the Intellivision that\r\nplugged in to the cartridge port, and the service had a selection of 20 of the\r\nmost popular games available every month.", 
      "Steven Roode and his brother were fortunate enough to have\r\nthis service, and what follows is his description of the hardware and the\r\nservice provided:", 
      "When you signed up for PlayCable, you were given a box\r\nwhich would plug into the Intellivision's (INTV's) cartridge port. The box had\r\nthe same color scheme as an INTV I, and its dimensions were the same height and\r\ndepth of the INTV I, with the length of an INTV II. It had a power cord coming\r\nout of it. Additionally, you were given a RF box which had a coaxial in, a\r\ncoaxial out, and two RCA outs. One RCA out was connected to the INTV, and one\r\nwas connected to the PlayCable unit.", 
      "For about $4.95 a month, the cable company would transmit 20\r\ngames (Although for the first few months, there were only 15 games). When you\r\nturned on the INTV, a sort of 'boot screen' would come up and you would hear a\r\nsound that sort of sounded like a clock ticking. After a couple of seconds, you\r\nwould hear 4 long beeps and the PlayCable title screen would pop up. There\r\nwould be one of four different songs in the background (I know that one was the\r\nvictory song in checkers, one was The Entertainer, one was Music Box Dancer,\r\nand I forget the other one). Each screen listed 5 games (I think, it may have\r\nbeen 4), and you could cycle through the games lists by pressing the disc. When\r\nyou found the game that you wanted, you would press the number next to it, and\r\npress enter. A title screen of the game would pop up, and again you would hear\r\nticking. After a couple of seconds, you would hear the same 4 long beeps and\r\nthe game would be ready to play",

      "HOW TO SELECT YOUR FAVORITE GAME FROM PLAYCABLE:",

      "- Turn on your television and turn to Channel 3 or 4. (The\r\nsame setting as the switch on the bottom of the Mattel Electronics Master\r\nComponent.)", 
      "- Turn on the Master Component; push the RESET button.", 
      "- The screen will read, \"PLAYCABLE CATALOG.\" The\r\nscreen will then change to: \"PLAYCABLE PRESENTS INTELLIVISION. PUSH\r\nDISC.\"",

      "One of the neater aspects of PlayCable was that they would\r\nrotate out about half of the games every month. When they did, you would get\r\ninstruction books and overlays for each new game in the mail (and all of the\r\noverlays were attached with perforations; so you would have to sort of tear\r\nthem apart).", 
      "PlayCable tended to have some pretty decent games on it. You\r\nwould always have a couple of the 'classics' every month (i.e., I don't think\r\nBaseball and Astrosmash ever came off!), and you would get some pretty recent\r\ngames as well. Once in a while they were slow in changing the games. They were\r\nsupposed to be rotated out on the 1st of each month. Believe me, my brother and\r\nI would fake sick to stay home from school sometimes on the 1st! If by noon\r\nthey weren't changed, we would call the cable company and by the end of the day\r\nthey were updated (One other neat little side note: When they changed the games\r\nout, the system would still be up. First, all game choices would disappear.\r\nThen, two by two, new games would pop up. You could actually see them appear!)", 
      "We had PlayCable for about two years (I think 81-82), and\r\nour cable company was big into promoting it. They had INTV playathons at some\r\nof the local malls, giving away free INTVs to high scorers in certain games.\r\nDuring one promotional weekend, the cable company showed nothing but people\r\nplaying INTV and the announcers commenting on how realistic the game play was.\r\nI think we even have one PlayCable T-shirt lying around somewhere!", 
      "Finally though, our cable company stopped carrying\r\nPlayCable, and unfortunately, we had to surrender the box. I would like to have\r\nkept it to see how it worked. All in all, our family has a lot of fond memories\r\nof PlayCable... I think it helped to enhance the uniqueness and mystery of the\r\nIntellivision.", 
      "This is a large metal briefcase that appears to be a\r\nportable diagnostic unit for testing Intellivision cartridges and the removable\r\nchips from malfunctioning systems. It consists of two controllers mounted onto\r\nthe top of the unit, zero insertion force (ZIF) sockets for testing chips, and\r\nvarious other controls to test the chips under different operating conditions.\r\nTo run the diagnostics, the system uses an integrated MTE-201 test cartridge.\r\nInternally, the system appears to be a modified 2609 motherboard along with an\r\nalternative power supply circuit. It is interesting to note that the\r\ncontrollers mounted on the top of the unit match the layout in the controller\r\ntest section of the MTE-201 tests, which means they are reversed -i.e. the left\r\ncontroller is mounted on the right.

Go to\r\na \"hall of doors\" - doors that line up on either side of you. Put an\r\nobject down, and then GLANCE left or right. When you glance, if there is\r\nanything behind the door, the object you put down may blink for an instant. If\r\nit does, that means that an object is one or two spaces away in the direction\r\nyou glanced. When you return back to your original direction, it may blink\r\nagain. Sometimes, when it blinks, it momentarily turns into the object (or part\r\nof the sprite) that was hidden. For example, if a spear is behind the door, the\r\nitem may briefly become a spear, and then return to whatever it was. It becomes\r\neasier to see if you glance one way, and then hit the other glance the other\r\nbefore you come back to your original position.  To try this in a more surefire\r\nway, find an eyeball mural that has a closable door beside it. Go through the\r\ndoor and then turn around to face the door. The eyeball mural will be on the\r\nother side. Put something down in front of you, and glance both directions.\r\nNotice the object you put down- it will blink, and if you're fast enough, it'll\r\nturn into an eyeball! The reason this may only work on an INTV II system is\r\nbecause there is a slight timing maladjustment inherent to all INTV II's, that\r\nI's and III's supposedly dont.  If that is indeed true, then this works\r\nbecause the timing misfire actually causes the correct sprite to be in the\r\nwrong place due to the screen changes. {Jason Sinclair}",

      "Keith Robinson had this to add on the subject of labels and\r\nboxes:", 
      "Q: I recently came across a pile of Intellivision carts\r\nwith white labels only and was wondering if anybody out there knew the scoop on\r\nthem. Are they any rarer than the colored versions? The manuals also are in\r\nB&W only, not like the ones I already have. Any help would be much\r\nappreciated. Thanks!!", 
      "Pretty cheesy, huh? I was in charge of printing those; Terry\r\nValeski contracted with me to provide all the packaging for the INTV\r\nCorporation releases. He wanted costs as low as possible, so overlays were\r\neliminated where possible (Mattel's policy was that every game had to have\r\noverlays, even if they weren't really needed, such as for Pinball; Valeski got\r\nrid of them), manuals became black & white (folded, not stapled) and labels\r\nwere printed on whatever stock my printer had leftover and would give me a\r\nprice break on. That's why you'll find different size labels on different\r\ncopies of the same game.", 
      "Of course, INTV didn't invent this cost cutting. Mattel's\r\nIntellivision packaging went downhill quickly, too. The original boxes opened\r\nlike a book and had a plastic tray the cartridge fit into. Manuals were all\r\nfull color. The plastic tray was the first thing to go, then the manuals went\r\nto two-color, then the boxes simply became boxes (some games, like BurgerTime,\r\nwere released in both versions of the boxes).", 
      "At INTV, we printed the boxes on an even cheaper grade of\r\ncardboard, but at least Valeski wanted them to be colorful. I designed most of\r\nthem with an art budget of about $800 per box. A painter named Steve Huston did\r\nthe Super Pro sports covers and I did most of the cartoony covers (Thin Ice,\r\nLearning Fun I & II). Other artists and photographers did individual\r\ntitles. I had Joe Ferreira, who did the graphics for Hover Force, do the\r\nartwork for the box. And if the cover art for Thunder Castle looks more\r\nthreatening than the cute graphics in the game, it's because that artwork had\r\nbeen commissioned by Mattel for the Tower of Doom cartridge. Valeski had it\r\nused for Thunder Castle since that game was already completed when he bought\r\nthe Intellivision rights; Tower of Doom was incomplete. He had Tower of Doom\r\nfinished later and I had to come up with new art for its box.", 
      "(By the way, look for the number 47 on the INTV boxes; that\r\nnumber is how Pomona College alumni sort of say \"hello\" to each\r\nother. Dave Warhol, the Pomona alum who produced these games, asked me to slip\r\na 47 into the art whenever possible. Trivia: another Pomona Alum got onto the\r\nstaff of Star Trek, which is why the number 47 pops up in most episodes of Next\r\nGeneration and Voyager, and TWICE in the movie Generations.)", 
      "Sorry that I can't answer your real question though, namely\r\nwhich labels are worth more. That's a question for the collectors. But\r\nremembering how quickly some of this stuff was slapped together, it amuses me\r\ntoday to hear people pondering their value.", 
      "Q: The boxes do not open like the colored ones right? These\r\ngames were reproduced by the INTV corporation after they took over from Mattel.", 
      "Mattel had already switched from the book-cover boxes to\r\nstandard boxes by the time INTV took over. INTV used up Mattel stock, then made\r\nup new batches of the most popular games. In these cases, the INTV boxes are\r\nidentical to the Mattel boxes (printed from the same negatives) except the\r\nMattel Electronics name is deleted and the INTV name and address is added on\r\nthe back. Major League Baseball also underwent a name change to Big League\r\nBaseball, since the Major League trademark either expired or wasn't\r\ntransferable.", 
      "All of the INTV games were released in full-color standard\r\nboxes, except for a brief period where they tried to get away with no boxes \r\nsending out mail orders with the cartridge and instructions simply sealed in a\r\nplastic bag. Consumers complained --loudly --and boxes were quickly reinstated.", 
      "Atari wasn't the only company with plans to introduce a\r\n\"next generation\" video game system; Mattel spoke of it's soon-to-be\r\nreleased Intellivision III for well over a year before the idea was dumped.\r\nHere are some of the specifications for this unit:",

      "-Projected price: $300", 
      "Please note that this unit is COMPLETELY different from\r\nthe INTV III which was later released by INTV Corp in 1986.", 
      "(History taken from http://www.intellivisionlives.com)", 
      "After the Intellivision Keyboard Component was canceled,\r\nMattel was to begin work on a brand new Master Component, the Intellivision IV.\r\nIntellivision III had been rushed into development simply as a stopgap product\r\nto compete short-term with ColecoVision. Intellivision IV, was to introduce the\r\nnext generation of video game systems.", 
      "It carried the codename Decade, since it was to be the\r\ncornerstone product of Mattel Electronics for the rest of the eighties,\r\nIntellivision IV was developed from mid-1982 to mid-1983 secretly in an\r\nunmarked building a mile away from Mattel headquarters. Being away from the\r\ndaily whims and pressures of marketing and administration, the design group was\r\nable to create freely.", 
      "The system they created was based on the MC68000 processor,\r\nthe CPU later used in the first Macintoshes and the Amiga. Video was handled by\r\na custom chip named Magic. Screen resolution was 240 by 192 pixels (40 by 24\r\n4-color 6x8 cards) with a programmable 16-color palette, 16x16 4-color sprites\r\nand hardware scrolling. Onboard software supported 3-D graphics along with\r\nmusic and speech synthesis. The Combo chip coordinated peripheral devices,\r\nincluding a built-in modem: a point-of-view two-person tank battle played over\r\nphone lines was talked about as a typical Intellivision IV application.", 
      "Unlike the other hardware in development in 1983, the\r\nIntellivision IV had the potential of being a significant step forward; after\r\nIntellivision III was canceled, many people saw Intellivision IV as the last\r\nhope for the company. The hope didn't last long. Most of the hardware people\r\nwere soon laid off, including those working on Intellivision IV. The shift\r\ndidn't help; January 20, 1984, Mattel Electronics was shut down.", 
      "Would they have succeeded in creating a super game machine\r\nat an affordable price, or would it have been another Keyboard Component? With\r\nall the secrecy surrounding the project, it's not known how far along the\r\nsystem really was. We do know it never reached the stage of actual game\r\ndevelopment.", 
      "(Special Thanks to: Ted Brunner for finding the\r\nTutorvision and providing this information)", 
      "The World Book Tutorvision is a NR Intellivision.\r\nApparently, World Book, the makers of the encyclopedia line, licensed the\r\nIntellivision hardware from INTV corp in order to release a line of educational\r\nsoftware for it. This was sometime in the late eighties. However, the deal fell\r\nthrough, the system was scrapped before it ever hit production and INTV corp\r\nand World Book even went to court over it.", 
      "From Keith Robinson, spokesman of the Blue Sky Rangers:", 
      "\"INTV Corp. made a deal in the late eighties with World\r\nBook to release an orange Intellivision with special educational software. The\r\nentire deal fell apart with both companies suing each other. Dave Warhol of\r\nRealtime Associates, the company that wrote the special games, has always\r\nmaintained that neither the system nor the games were ever released.\"", 
      "However, a prototype model has been found. Concerning\r\nspecial cartridges for the system, Keith writes:", 
      "\"Again, since we didn't think they were released, we\r\ndon't know what they looked like if they were. However, it's doubtful that INTV\r\nwould have spent money on new molds, so they probably would look just like\r\nregular Intellivision cartridges, although possible in the same color as the\r\nmaster component. We've been trying to put together the complete list of the\r\nWorld Book games, but so far Dave Warhol can't find his files from the project.\r\nHe seems to remember they were to be packaged as two sets with six cartridges\r\nper set. One of the programmers who worked on the games recalls that two of the\r\ntitles were 'Story Stopper' and 'Zoo Review.'\"", 
      "On the inside there of the Tutorvision, there were some\r\nchanges from the old Intellivision model I: the 'brains' are all on one chip,\r\nand the boardset is now just a single board, instead of a motherboard and a\r\npower board. The board also ran off a single 5v voltage, instead of 5 different\r\nvoltages. Most interestingly, the chips were all dated 1988-90, the board was\r\ndated 1988. Furthermore, the system has a power on LED, just like the INTV III.\r\nThe buttons on the keypad are bubble-style and not flat like the INTV III. The\r\nsystem however, plays normal Intellivision cartridges.", 
      "It appears that this is an interesting mix of INTV models.\r\nWhat we are not sure of now is whether the new motherboard layout is the same\r\nas the INTV III or different, and even more so, whether or not the content of\r\nthe chips has changed at all.", 
      "Although released domestically in 1980, the Intellivision's\r\nJapanese debut was over two years later, on July 10, 1982. However, Mattel did\r\nnot market or distribute the system in Japan. Instead, they turned to Bandai, a\r\ntrusted name in electronics to handle the system in Japan. Thus the Bandai Intellivision\r\nwas born.", 
      "Bandai had been in the electronic game business for many\r\nyears in Japan, starting off with a very successful electronic hand held\r\nBaseball game in the 70's. In 1977, Bandai released its own electronic video\r\ngame system, the TV-Jack series (a video game console with burnt-in games and\r\nno cartridge support). The system was successful, spawning multiple upgrades,\r\nbut it was abandoned after its final release (TV-Jack Supervision 8000) in\r\n1979.", 
      "This deal to distribute and market the system in Japan\r\nbetween the two companies was the first of its kind for Bandai, and arguably\r\nthe first sophisticated (especially 16-bit) console release in the Japanese\r\nmarket. From a certain standpoint, it was successful enough and impelled Bandai\r\nto forge similar deals for the Emerson Arcadia (March 1983) and Vectrex (July\r\n1983) in Japan.

      "In the end, although Mattel had helped increase the\r\nawareness and popularity to start the first generation video game console\r\nmarket in Japan, it did not last once the large homegrown Japanese companies\r\ntook hold. Since Bandai was also busy marketing the Emerson Arcadia and Vectrex\r\nin Japan, it left little support for the flagging Intellivision. There was a\r\nlarge number of systems--too many for the flowering market. In the end, none of\r\nthese foreign systems (including the Intellivision) made a large footprint in\r\nthe video game industry in Japan.",

      "As stated before, Mattel did not handle the marketing and\r\ndistribution of the Intellivision in Japan. It was handled by Bandai, who\r\ndrummed up support for the system in all the standard media. There were even\r\nsome television commercials produced for the Intellivision in Japan. A young\r\nactor named Beat Takeshi (who later became a very popular TV and movie actor)\r\nwas used in the commercials. They advertised the console with the slogan\r\n\"Same 16-bit power as a computer, but no loading times\".", 
      "Similar to the Atari distribution in Japan, the games\r\nthemselves were untouched. But, in the case of Intellivision, even the boxes\r\nremained completely in English. On these boxes, the franchise rights were\r\nremoved. So, Major League Baseball became Baseball, etc. Of course, a Japanese\r\ninstruction booklet was provided to inform the customer the basic controls and\r\nhow to play. The overlays were also identical to the American ones and remained\r\nin English. Slits were cut in the back of the boxes for the Japanese\r\ninstructions. So, if the customers flipped over the box, they saw the front\r\npage of the Japanese instructions.", 
      "The box for the base console in Japan was remade completely.\r\nIt had the pictures of all the games with a picture of a happy couple playing\r\nthe Intellivision in the right hand corner. On the back, it described the\r\nsystem and showed pictures of Baseball, Space Battle, etc. Inside the box,\r\nthere was an instruction manual, warranty card and two promotional catalogs.\r\nThe first catalog showed the launch titles, while the second one listed the\r\ngames that were coming soon. The box and all of its contents were in Japanese.", 
      "It is generally assumed that Bandai was skeptical at the\r\nstart, and didn't want to invest a large amount of money in translating and\r\nre-printing the boxes especially since this was their first time at\r\ndistributing another company's system. But, in the end it was just another nail\r\nin the coffin for the system. The popularity of the games was limited. The\r\nlow-cost approach of distribution left customers anxious over a system with\r\ngames almost completely in another language.", 
      "The retail price of the system was 49800 yen ($210, in 1982\r\nUS$). The games themselves cost from 4800-5500yen ($21-23 in 1982 US$).\r\nHowever, for a 16-bit system at the time, Bandai thought that it was an\r\nattractive price. Plus, the lineup of games at the start was large (including\r\nmany sports titles). There were 17 launch games, most of them sports and\r\npopular titles from America. However, the price ended up being too steep for\r\nthe base console, and it never became very popular--a key to success in Japan.\r\nSimilar to North America and Atari, the Intellivision had the power to compete\r\nat the start with the other consoles, but failed to remain on top. But, in\r\nJapan, it was priced the same as a personal computer. Since it lacked the\r\nadditional functionality of the computer, it never really caught on. In a way,\r\nBandai's slogan of comparing it to a personal computer only highlighted its\r\nfaults.", 
      "The Intellivoice module nor any other hardware upgrades were\r\never released. Furthermore, no Japanese specific software was ever released. In\r\ntotal, only 27 (Mattel only) known titles were released in Japan. Overall,\r\napproximately 30,000 units of the base system were sold in total and two years\r\nafter it was born, Bandai abandoned the system and the Bandai Intellivision\r\nfaded into obscurity.", 
      "Bandai Intellivision Frequently Asked Questions:", 
      "Q: How did the properties and rights to NHL, NBA, MLB,\r\nNASL, etc. transfer to Japan?", 
      "A: It is an interesting question. Since the rights to the\r\ngames were not transferable when Mattel sold the rights to the INTV\r\nCorporation, it is doubtful that they were transferable to Bandai. But, it is\r\nunknown whether there was any real infringement or legal action taken by any of\r\nthe respective companies. All of the boxes in Japan did not carry any franchise\r\nrights, except for PBA bowling. But, there seemed to be some confusion because\r\non the back of the box, and in the game catalogs, many of the games appear with\r\nlicensing. Even the cartridges and the manuals have licensing.", 
      "Q: Any plans for any specific software titles for the\r\nJapanese market?", 
      "A: Doubtful. The Intellivision did not last a significant\r\namount of time. The time and costs involved in developing Japanese specific\r\ntitles would have been significant. Furthermore, Bandai did not have a large\r\nsoftware division, nor did it see the gains necessary to invest in one for the\r\nIntellivision. Other software houses in Japan, especially Sega and Nintendo\r\nwere concentrating on their own launches. It seems that Bandai didn't court any\r\nother software companies to produce games for the Intellivision.", 
      "Q: Any plans for INTV to re-enter the Japanese market?", 
      "A: Highly doubtful. By the time that INTV re-assembled the\r\nIntellivision name, and started selling software again, Nintendo and Sega were\r\ndominating the Japanese market. Any attempt to re-enter would have been futile.\r\nFurthermore, the secret to INTV's short success in North America was through\r\nsignificant cost-cutting and completing Mattel's unfinished games. They would\r\nrequire substantial capital to re-start the Intellivision engine in Japan.", 
      "Q: I look at the list of games, and I don't see\r\nAstrosmash, what gives?", 
      "A: Yes. It never made it here. Probably because it debuted\r\nin 1982, the Space Invaders craze was over by then. Bandai didn't want to\r\npromote an older game, and concentrated on the more unique titles. Furthermore,\r\nthey already chose Space Armada as a launch title. As for why Space Armada was\r\nchosen over Astrosmash, who knows?", 
      "Q: Can I play US games in a Bandai Intellivision?", 
      "A: The games released in Japan are identical to the American\r\nones. There is no region lockout because there is only one region. Therefore,\r\nthe Bandai can play games from any regional market, just like any\r\nIntellivision.", 
      "Not much is known about Digiplay, other than they initially\r\nseemed to be the Brazilian distributor for Mattel. Most of the original Mattel\r\ngames localized for the Brazilian market had fully localized boxes, manuals,\r\nand even cartridge labels and overlays; much more than was done in Japan with\r\nBandai.", 
      "Not only were the games localized, but so was the Master\r\nComponent. Their variation of the original 2609, the 5368, even had localized\r\ntext on the top of the unit, but was still tagged as being from Mattel\r\nElectronics. The documentation listed Digiplay as the distributor or some such,\r\nI think. The Intellivision II was also produced by Digiplay and even had the\r\nDigiplay logo on the front of the unit in place of the Mattel logo.", 
      "It seems that Digiplay was not interested in doing things\r\nhalfway. The boxes, manuals, labels, and overlays were almost always completely\r\ntranslated into Portuguese, and the manuals were even done up with full color\r\ncovers. All of the boxes I've seen were also book-style boxes even for games\r\nthat Mattel delivered in cheaper kinds of boxes. Later releases, like Masters\r\nof the Universe: The Power of He-Man doesnt bear the Mattel logo at all. In\r\nfact, my He-Man lists \"TM -IMAGIC\" on the back of the manual.", 
      "My guess is that initially, Digiplay had an agreement to\r\ndistribute the Intellivision system and worked out some sort of deal with\r\nMattel. The deal involved a requirement to localize the games for the market.\r\nThen, a few things happened. The market started to soften in the U.S.A. in\r\n1983, but, as things tend to operate in global markets, the crash didn't hit\r\nthe Brazilian market yet. It probably lagged by several months or even a year\r\nor more. Digiplay also picked up permission to deliver Activision and Imagic\r\ngames. Later, back in the U.S., Intellivision, Inc. / INTV Corp. kept the\r\nIntellivision alive as well, and Activision bought out Imagic.", 
      "Why is that relevant? Well, there is one thing that's odd to\r\nme about the overlay situation here. Most of the original Mattel games released\r\nby Digiplay seem to also come with localized overlays. However, some seem to\r\ncome with overlays that could have come from the Intellivision, Inc. era as\r\nwell. By this, I mean that many copies of the original Mattel games came with\r\noverlays that had the Mattel Electronics copyright removed. Well, most of the\r\nDigiplay versions of the older Mattel games came with localized overlays\r\nproduced on materials that are clearly very different from standard overlays.\r\nHowever, some later ones, like Reversi, come with overlays that are in English,\r\nbut have no copyright date on them. Similarly, the Activision releases also have\r\nno copyright date on them.",

The games were made to be rented at local\r\nvideo stores all over South America. Whether this idea was realized, or the\r\ncompany went out of business, is unclear to me. The company then contacted the\r\nvideo stores to offer the games at low prices. Since the American versions of\r\nthe games were much more expensive, many were bought by locals in the region.\r\nThe games did not come with overlays or a box, but did come with a set of typed\r\ninstructions. These game carts are much larger than the regular sized Intellivision\r\nshell. They are even bigger than the Coleco style game carts. There are 4\r\nIntelli Games that are known to exist.

      "Mattel had four different designs in their cartridge casings.\r\nThe first two had screws holding it together, and the final two didn't. The\r\nfirst design uses a common Philips bit. The second uses a triangular bit.\r\nHere's some info on making your own bit to open those second generation\r\ncartridges: courtesy of Ryan (TokenGamer)", 
      "Take a robertson bit/screwdriver of similar size. Borrow an\r\nangle grinder and roughly but carefully grind down 2 sides to make the square\r\ninto a triangle. Use rough to fine sandpaper to do the fine grinding. Tape the\r\nsand paper on a flat table surface and rub the bit on it untill you have the\r\nright size triangle. If you need to round the corners or reduce the diameter of\r\nthe bit/shank: put the bit in a power drill, put on a thick glove and pinch the\r\nsand paper around the bit as you run the drill at full speed. it gets hot so if\r\nyou don't have a thick glove you'll have to do it in stages to let it cool\r\ndown. The other method is to try the pen method which is only temporary and\r\ndoesn't last very long. Get a plastic pen and take out the ink core. Use a\r\nlighter to soften the plastic but don't burn it, go slow. When it's nice and\r\npliable, jam it into the head of the bit and let it cool completely. When it\r\ncools it will form into the shape of the screw head and you can use it until it\r\nbreaks. It doesn't usually last long. the bic pen method is more for desperate\r\nmeasures.",

They are missing the power\r\nsupply, and the hand controllers are inoperative. On the original unit, the\r\nmylar keypad is held onto the controller wires by pressure from two screws.\r\nWhen a hand controller on the original Master component stops working\r\ncorrectly, usually taking them apart, cleaning and putting them back together,\r\nmaking sure the screws are tight does the trick. On the Intellivision II\r\ncontrollers, there are no screws! I ended up breaking one apart to see how they\r\nworked (it was trashed already of course). The knowledge I gained allowed me to\r\ncarefully take apart a few controllers to cobble two together to go with my II\r\nMaster Component.", 
      "The first thing that needs to be done is the top piece has\r\nto be taken off. This is the piece that the disc is flush with. It is held on\r\nby little plastic \"hooks\". These \"hooks\" are located in five\r\nspots. The first is in the center at the bottom of the disc. The next two are\r\nlocated on both sides, right where the top of the disk ends, and the keypad\r\nbegins. The other two are right at the top, where the overlay slides in.", 
      "Use a small screw driver to press the plastic at the correct\r\nlocation, and pry each of the hooks out in an upward motion, being sure not to\r\nbreak them. This part is very important and cannot be broken. Be sure to look\r\nfor the four teeth that slide into the hand controller and rest behind the four\r\nbuttons. These cannot be broken. Their purpose is to press the mylar when the\r\nbuttons are pressed against them. The buttons push on these plastic teeth,\r\nwhich in turn puts pressure on the mylar. Take the disc, disc spring, and\r\nplastic cover and put aside.", 
      "Now comes the tricky part. Getting the cover off of the base\r\nis difficult. Examine your controller and see if the bottom of the controller\r\nhas a crack in it, or if the buttons are broken. If it is obvious the buttons\r\nare broken, try and save the cover... if the bottom and buttons are good,\r\nCAREFULLY press the bottom part of the controller.", 
      "Usually, I start on the right hand bottom side, and end up\r\nbreaking the hooks there. Then getting the other hooks to let go is a little\r\neasier. Breaking one set of hooks is not that serious, because one can glue the\r\ncontroller closed on re-assembly. Make sure that the buttons do not get broken\r\noff when sliding the top cover off! Once this step is done, replace the\r\nwires/mylar pad/keypad numbers as required. It is then time to reassemble. Make\r\nsure that you do not forget the circular plastic piece between the mylar.

      "I joined TRW right out of grad school, I was working there\r\nas a software engineer. I had started in Feb. 1981, just as the Reagan\r\nAdministration came into office. The job I was supposed to work on was frozen,\r\nand there was an enormous delay in getting any kind of security clearance, so\r\nthat limited what projects were available to me. As a result, I spent my first\r\nyear there not accomplishing very much on a variety of small projects.", 
      "How/Why did you come to work at Mattel?", 
      "In the spring of 1982, I heard on the radio of an Open House\r\n/ Job Fair at Mattel Electronics, and I thought it would be a fun way to spend\r\nthe afternoon -playing with their latest games and gadgets. I was not very\r\nhappy about my job at TRW, but I wasn't looking to go anywhere. When I got\r\nthere, I started talking to one of the managers about Dungeons & Dragons, a\r\npersonal passion of mine. He was looking for some people to develop a D & D\r\nstyle game for the Intellivision Keyboard, the big keyboard. One thing led to\r\nanother, and in a few weeks I was on board at Mattel Electronics.", 
      "Exactly which games did you personally program?", 
      "Loco-Motion was the only game I programmed start to finish.\r\nI also programmed Tower of Doom but I only had the game about 80% done when\r\nMattel Electronics went out of business. I had concentrated on the special\r\neffects and mechanics, but I hadn't put in the game play and strategy that I\r\nhad had in mind. A few years later, one of the guys was contracting out with\r\nwhoever it was that had bought up all the Intellivision property (was that\r\nINTV?) to finish a bunch of the games that were in development when M.E. went\r\nunder. Tower of Doom was one of those games. I had since moved from California\r\nto Massachusetts, and so had not the equipment, nor time to do the completion.\r\nHe got one of the other programmers to finish it up, but he didn't add any game\r\nplay either, he just tidied up the loose ends so that the game had an ending\r\nand wouldn't crash.", 
      "Were you involved in programming any other games?", 
      "Most games were developed by a single Game Designer, with\r\nthe help of certain \"specialists.\" There were a few graphic artists\r\nwho designed most of the graphics for most of the games, a few sound people who\r\ndeveloped most of the sound effects. However, the total game development and\r\nintegration was done by a single engineer.", 
      "There was a lot of testing, feedback, and reviews amongst\r\nthe game designers. A significant portion of our work week was assigned to\r\nplaying other people's games to find bugs, cite improvements and offer\r\nsuggestions. To this end I worked on several games, but that wouldn't qualify\r\nas programming.", 
      "I also worked on several projects that just didn't go\r\nanywhere, and were dropped. The whole big keyboard project (for which I had\r\nbeen hired) was dropped not long after I started working there. It was deemed\r\nto be to expensive to produce, so that it would be un-saleable. Subsequently it\r\nwas redesigned, and code-named \"LUCKI\" [pronounced 'lucky'] for Low\r\nUser-Cost Keyboard Interface. I started developing a Stock Market game for the\r\nLUCKI, when, one day, the arcade version of Loco-Motion turned up next to my\r\ncubicle. I watched and played several games, and I was hooked. Literally\r\novernight I had developed an Intellivision prototype of the arcade game, and\r\nthe rest, as they say, is history.", 
      "What was it like working for Mattel?", 
      "It was an absolute blast! The people there were all a bunch\r\nof overgrown kids, and management encouraged us to work on having fun as hard\r\nas get-ting product out. The result was an atmosphere of great teamwork and\r\ncamaraderie. Some examples:",

      "Can you fill us in on any 'unfinished' projects that may\r\nhave been in the works when Mattel Electronics went out of business?", 
      "I'm afraid that I can't be much help here. So I'll answer a\r\ndifferent question. Things started turning down for the entire video game\r\nmarket around the beginning of 1983. I finished Loco-Motion, and in the summer,\r\nstarted working on Tower of Doom. It was originally supposed to be a\r\nvoice-optional game, and by the fall I was putting in many long hours focused\r\non getting that going. Around October, Mattel had its first round of layoffs.\r\nAbout 1/3 of the staff was gone over-night. The atmosphere had become quite\r\ndepressed, and I coped by becoming ever more involved with working on Tower of\r\nDoom, and blocking out what was going on around me.", 
      "In November we had the second round of layoffs, and another\r\nthird of the staff was gone. It seemed like there was no hope left for the few\r\nof us that remained, but I kept plugging away at T-O-D, hoping that I'd have\r\nenough time to finish the game. Unfortunately, in January 1984, Mattel\r\nElectronics went out of business, and that was that.", 
      "So, about all I remember from that time period was how\r\ndepressing things got, and how desperate I was getting, hoping that I'd be able\r\nto finish T-O-D.", 
      "As game collectors, one of the biggest problems we have\r\nis finding out exactly what games are out there to be had. Do you know of any\r\ngames that may be in existence that are not listed on the 'complete' listing I\r\nsent you?",

      "There was a Pinball game I liked, but I was always more into\r\npinball machines than Arcade Video games. Buzz Bombers and Thin Ice were both\r\ncute.

      "How/Why did you come to work at Mattel?", 
      "After graduating from UCLA in 1978, I did a lot of\r\ninterviewing. Most of the local companies in Southern California were defense\r\noriented and I wasn't particularly interested in going down that path at that\r\ntime. I also talked to a number of chip companies in Silicon Valley. By far,\r\nthe most interesting job was the one at Mattel. I had my doubts about Mattel's long\r\nterm stability, since they had recently completed some litigation about how\r\nthey were running the business and also since the toy industry in general tends\r\nto follow boom and bust cycles. However, in the final analysis, it came down to\r\nthat sure sounds like it would be a lot of fun.", 
      "Exactly which games did you personally program? Were you\r\ninvolved in programming any other games?", 
      "In Intellivision, my games for Mattel were BurgerTime and I\r\nalso did about half the programming on Masters of the Universe. After Mattel\r\ngot out of the business, I worked on Diner (a BurgerTime sequel) and Super Pro\r\nHockey for INTV, who took over the Intellivision business from Mattel. I also\r\nworked on the concept development for Super Pro Football, though I didn't do\r\nany of the programming. In handheld games, I wrote Computer Gin and World\r\nChampionship Football. In addition, I also worked with a championship chess\r\nplayer on Computer Chess.", 
      "What was it like working for Mattel?", 
      "It was a blast! The best part by far was the team that we\r\nhad put together. There was lots of diversity the talents and interests of\r\nmembers of the group and that added a lot to the quality of the games. In fact,\r\nevery year there is the annual layoff reunion party, where everyone gets\r\ntogether to reminisce and network and all those sorts of good things. Next year\r\nis the 10th anniversary, so there may be some special festivities planned.", 
      "Can you fill us in on any 'unfinished' projects that may\r\nhave been in the works when Mattel Electronics went out of business?", 
      "When things went under at Mattel, I was working on a sequel\r\nto Masters of the Universe with a lot of Escher-looking screens. After a few\r\nmutations and change in characters and story line, I was able to finish that game\r\nas Diner, a sequel to BurgerTime done by INTV. When INTV bought out the rights\r\nto Intellivision, they bought the right to all the work in progress at the\r\ntime. Much of the work that was fairly far along was later published by INTV,\r\nso you can see what was happening at that point. After a while, we ran out of\r\npre-existing work, and so we ended up doing some new work and other sequels to\r\nexisting games, especially the sports titles.", 
      "Do you still own an Intellivision system?", 
      "Of course! Since the machines tended to breakdown every so\r\noften and since I suspected that it would become increasingly difficult to get\r\nthem fixed, I made sure to store away 3 or 4 Intellivision in the attic to make\r\nsure that my kids would be able to see what I had done at Mattel. So far, I\r\nhave only lost one machine, so they were a lot more reliable than I thought\r\nthey would be.", 
      "What was/is your personal favorite Intellivision game?", 
      "Of the work that I did, I would probably rank Diner as my\r\nfavorite, followed closely by BurgerTime. I would also rank Night Stalker\r\npretty highly. I also played a lot of Sea Battle and would count that among my\r\nfavorites.", 
      "What is your line of work now?", 
      "After Mattel went under, since there was so little\r\ncommercial work around the area and no video games work anywhere at the time, I\r\nwent to TRW to work on defense systems. Fortunately, I was able to get involved\r\nwith some pretty fun projects using early versions of Sun Workstations and so I\r\nwas able to have some fun, learning lots about GUI and all those things that\r\nare still increasing in popularity. I even designed a paint program for a\r\ngovernment project, probably one of the only paint programs ever done\r\nspecifically for the government.", 
      "Since then, I've moved over to the PC business and am doing\r\nWindows work for first for Software Publishing Corporation on Harvard Graphics\r\nfor Windows. I also worked on their Info Alliance project, which was one of the\r\nfirst GUI database projects available. Unfortunately, though the market was\r\nready for such a product, SPC was not and the product died an unfortunate\r\ndeath. Currently, I am at Borland working on future versions of Paradox for\r\nWindows.", 
      "Lastly, Dan said I had to ask you about your\r\n\"Cheeseburger Birthday Cake\". What gives???", 
      "Dan's wife was taking a cake decorating class and one day\r\nthey surprised me and brought in a birthday cake shaped like a giant hamburger.\r\nObviously the connection was BurgerTime.", 
      "How did you come about working with the Intellivision,\r\nand what role did you play in its software/hardware development?", 
      "In 1981, I'd been working for Pacific Telephone for about a\r\nyear and a half. This was my first real job after leaving graduate school. I'd\r\nmessed around with the music industry, done a little \"international\r\nconsulting\", some of the typical things one does when one does not know\r\nwhat to do.", 
      "Anyway, Pacific Telephone was fun... I was working with\r\nelectronic switching, international testing (I got to call Lybia once),\r\nprogramming custom services, various things. They had lots of UNIX machines to\r\nplay with, so it was also a sort of immersion course in Unix computing...", 
      "I started to get bored. I'd gone to most of the schools; I'd\r\nworked on various interesting projects. I was spending a lot of time and money\r\nat Opamp Technical Books in Hollywood (still in business, still a great place),\r\nand I was beginning to want to do something more --well --interesting.", 
      "Mattel was running huge ads in the paper. At the time, my\r\nmain concern was the commute. I lived about 10 minutes from the Pacific\r\nTelephone facility in Hollywood, Hawthorne seemed far away. After a while, I\r\ngot over this concern, and went to one of Mattel's job fairs (back in those\r\ndays, LOTS of companies were having them). I got along with the people right\r\naway. Intellivision was an established product; they wanted to do more with it.\r\nThey wanted to add voice synthesis. They were looking for someone with a\r\nlinguistics background (that's what I majored in!) and who understood computers\r\n(thank you, Pacific Telephone).", 
      "This was Saturday. They asked me to come back Monday. I\r\ntalked with some more people, and filled out the application. They were talking\r\ngood money, and it sure sounded interesting. By the time I got back to\r\nHollywood, I had a message on my machine; they offered me the job that day.", 
      "I gave notice at Pacific Telephone, gave myself about a week\r\noff, and started to work. My first day was Monday... and already things were\r\ngetting interesting. I had to fly to New York the next day to help with the\r\nspeech for the first game. This game grew up to be Space Spartans, but, at the\r\ntime, all anyone knew was that it was a space game of some sort. It was\r\nsupposed to be a short trip; it turned out to be several weeks. I recall that\r\ndue to the short notice I got to fly first class, and sat right behind Count\r\nBasie and a member of his band...", 
      "I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me explain how speech was\r\nmade for these games. Along with the game idea, a script was written. I\r\ntranscribed the script (into phonetic transcription) and made sure there were\r\nno critical words that would be \"transformed\" too badly by the speech\r\nsynthesis process.", 
      "After the script was written, auditions were held. I used my\r\ncontacts in the music industry to find good agents and a good recording studio.\r\nWe looked for good voices, good acting, and actors that could work with some of\r\nthe odd requirements of speech synthesis --not too many 'hissing' ess [s]\r\nsounds, no loud popping p's and so on. I finally developed a pretty good ear\r\nfor which voices would synthesize well...", 
      "After the recording, the voices were sampled. We used a\r\nHewlett-Packard 1000 series machine with the ILS signal processing package and\r\na large amount of custom software.", 
      "The sampled speech was fed to the synthesis software for the\r\nIntellivoice speech synthesizer, the General Instrument SP-256.", 
      "Synthesized speech could be generated quickly. The problem\r\nis that automatically generated speech took up a lot of space (that could be\r\nused for more speech or game code). This was a big problem! The other problem\r\nis that the automatic speech synthesis didn't always sound that good... some of\r\nit was actually pretty bad.", 
      "The solution to both problems was manual editing of the\r\noriginal waveform before the speech was synthesized. This was done with a good,\r\nbut somewhat primitive editor. Segments to be used for synthesis could be\r\nmarked, and speech could be deleted. The resulting files could be submitted for\r\nsynthesis; the results were usually speech that took up less space that the\r\nautomatic speech and that sounded good.", 
      "For the first six months or so, I did everything --work on\r\nscripts, transcriptions, auditions, recording sessions, speech editing. I did\r\nalmost all the speech that you hear on \"Space Spartans\" and\r\n\"B-17 Bomber.\"", 
      "By the time \"Bomb Squad\" came along, Mattel wanted\r\nto be more organized. A formal speech group was set up --I trained the editors,\r\nlargely on what you hear in \"Bomb Squad!\" The last speech game was\r\n\"Tron: Solar Sailor\", I did not have much to do with that one.", 
      "I went on to work on some other things for Mattel: consumer\r\nmusical productions, and advanced technologies for the games, specifically a\r\nrapid prototyping environment. For a while Mattel was also very interested in\r\nentering the European marketplace, so I worked on Spanish, German, French, and\r\nItalian versions of \"Space Spartans.\" That ROM is out there\r\nsomewhere...", 
      "I've heard that Mattel had a \"laid back\"\r\nenvironment: it was a fun place to work. Would you say the same?", 
      "Fun place to work? Sure, especially if you liked video\r\ngames. I didn't, and still don't. But remember, this was during the time when\r\nit seemed like there was a Pac-Man machine everywhere.", 
      "Mattel had some very good people. Most of us were about the\r\nsame age... late 20s, early 30s, I guess. Many common interests apart from the\r\ngames. I played Geddy Lee style bass in an informal group called the Redi Spuds\r\n(named after a sign on a nearby building) that played sort of a new wave rock;\r\nyes, a total mismatch of styles, but fun... I shudder to think of what it would\r\nsound like now, with my more Percy Jones influenced style.", 
      "You could always find someone interesting to talk to, even\r\nthough I don't think they planned it, there was quite a lot of synergy. In\r\nspeech, we were doing things with audio on minicomputers that are commonplace\r\nnow in this age of samplers... but we solved the problems years ago.", 
      "Laid back? Well, the games programmers didn't work on much\r\nof a fixed schedule. I was interested in seeing what could be done with natural\r\nlanguage processing technology. I should also say that I'm probably NOT a very\r\nlaid back type of person! I was never really all that happy in California, and\r\nmy lack of laid back inclinations may explain why I'm one of the few people I know\r\nof who moved from Los Angeles to Washington, DC.", 
      "Would you know of any unfinished hardware or software\r\nthat Mattel may have been working on (besides the previously mentioned foreign\r\nROM)? Video game collectors just love this kind of thing.", 
      "Unfinished games... there were probably lots and lots of them;\r\nthings came crashing down pretty fast. ROMs? I don't know, probably not many of\r\nthem had been made into ROMs yet.", 
      "There was a thing called \"Decade\" which was a\r\n68000 based system that could have been Macintosh like, had they completed it.\r\nThere were prototype wireless remote controls for Intellivision. There were\r\nplans for all sorts of interfaces... Apple II, IBM PC, and so on.", 
      "You may have seen the Synsonics drums, four touch pads and\r\nsome buttons with some rudimentary programming/memory capability. There were\r\nalso a Synsonics guitar, with \"strum bars\" for your right/picking\r\nhand and a neck full of switches for your left/fretting hand. I don't think\r\nthis ever saw production, but I've seen things like it in the COMB and DAMARK\r\ncatalogues.", 
      "Thanks for the interview, Patrick. I appreciated it.", 
      "No problem...", 
      "The Intellivision lives on, albeit in a different form. Now,\r\nthe Intellivision can be emulated by the functions of the PC, PS, or whatever.\r\nPlease support the commercial emulators wherever possible! The Intellivision\r\ncan live on, let's not piss on its grave.",

      "Not\r\nall that glitters is platinum, however. It’s during the early 1990s\r\nthat we really begin to see games marred by sloppy code, particularly\r\non the DOS and Windows platforms. Many otherwise impressive games were\r\ndoomed at the start by hundreds of game-crashing glitches, which\r\ninfuriated gamers and united critics against them.", 
      "The\r\nlikeliest explanation for the preponderance of bugs during this era is\r\nan industry-wide shift in development methods. Instead of just a\r\nhandful or even a single person in charge of the coding, games were\r\nbeing built by increasingly large teams of specialized programmers, who\r\nwould work on individual parts and then jam everything together. While\r\nthis process occasionally went smoothly, more often that not bits of\r\nthe code were incompatible, and finding bugs in such massive piles of\r\ncode was like finding the proverbial unassigned pointer in the memory\r\nstack.", 
      "Another key issue was the lack of industry\r\nstandards among early graphic and sound card manufacturers; developers\r\nhad to slap together code to support dozens of different standards—or\r\nrisk alienating hordes of money-waving gamers. While it's now\r\nrelatively easy to download and install a patch to address such issues,\r\nmost people weren't online until well after many of these bug-infested\r\ngames had passed out of circulation.", 
      "Up to now, I've\r\ntried to simplify things by postponing my discussion of MUDs\r\n(Multi-User Dungeons) and MMORPGs (Massively Multi-player Online\r\nRole-Playing Games), which can actually trace their history as far back\r\nas the stand-alone CRPG. I'll explain why at the end of this article.", 
      "Although\r\nhighly polished, many of the CRPGs developed during this time are\r\nhighly derivative and offer little innovation, but a few have managed\r\nto attain cult classic status.", 
      "The goal of\r\nthe game is simply to win fame and fortune; the game is quite\r\nopen-ended and avoids many of the stale D&D clichés. Magic, for\r\ninstance, is based on the ancient art of alchemy and is quite\r\nintricate, and clerics can call on 140 different saints, each with a\r\nunique personality.", 
      "Many gamers appreciated its\r\nintelligent character generation system, which involved adding years on\r\nto the character's starting age in return for valuable skills.\r\nUnfortunately, the game's code was riddled with show-stopping bugs, and\r\ngamers found the save game system irritating at best. Nevertheless, it\r\nremains a cult classic with a small but highly dedicated following.", 
      "The\r\ngame does feature a unique character generation method involving\r\neugenics and DNA manipulation. After choosing an appropriate set of\r\nparents, players can \"mutate\" their characters' DNA in exchange for\r\nbetter stats. The trade-off, however, is greater susceptibility to\r\ndisease. Players also get to choose which schools and universities\r\ntheir characters attend. In any case, the game was not a hit, and\r\nalthough there was a sequel released in Germany, an English version\r\nnever arrived on American shores.", 
      "Players also have more direct control during combat: The type of attack\r\n(slash, stab, hack) is indicated by the position of the mouse pointer,\r\nand the strength by how long the player holds down the mouse button.\r\nMany gamers and critics argued that these innovations made the game\r\nrealistic and thus more immersive, as though players were actually in\r\nthe game rather than simply controlling it from a distance.", 
      "The storyline is fairly straightforward. Somehow, the Avatar has found\r\nhimself back in Britannia just in time to witness a creature carting\r\noff a Baron's daughter in a sack. Naturally enough, the guards suspect\r\nthe Avatar of being an accomplice. Fortunately, he's spared the noose,\r\nbut only on the condition that he enter a fearsome dungeon called the\r\n\"Great Stygian Abyss\", and return with the Baron's daughter.", 
      "Soon\r\nenough, the Avatar encounters some survivors of a failed colony, and\r\neventually learns that the kidnapping is only part of a much more\r\nsinister plot. It's a good storyline that makes the game more than just\r\na 3D coding feat.", 
      "We might\r\nnot think much of this issue today, but this was at a time when many PC\r\nowners didn't even own mice, much less see them as a game device.", 
      "Perhaps\r\nmore endearing than the plot are the characters, who are far better\r\ndeveloped here than in almost any other CRPG. Instead of merely\r\nstanding in one place for all eternity just to offer you a thinly\r\ndisguised hint or geographical tidbit, the characters are shown walking\r\nabout, engaging in their daily activities--they even to go to bed at\r\nnight. Conversations with these characters are also more convincing,\r\nand can speak about several topics.", 
      "Critics have remained\r\nunwilling to forgive the awkward combat system, though there doesn’t\r\nseem to be any hope for a general consensus on the overall quality of\r\nthese games.", 
      "Nevertheless,\r\nSSI trudged on for several more years, though they would eventually\r\nshift their focus back to strategy games before officially entering the\r\n\"Where are they now?\" file.", 
      "Although\r\nsuch bugs would be easily enough addressed today by downloadable\r\npatches, such a practice wasn't widely practiced in the early 1990s. If\r\nyou were unlucky enough to buy an early version of the game, you just\r\nhad to live with the bugs.", 
      "Nevertheless,\r\ngamers quickly complained about the endless number of boring battles\r\nthat dragged out the game and ruined its pacing. This is particularly\r\nnoticeable in the crucial first stages of the game; the game requires\r\nconsiderable patience before anything remotely interesting happens.", 
      "Sadly for SSI,  these well-crafted and highly playable games seem to have attracted  little interest from CRPG fans then or now.", 
      "The\r\ntask of transforming Parallax Software's brilliant FPS engine into a\r\nCRPG platform proved far more formidable than anyone had assumed.\r\nBesides sloppy coding and countless game-stopping bugs, the game\r\nsuffered in general from a lack of polish. The levels were dreary and\r\nlooked too much alike, and many players didn't appreciate their\r\nconfusing, maze-like arrangement.", 
      "Poor graphics\r\ncoupled with worse artificial intelligence added up to what we might\r\nexpect--the game promptly descended into the landfill. Undoubtedly, TSR\r\nwas beginning to wonder if it hadn't been better off with SSI!", 
      "So far, I've painted  a pretty bleak picture of CRPG development in the early to mid 1990s,  but things were not all bad.", 
      "By 1996, almost all serious PC gamers\r\n(and plenty of not so serious ones!) had upgraded their computers with\r\nthe latest game hardware, which included CD-ROMs and expensive graphics\r\nand sound cards. Furthermore, what was formerly a forbidding mess of\r\nincompatible cards was solidifying into a few recognized industry\r\nstandards, and a huge market was opening up for games that could really\r\npush this advanced hardware.", 
      "Indeed,\r\nit's really the sophistication of this virtual world that makes the\r\ngame so notable. The plot--find the eight missing pieces of the \"Staff\r\nof Chaos\" and use it to rescue the Emperor from a dimensional\r\nprison--is hardly original. What impressed gamers was the incredible\r\nsize of the world, the open-ended nature of the gameplay, and the\r\nsupposedly high replay value (starting a new game reset the locations\r\nof quest items--though it's truly debatable how much this added to the\r\ngame's replay value).", 
      "Nevertheless,\r\nthe game is far from perfect. Like so many other games of this period,\r\nit suffers from bug-infested code. The battles are also quite a bit\r\ntougher than some gamers could handle, and the game's formidable specs\r\nlimited its appeal to those with cutting-edge machines.", 
      "The leveling system had\r\nalso been revamped a bit, and split into two: Primary Stats (speed,\r\npersonality, luck, etc.) and Secondary Abilities (combat arts, magic\r\narts, etc.). Primary stats only rose when the character gains a level,\r\nbut secondary abilities improve with use. The system may sound\r\ncomplicated, but it's actually quite intuitive. Characters who run and\r\njump often will see a spike in their acrobatics score. Characters who\r\nwield an axe will see their \"axe\" score raised, and so on. Besides just\r\npracticing a skill to gain experience, characters can also buy training\r\nor read special books sprinkled throughout the game.", 
      "Although the\r\ncombat system isn't perfect--all four characters are always on the\r\nfront line and susceptible to frontal assaults--the game nevertheless\r\nwon high praise from critics, and for good reason. Who can forget the\r\nfirst time their wizard cast a \"fly\" spell, sending the party soaring\r\nhigh above Enroth?", 
      "The ability to add a dragon\r\nto the party might have been a nice feature, but doing so ruins the\r\ngame's balance, reducing it to an unbearably dull walk through. As if\r\nthese problems weren't enough to doom the game, other features like a\r\nthree-tiered teacher system (expert, master, and grand-master) made\r\nlong-suffering virtues out of note-taking and tedious back-tracking.\r\nNeedless to say, very few fans were pleased with the game. Sadder still\r\nis the unforgivably buggy code, of which random crashes are some of the\r\nleast irksome.", 
      "One\r\nfascinating aspect of the Platinum Age is how many companies managed to\r\nreach both their apex and their nadir within such a short span of\r\nyears, but for different reasons.", 
      "So\r\nfar, the best Platinum Age innovations in the CRPG genre have been in\r\ntwo realms: The rise of real-time, 3D graphics in first-person\r\nperspective, and the development of huge, highly interactive game\r\nworlds.", 
      "The class system had also been\r\nreworked, with five (Paladin, Barbarian, Amazon, Necromancer,\r\nSorceress) classes, each with their own unique skills. Leveling up is\r\nalso a bit more interesting with a graphical \"skill tree\" system that\r\nhelps sustain a player's long-term interest in developing a\r\ncharacter--there's always some new amazing new ability just a few\r\nlevels away.", 
      "This\r\njuxtaposition makes for some of the most compelling moments in gaming\r\nhistory, and I doubt there is anyone who doesn't get goosebumps the\r\nfirst time he witnesses the introductory cut-scenes. Furthermore, the\r\naesthetics run all the way through the game, including the interface.", 
      "Black Isle wasn’t  the only company releasing brave new CRPGs that were willing to  abandon the old swords and sorcery formula.", 
      "It can be quite exhilarating, for instance,\r\nfor a dwarf to draw a flintlock pistol rather than the clichéd old axe\r\nor hammer. The outcome of the game depends on whether players follow\r\nthe magical or the technological path; the choice is left to the\r\nplayer.", 
      "The\r\nengine is designed to allow most battles to be fought by a highly\r\nconfigurable artificial intelligence system; the player need only sit\r\nback and watch. However, players can always hit the space bar to pause\r\nthe game and manually assign actions, then resume the game to see them\r\ncarried out. This compromise between real-time and turn-based combat\r\nresulted in very compelling gameplay, and has much to offer both\r\nnovices and aficionados of the genre.", 
      "There is also a skill system that\r\nallows further customization and trade-offs; a thief who puts too many\r\npoints into \"open lock\" may be rotten at disabling traps or moving\r\nstealthily. Finally, players can \"multi-class\" their characters however\r\nthey wish, even to the point of giving each character a level in\r\nfighting or thieving just for kicks. However, again there's a\r\ntrade-off; really cool abilities are available only to very high-level\r\nmembers of a certain class. Too much hybridization results in a \"jack\r\nof all trades, master of none\" type character that is mostly worthless.", 
      "No\r\ndoubt, part of my own distaste for this game stems from its title,\r\nwhich represents a brazen attempt to lure unwary fans of the legendary\r\nGold Box game to this uninspired, insipid, and downright unplayable\r\ntravesty. Indeed, my contempt for this game tempted me to omit it\r\nentirely from my history. I'd heard about the game months before it was\r\nreleased, and counted down the days until I could re-enter Phlan and\r\nchallenge Tyranthraxus once again.", 
      "The\r\nturn-based combats quickly become agony as the characters and endless\r\nsea of skeletons lethargically plod into position. Heck, the skeletons\r\nlook about as lively as the player! I was frustrated enough to download\r\na hack to speed up the combats, which eased my frustration, but I can\r\nonly blame my willingness to actually complete this game as evidence of\r\nmasochistic tendencies.", 
      "Although\r\nboth offer no small share of delights, it just doesn’t make sense to\r\nclaim that people should prefer one to the other, or that they are\r\nsomehow equivalent. Just as self-respecting RPG fan might wish to avoid\r\na crowd of drunken nincompoops at a “Ren Fair”, a CRPG fan may have\r\naspirations beyond being “pwned” by rapacious adolescents.", 
      "There\r\nwas a point in gaming history when the CRPG was viewed as the “hard”\r\ngenre; the genre that required the largest investment in time and\r\nenergy but which offered the greatest rewards. These were games for the\r\n“hardcore,” the computer geek who was proud of her esoteric knowledge\r\nand superior intelligence. Some cynics claim that this began to change\r\nwith the increasing dominance of console RPGs, which by the late 90s\r\nwere influencing CRPGs more than the other way around (indeed, several\r\nRPGs originating on consoles were later ported to PCs, and with much\r\nsuccess). Naturally, adapting the CRPG for use on a console required\r\nmaking concessions in almost every area, particularly the interface,\r\nwhich had to be simple enough to work with a handheld controller."

      "By the second time, I was sick of the game, so I used a walkthrough to get me through it without dying. The “Magic” level consisted of a series of magic-oriented puzzles, requiring me to mix a potion, cast “Magic Wall” spells to block fireballs, cast a “Disguise” spell to turn myself into a slime and thus get under some movable walls (that was the walkthrough’s idea, anyway; I think “Zap-Away” would have also worked), and cast a series of “Knock” spells into a teleporter from various directions.", 
      "The penultimate door required me to discard my spellbook to pass. Some skulls had previously warned me something like, “your most prized possession must be left, but don’t leave yourself unprepared.” Not leaving myself unprepared involved memorizing at least one “Knock,” for the final door, before discarding my spellbook. I’m not sure I would have deciphered that without the walkthrough. In fact, I’m pretty sure that without the walkthrough, this posting would have been an obscenity-filled tirade accompanied by a picture of me standing helpless before the final door."

Over the years, I have become interested in the formal and design aspects of games more than of those other forms, probably partially because my career path has resulted in me spend so much time thinking about that.",

      "At this rate, \"Savage Empire\" is probably starting to look pretty good...", 
      "Just 13 1990 games to go!  Speaking of which, when I play with the filtering on your spreadsheet it has \"Spirit of Excalibur\" and \"Bad Blood as unplayed instead of Played - Finished and Rejected respectively.", 
      "Yes, it's a slippery slope. I had the idea when I looked at the annual index and saw that you, technically, already played a game from 1992. It's a bad coincidence that the end of 1990 is full of bad sci-fi RPGs. Though I seem to remember that Hard Nova had decent reviews.", 
      "Thirded for LA Noire. I completed the whole game and only seen, at most, 40% of the entire map. What a waste.", 
      "Noire does have an optional 'scenery' mode where you can just drive around aimlessly watching the scenery but game wise very little of the city is ever used unless you take the long rout to destinations or spend your time stealing fire trucks like I did.", 
      "I spoiled Eye of the Beholder on here awhile ago and caught some flak for it, despite it being a rather infamous ending that I'm sure any fan of the genre already knows about.", 
      "Interesting list. Regarding CRPGs, the years 1994-1996 are something of a dark age, or, to use a term from egyptian history, an intermediate period. The Gold Box games were over and Interplay's resurgence was yet to come. I wonder if the list would have included Arena or Daggerfall if it had been known in 1996 that they would begin a commercial juggernaut franchise. I mean, these years might yield positive surprises because the attention of the gaming world was elsewhere.", 
      "On the other hand, they were good years for JRPGs.", 
      "After it got fully patched, Ultima 8 was actually not bad. By Ultima standards it was god-awful, of course, but taken out of context it was an \"okay, but not great\" game. Miles better than Megatraveller. People complain so strenuously out of disappointment and frustrated expectations but Chet has played a lot of much worse games by this point.", 
      "Seeing him complain about terrible games is much more fun than straightforward playthroughs of good games.  This is the time he should regret not doing console games, because if he was doing J.R.P.G.s in the early to mid '90s, he would be playing Mother 1 and 2, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 4 and 6, Shin Megami Tensei, Zelda A Link to the Past, Gunman's Proof and have hundreds of hours of great fun, challenge and boundless imagination.", 
      "Modern times are also better for JRPGs than CRPGs:  Most of the companies in the West are producing generic shooters; the only major releases now are from the increasingly disappointing Bioware, Bethesda, The Witcher and the occasional indie game like Wasteland 2, The Binding of Isaac and The Real Texas--the latter two are awesome.  JRPGS, on the other hand have Xenoblade Chronicles and its upcoming sequel, Little King's Story, Baten Kaitos Origins, Shadow Hearts, Dragon's Dogma, Half-Minute Hero 1 and 2--which is a really original and hilarious series that is on computers, so you should play it--Dead Rising, Zelda:  Twilight Princess and A Link between Worlds:  A plethora of great R.P.G.s.",

      "Sorry, I mixed up Star Control (1990) with the more famous Star Control II (1992) in that last paragraph :/", 
      "Yes, totally. I couldn't help but thinking \"Elite\" while reading about Megatraveller. If you think about the way you progress in Elite, basically leveling up your ship, it is kind of an RPG anyway.", 
      "I like Circuit's Edge but that doesn't mean Chet's going to. It's an adventure game with RPG stats and combat glued on. And unlike Hero's Quest the puzzles are not super obvious formalities. It will try your patience for arbitrary adventure game frustration shenanigans.", 
      "I thought Circuit's Edge made a lot more sense than most adventure games of its time, I had a good time with it, loved the setting and the very well done EGA graphics. If QFG gets played, Circuit's Edge should as well.", 
      "I totally think he should play it, but while the RPG elements are well integrated it does technically fail one of his criteria, in that there's no experience / level up system... your character only improves by getting new equipment (although the fact that that equipment includes new personalities might blur the line *slightly*).", 
      "I wonder if there might have been encounters/mechanics/etc that would use some of those seemingly unused parts of this game and they were simply too obscure or poorly cued to register without out of game knowledge.", 
      "I doubt it...what usually happens is that they start with grand plans for a million statistics, then as production goes on, they get bored and refocus their attention elsewhere.  They just want to get the project over with.  If it were a personal project, they would have quit and it would have ended up as a half-finished bookcase in the garage.  But, this is a job, so they just hurriedly finish it in slipshod fashion and ship it out the door.  Then, they go on to their NEXT big idea, with TWO million statistics!", 
      "It just seemed like (from Chester's posts, at least - never played it myself) there wasn't much in this game that was intuitive.", 
      "Yeah, the part about the Amiga heads having never played an RPG before is probably correct.  I forgot *just how in love they were* with their computers.  Everything was super, spectacular.  Not that the Amiga wasn't an amazing machine, because it was.  But this type just went overboard, not because the Amiga was super, but because they were in love with *the idea* of the Amiga being super.  A game was good not because it was a good game, but because it was on the Amiga and let them gaze lovingly at the graphics.  And let's not forget the mouse-only controls, because the keyboard was a hopelessly antiquated legacy input device that was to be discarded the first chance possible.", 
      "Amiga RPG's will eventually reach maturity with Legend (AKA The four crystals of Trazere), Black Crypt and Ishar. I'm curious to read Chet's opinionn on these games. But yes, during the late 80s and early 90's, most players and reviewers were clueless about RPG, since most of them migrated from the ZX Spectrum that had hardly any games of this genre.", 
      "Ishar not on the level of the other two games you've mentioned, not by a long shot.", 
      "It's definitely worth playing Angband. There is a chronology of innovations that happens in the roguelikes, and Angband has some major ones. Whether it's worth persisting to the point of winning each is debatable, but a certain amount of save scumming will allow for the game to be experienced more linearly without the amount of restarting that a \"true\" win would require.", 
      "The Exile series? I think the question is academic. Chet might reach Exile and won't reach Avernum.", 
      "I thought Angband was a lot better than Moria.  Much brighter and more populated than Moria's desolate town and dungeons.  There were several gameplay innovations as well, which definitely made it a better game.  It's not just a Tolkien re-theming, though that is great as well.", 
      "Yeah, this game seems like a master class in learning how not to port a solid tabletop system to the computer.  It's a shame, because Traveller is a fantastic system that lends itself to procedural generation, which would seem a natural fit for the PC.", 
      "Just wanted to note my experience with Hard Nova as you'll be playing that shortly. From what I remember when I played it, you get to lead a party of adventurers in 3 different modes of playing (on foot, some kind of shuttle over a planet surface and in a spaceship). The interface is pretty hard to figure out, but it's possible to learn it without a manual (as I did). Mostly I remember the on foot combat, where once you click an enemy on screen it starts to blink, which means you have targeted it, and then you proceed to mash the fire button to make all your characters fire. This was the greatest stumbling block for me. The spaceship parts do have combat, but it's pretty fast, so I mostly avoided it. I know you said you are not looking forward to playing it, but I suggest you try and keep an open mind, as it does have some qualities of its own, and even if it's not the best game out there, it surely beats mega traveler by far.", 
      "I concur, Hard Nova is more interesting than Megatraveller, though it's almost as hard to look at - VGA primary color ramps everywhere. The people that coded Hard Nova were successful at what they set out to do, can't say the same for the unfinished mess that is Megatraveller 1", 
      "I suspect some of those reviews were bought.",

We sat down with Kevin Sullivan, the Dungeon's Taskmaster, to find out what made the group tick and why it even happened at all.",

      "The added gaming elements that Slash'EM adds to NetHack include:", 
      "Slash'EM is written in C, with its Qt windowing interface in C++. Of\ncourse, because of its NetHack lineage, the current release contains lots\nof code which the present team did not develop originally. Normally,\nincorporating code from outside a project can be a problem due to\nincompatibilities among various open source licenses, but things work\ndifferently within the NetHack family.  J. Ali Harlow, 36, a programmer\nfor the Applied Vision Research Centre of City University in London,\nEngland and one of the current maintainers of Slash'EM, says, \"There's no\nsuch problem with code that has been written to be used with NetHack. We\nseek to use the best of these whenever possible.\"", 
      "Cheung, 23, today works as a Computer Science research assistant at the\nUniversity of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia.  He says\nthat the hardest technical challenge that he surmounted in creating\nSlash'EM was the very first one: combining the Slash variant and Wizard\nPatch together.  At that point he had no knowledge of C and had never\ncompiled anything before.  His first attempt at merging the two\nfailed. About a year went by before he gave the idea another shot and,\nthat time, he got it to work. Slash'EM was born. \"Whenever I'm writing any\ncode that doesn't work,\" reflects Cheung, \"I just think back to that and\ntell myself, 'If I could make Slash'EM work without knowing anything about\nprogramming C, I can at least do this.'\"", 
      "One of the continuing technical challenges has been perfecting Slash'EM's\nproxy window interface. The concept of a proxy window interface is relatively\nsimple: the game runs as one process and the window interface runs as another,\nseparate process. They may perhaps even run on different machines.  But they\nneed to talk to each other using a mutually-understood protocol.", 
      "The next challenge for him deals with the fact that all existing window\ninterfaces have been part of the main process, and so they have had access\nto the variables and functions of the game. NetHack has a well-defined API\nfor use when the game calls window interfaces, but very little in the way\nof an API for the window interface to use when querying the game. The\nremedy for this has had to be designed from scratch.", 
      "\"The process is complicated by the fact that we need to be flexible\nenough that future window interfaces will have everything they need, but\nnot so flexible that an external window interface could be used to cheat\nwhen playing with an official binary,\" says Harlow. \"I believe I have\nachieved the latter, but I'm still a long way off achieving the\nformer.\"", 
      "The next release of Slash'EM (code-named \"Vampire\") has been in\ndevelopment for almost two years. (The Slash'EM project team is hoping to\nrelease the first beta early this year.) Some of the new features include:", 
      "Advising those who want to develop yet another flavor of NetHack or\ninterface to add to the game's family, Harlow suggests, \"Whatever you\ndecide to do, make sure that you're doing it because you enjoy it and not\njust because you think it should be done. Try and understand how long it\nis going to take you to do what you're planning, and decide if you can\nreally afford the time.  There's nothing more soul-destroying than a\nhalf-completed job.\"", 
      "Ironically, Cheung would not recommend that others attempt what he did,\nwhich was to begin by looking at the NetHack source code without prior\nknowledge of C. Things will be much easier if you're not trying to both\nfigure out the programming language and what the program is doing--this\nmight be obvious but he thinks it's worth emphasizing.", 
      "\"Start with a small modification, then work out all the ramifications,\"\nsays Cheung. \"It's amazing how everything in NetHack can interact, and the\nplayer can do almost any action with any object. So one simple addition\ncan lead to many more ideas that are interconnected. NetHack is an\namazingly complex program, and small changes can have far-reaching,\nunexpected effects.\"", 
      "Although he himself has much less time now to work on the project he\nstarted, Cheung is amazed that Slash'EM continues going so strongly in the\nopen source gaming community without his regular involvement and by how\nit's affected him personally: \"My long history with Slash'EM has led to it\nbecoming part of how I think. Whenever I'm playing a new game or watching\na movie, one of the thoughts that will invariably cross my mind is, 'This\nwould make a neat addition to Slash'EM.'\"",

This information was tabulated in a monthly column, \"Softalk Presents The Best Sellers\", which included a \"Top Thirty\" list, as well as top selling programs in several specific categories. Further, in April of each year (1981 through 1984) they presented a list of the top new programs for the previous year, as voted by Softalk readers. For the monthly compilations they contacted a sample of Apple-franchised retails stores throughout the country, and asked the store managers what programs were doing well and how many copies they were selling.  This gave somewhat more useful information than what could be learned from contacting the software companies themselves; they would only be likely to know how many copies of a program were SHIPPED, and not necessarily be relied upon to tell how many were returned unsold.  Softalk used a formula that created an index number for each program, determining its position on the Top Thirty list.  The index number also gave an indication of the relative strength of each program's sales.\r\n\r\n     Another service provided by Softalk each month, beginning in the May 1982 issue, was a column called \"Fastalk\".  Here were listed new program releases, as well as other older Apple II programs that continued to enjoy popularity and good sales.  The introduction for the column stated the following:  \"Fastalk is a quick guide to popular, specialized, new, and classic software.  When you need a particular kind of program or just want to see what's new, Fastalk is the place to look for fast answers.\"  They listed new programs with a check mark, and if it failed to gain popularity, it was dropped after three months.  A \"bullet\" marked program titles that Softalk magazine designated as a classic, \"based on its ability to stand up over time, its significance for its time (breaking new ground, or introducing a new genre), or its archetypical qualities.\"  They went on to mention that some programs listed in \"Fastalk\" were included simply because they met a need that no other software package could, even if they were not high volume sellers.\r\n\r\n     In trying to create a compendium of the best Apple II software over the years, I have relied heavily on the Softalk best seller list and their \"Fastalk\" column for the years 1980 through 1983, years for which the annual Top Thirty lists are available.  I have reproduced the annual lists for 1978-80, 1981, 1982, and 1983, both the Top Thirty and the specific lists for each category. When a program was also listed in \"Fastalk\" as a classic, or if I felt it was a unique program, I have included Softalk's capsule description in quotes with the program entry.  If I have comments of my own, they are included without quotes.\r\n\r\n     After Softalk ceased publication late in 1984, no other magazine made the same effort to keep track of such information.  Consequently, the lists of software programs for the years 1984 through 1992 are NOT going to reflect as accurately their popularity in terms of actual sales.  Rather, I had to review available copies of magazines of the time, find what programs were being advertised, and list them.  Also, if there was any program that I KNOW has done particularly well over the years, I have tried to find out when it was first released and include it as well.  Some of these programs may have additional information available listed with them that I have learned, either through my research or from personal experience.  For the sake of continuity, I elected to keep the same category names as were used by Softalk, although I have included \"Productivity\" with \"Business\", \"Hypermedia\" with \"Educational\" (originally called \"Home Education\" in Softalk), and \"Desktop Publishing\" with \"Word Processing\".  The category \"Home/Hobby\" eventually changed to \"Home\" and \"Utilities\" in the magazine, and I have made it into \"Utilities/Programming\". Probably there are better organized methods that could be used today, but this one worked for my purposes.\r\n\r\n     There are several programs that were designated in \"Fastalk\" as classics, but failed to make the annual Top Thirty lists.  I have included a description of these separately, just before the first Top Thirty list. Here I have also described the meaning of each category title.  The descriptions in quotes are directly from Softalk; the ones not in quotes are mine.\r\n\r\n     Finally, I have included the programs and hardware innovations that were honored in the 1990 and 1991 Apple II Achievement Awards ceremonies. For those of you who experienced it, enjoy the nostalgia!\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTED SOFTWARE, 1980-84\r\n\r\n** ADVENTURE **\r\n\r\n(\"Adventuresome story games in which players must deduce commands, make maps, and solve logical puzzles.\")\r\n\r\nCYBORG by Berlyn.  \"Text adventure with brief action skill game hidden in plot.

Originally published as text-only adventures for the TRS-80 computers, these were enhanced with graphics and released for the Apple II.  The \"100-color graphics\" mentioned were still single hi-res, but used \"dithering\", where dots from several colors were displayed next to each other, allowing more varied pictures.  This technique was first used by Sierra On-Line for their graphics adventures. \"Votrax vocals\" referred to an early voice synthesizer that accepted \"phoneme\" text commands and translated them into a speaking voice.\r\n\r\nSWORDTHRUST SERIES.  \"Set of adventures, seven so far [as of 1984], that integrate fantasy role playing.

Those products recognized as the best by the panel were nominated for Awards.  A panel of over 100 Apple II community members was entrusted with selecting the best of the best during balloting between March 3rd and March 27th, 1992.  Those selected receive the 1991 Apple II Achievement Award, a lead crystal disk engraved with \"1991 Apple II Excellence\" and an Apple logo on a crystal base.\r\n\r\n     The complete list of Apple II Achievement Award categories and recipients is as follows (Note: some of these were not quite available until early 1992, and therefore did not make the above list as being released in 1991):\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Freeware or Shareware:     GS-ShrinkIt (Andy Nicholas).\r\nBest Educational Software:      HyperStudio 3.1 (Roger Wagner Publishing).\r\nBest 8-bit Application:         ProTERM 3.0 (InSync Software).\r\nBest 16-bit Application:        HyperCard IIgs (Apple Computer, Inc.)\r\nBest Innovation:                Pointless (Westcode Software).\r\nBest Multimedia Achievement:    HyperStudio 3.1 (Roger Wagner Publishing).\r\nBest Utility:                   Prosel 16 (Glen Bredon)\r\nOutstanding Developer Aid:      GSBug v1.6 (Apple Computer, Inc.).\r\nBest Apple II Periodical:       A2-Central (Resource Central, Inc.).\r\nBest Online Service:  TIE:      America Online (America Online, Inc.)\r\n                                GEnie (General Electric/Resource Central,\r\n                                  Inc.)\r\nSoftware of the Year:           Apple IIGS System Software 6.0 (Apple\r\n                                  Computer)\r\n\r\n     Apple II Individual Recognition (for service of distinction to the Apple II community):  Alan Bird and Tom Weishaar.\r\n\r\n     Apple II Individual Achievement (for making the most positive impact for Apple II computer owners during the awards period):  Andy Nicholas.\r\n\r\n     Apple II Group Achievement (for making the most positive impact for Apple II computer owners during the awards period):  Apple II System Software team.\r\n\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\n\r\n                       APPENDIX B: APPLE II TIMELINE\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n     The Apple II Timeline gives an overview of many of the events mentioned in the Apple II History, as well as some others that are not discussed.  The dates given for the various entries found here are as accurate as I can make them, based on the sources cited in the bibliography that follows.  In some cases I could come no closer to the correct date than the year in which it happened.\r\n\r\n     In the case of the various versions of Apple II disk operating systems: For DOS I chose to use the date found on the HELLO program on System Masters; for ProDOS 8 I chose to use the date displayed when it starts up; and for GS/OS I chose the dates it was first announced in Open-Apple or A2-Central.  The dates they were completed and the dates they were available are sometimes several months apart.\r\n\r\n     One other thing that may make some of these dates slightly inaccurate is the difference between a product \"announcement\", \"introduction\", and \"release\". Something may be \"introduced\" on one date, but not available or \"released\" until a later date (the IBM PCjr comes to mind).  If anyone cares to correct me on any of these points, please feel free to contact me with your information source, and I will be glad to make the change.\r\n\r\n     \"Ladies and gentlemen, the History of the Apple II Time-Sweep.

Generally, the left half of the table deals with the 6502/65816 Apple II series of computers (and the closely related Apple III), and the right half deals with the 680x0 Lisa and Macintosh series.  The Mac data is more sketchy than I would like, but there have been so many new types of Macs released in the past few years that it is hard to keep track of when the new ones came out, and even more difficult to find when the old ones were discontinued.\r\n\r\n     Each year is divided up into six parts; so each horizontal tick refers to two months (Jan/Feb, Mar/Apr, etc).  For a product introduction, the line where the first part of the name appears (if it takes up more than one line) represents the date it was released.  If the discontinuation date is known, the \"===\" mark represents that date; if it is not known, the vertical line will terminate in a \"???\".\r\n\r\n     In the case of several product lines, their revisions are designated in the same vertical line since they were modifications of the existing machines, but not entirely new products.\r\n\r\n     There is no implied significance in the vertical positioning of products. Ideally, I would have liked to display each different product on a separate vertical line, but did not have enough space to fit all of that information horizontally in this format.\r\n\r\n\r\n

      "How did you first come up with the concept?", 
      "The rest kind of followed naturally from there - it seemed like a good fit for a hacking theme, then from that came concepts for the enemies, it made sense to tie acquisition to enemy spawns, and then the forced ranged attack was an idea I'd had lying around for a while that worked well with the explicitly abstract spatial representation (where nobody can complain that it's not 'realistic'). The last major piece to fall into place was to not clear enemies between levels - this was necessary to make the economy work but also added to the feeling of aphysical space.",

      "First release: July 1997", 
      "Proofread and converted to hypertext by Marko Mäkelä", 
      "This document was made to spread useful information to current\r\nusers of the Commodore VIC-20 home computer system.  It contains small\r\ntext reviews of most of the ROM-cartridge software that was ever made\r\nfor the Vic20 computing system.  (There are 180 cartridges reviewed\r\nhere!)", 
      "The purpose of this document is partly amusement and partly to help\r\nthe system's modern users to identify software that has a good chance\r\nof appealing to them, so they can check it out more for themselves.", 
      "Note that this text covers only cartridge-based software.  There\r\nwere many, many more programs once released in tape format.  However,\r\nthe author chose not to review tape-based software, for various\r\nreasons.", 
      "I've seen, over and over among all the \"classic gaming\" groups,\r\nsome form of the \"its a title on a list somewhere, and even though I\r\nhave no clue what it is or what it does, I have to own one\" mentality.\r\nIf you're rich and have ample space for all these toys, why not.  But\r\nmost of us don't fall into that category, hence the need for solid\r\ninfo.  I gave up on the idea of having \"everything\" a long time ago;\r\nsome games simply aren't worth having, from a \"will I ever play it\"\r\nstandpoint.  That goes for the Vic20, and every other gaming system\r\never made.  But there are many games that you'd love, too, if only you\r\nknew about them.", 
      "Besides, the whole \"looking through a catalog of stuff I can have\"\r\nexperience is one all of us like, to one degree or another.  And with\r\na catalog this size, you'll stay busy for quite some time, I'd say!\r\nWhy bother looking at was once available but is no longer sold, you\r\nask?  There's simple nostalgia.  Or carts to buy amongst other\r\ngamers.", 
      "But more newsworthy is that most of the Vic20's software library is\r\nnow freely available to anyone with an Internet account.  This is\r\nthanks to the hard work of a dedicated crew of Digital Archaeologists.\r\n(Paul LeBrasse and Ward Shrake did most of the finding and archiving,\r\nwith occasional help from other retrogamers on the Internet.) We made\r\nsure the Vic20 library didn't become extinct.  Then I documented it.\r\n(Fifty or a hundred years from now, I hope someone is grateful!) And\r\nso far, the copyright owners have thanked us for what we've done, too.\r\nMuch thanks goes to the people who wrote the Vic20 emulators, as\r\nwell.", 
      "Most of the information in this text file will probably remain \"as\r\nis\" for quite some time.  This is because most carts we actually had\r\nin our hands, and we don't expect our opinions to change without\r\noutside input.  However, a handful of carts we did not have at all;\r\nthe rare few carts that are presently \"vaporware\".  These may change,\r\nas we get more info.", 
      "Anyway, info about this text is included later on.  But to appease\r\nthose of you with large impatience streaks (most of you?), I put the\r\n\"fun\" stuff (reviews) next, and the explanatory stuff way in the back.\r\nThe list below is alphabetical by software title, in case you're\r\nwondering.", 
      "I do hope you will find and keep an appreciation of where our\r\ngaming hobby has already been, and where it seems to be going.  It's\r\nquite a rush, these days, what with all the different emulators and\r\nsuch; for this and all the other gaming systems. We gamers never had\r\nit better.  Enjoy the ongoing history of the audio-visual amusement\r\nexperience!", 
      "Ward F. Shrake", 
      "Below are some notes on what you can expect to find in this\r\ndocument.  It is primarily done by one person, who is doing this for\r\nhis own enjoyment.  As this is neither a co-operative group project,\r\nnor a paid project, I get to do things any way I choose to.  (Which is\r\nnice.) So, here's how I chose to do it.", 
      "Some reviews are very short, and others are much longer.  Sometimes\r\nthis just means I know more about one piece of software than another.\r\nSometimes this is a reflection of my level of interest, which may vary\r\nfrom one to another.  For the most part, they all include information\r\nwhich should enable each user to decide for themselves if they want to\r\nexplore more on their own.  (Which is all any review is really\r\nsupposed to do anyway, if you think about the process.)", 
      "I standardized certain things, and put them into a preset format.\r\nThis allows me to simplify the process somewhat, and you to read it\r\neasier.  If I can just list certain common details by their category\r\nname, for instance, I can spend more time explaining what makes one\r\npiece of software different from another.  (Which is another thing\r\nthat a review is supposed to be useful for, right?)  I suppose you\r\ncould think of it as being in an ASCII database format, sort of.", 
      "I had some fun including historical information, for lack of a\r\nbetter term.  I know that many younger gamers never saw the eight foot\r\ntall \"real\" version of Battlezone, when it was new to the arcades, for\r\ninstance. So, stuff like that I tried to include.  Or that some of the\r\nfun of a game like Sea Wolf, when it was new in the arcades, was the\r\nfancy cabinetry.  It allowed you to pretend you were in a submarine,\r\nby using a real-looking periscope to look through and to fire torpedos\r\nwith.  These things are not obvious; without knowing about them from\r\nsome outside source, you'd never guess them just from seeing a\r\nprograms output on a TV or monitor.  So, I included lots of stuff like\r\nthat.  I hope it is interesting to you.  (Enjoy!) I tried to keep in\r\nmind that users could be from two main schools of thought on this;\r\nolder arcaders trying to relive the glory days through finding good\r\nhome versions of their old favorites, as well as younger home game\r\nenthusiasts who perhaps have no idea what there was to be excited\r\nabout, back in those \"good old days\" of gaming's infancy!", 
      "So without further adieu, let's explain what each category means to\r\nyou...", 
      "This is where the title of each cartridge goes.\r\nSelf-explanatory.", 
      "This is the spot for the name of the company that made the game.\r\nAlso listed here will be the company's item model number, if any.", 
      "In cases where more than one company worked on a particular game,\r\nthe company that actually mass-produced or distributed the actual\r\nitem is listed first, followed by whomever they licensed it from.\r\nSoftware licensing was quite common in this time period, and it gets\r\nconfusing from time to time.  (Internal clues are recently making me\r\nwonder if it didn't go on more than we know of, too.  In other words,\r\nusually a company made it themselves but maybe not.  Commodore may\r\nhave simply purchased half of \"their\" own carts.)", 
      "This is the spot used to show who actually programmed this piece\r\nof software and what year it was made.  This information is most\r\nlikely from either the cartridge's label or some onscreen text.\r\nFailing that, catalogs, box art and similar sources were used.", 
      "In cases where author or date information remain unclear, I fill\r\nit in with \"unknown\" or \"198_\" as a placeholder and reminder.  We\r\nreally made an extreme effort to fill these things in.  However,\r\nsome people assumed everyone then knew who was doing something so\r\nthey never make a strong effort to actually write that info down.", 
      "If you think you know who wrote a title, please contact us.  We\r\nsee this as an art form. We want to know who these artists were.", 
      "Dates in general can be a pain in the butt to determine with any\r\ntype of pinpoint accuracy.  Generally, you are lucky to get any type\r\nof onscreen dating. When you do, it will sometimes conflict with what\r\nthe box art says.  And in some extreme circumstances, both of these\r\nconflict with messages found inside the games code! Or their dating\r\nmessages all agree, but then the cart doesn't fit into a logical\r\nsequence once you begin to consider the company's part number series.\r\nStill, I did the best I could do, for now.", 
      "All in all, I don't envy historians doing dating for a\r\nliving!", 
      "Sometimes other sources of information -- magazines, text hidden\r\ninside blocks of internal codes, etc -- can be used to determine who\r\nthe artists were.  Until a positive determination is made and\r\nconfirmed, this information may temporarily be listed elsewhere.  At\r\nthis point, my own sources of information are pretty dried up.", 
      "Disgusted at the overwhelming lack of onscreen credits given by\r\nmost major gaming companies, I took it upon myself to dig deep into\r\nthe actual hexadecimal game code itself, searching for any clues or\r\nconfirmations of such clues.  Sure enough, a number of carts had\r\nauthor information tucked away inside, away from the view of most\r\ngamers. (And presumably, their bosses at the time!)", 
      "When I found something interesting, I list it below in Trivia.  I\r\nhaven't checked each cart with CBM ASCII yet; just standard ASCII.\r\nMaybe one day searches for Graphic Characters will add more here?\r\nPlaying with hex editors also changed many memory size notes too.", 
      "Individual dates shown for each piece helps interested parties to\r\nsee the growth of an artist over the evolution of their careers.\r\nAlso, to more readily see the growth of the industry as a whole and\r\nto see the effects of a cross-pollination of ideas over time.  Which\r\nis why I've gone to all the trouble to find these things.", 
      "A brief idea of what type of software this cartridge is.  In the\r\nmajority of cases this is some sort of videogame, but a handful\r\nof utility cartridges did exist. (Utilities are listed as such.)", 
      "If a particular piece of Vic20 software is essentially a copy of\r\na game that originated in the video arcade market, it usually got\r\ntreated differently in these reviews.  That is, in addition to my\r\nefforts to describe what it looks and feels like on the Vic20, I\r\ntried to compare the two versions; to see if it was a \"good\" copy of\r\nthe original.  The Vic20 has definite hardware limits, so some things\r\nare more forgivable than others, but I feel the reviews are fair and\r\nhonest.  A bad copy is still a bad copy, after all.", 
      "A few terms are used to indicate differences in heritage.  But to\r\nmake sure the lineage can easily be traced, I did go to pains to\r\nmention the names of the arcade original, in cases were two names\r\nwere used.  If a name appearing here is listed in quotes, that is an\r\nindication that I'm refering to an arcade game as an ancestor.", 
      "The word \"clone\" means a piece is obvious to knowledgeable persons\r\nto be a copy based on a previous work.  Whether that copy was an\r\nauthorized one or not is usually noted if it can be determined.", 
      "Unauthorized, copy-cat clones happened frequently in the gaming\r\nindustry then, and they still do.  Witness the explosion of the Space\r\nInvaders or Pac-Man genres, back when, or the multitude of Street\r\nFighter clones now.  Imagination and creativity are rare in corporate\r\ngaming establishments; in the hippyish culture that was in charge of\r\ngaming before the crash, there was more of it, IMO.", 
      "A \"translation\" is an attempt to convincingly duplicate the main\r\nfeatures of a much more powerful coin-operated arcade machine of the\r\ntime, using a much less powerful home computer.  Results vary.  This\r\nterm generally denotes it is an authorized attempt, anyway.", 
      "The word \"variant\" indicates that while it may be obvious which\r\nprevious work this effort was based on, there are enough changes to\r\nthe original idea to consider this piece as a separate entity.  This\r\ncould be an attempt to avoid copyright infringement, while still\r\nmaking a generally similar game.  Or an attempt to revive a\r\nonce-popular \"formula\" by adding gimmicks.  Or it could just be a step\r\nalong the evolutionary ladder: gaming's or a programmer's.", 
      "The word \"original\" simply means that the author does not know of\r\nany single previous work that this piece is largely based on.  It goes\r\nwithout saying, however, that the entire body of previous art always\r\naffects and influences all art that follows it.", 
      "This is where you look to see how much additional memory will be\r\nrequired to run this software.  This is helpful if you are running a\r\ncopy of a cartridge's ROM memory (called a ROM image) within some sort\r\nof RAM expansion, in an actual Vic-20 computer system.", 
      "This section also tells you what controllers to use, too; whether a\r\njoystick works, a set of paddle controllers, or whatever.", 
      "Memory may be a moot point if you are using an emulated Vic20.\r\n(For instance, the \"PC Vic\" emulation software that I use on my IBM\r\ncompatible sets up each game's memory automatically.  Most ROM images\r\nwork fine with it, and most of my comments throughout this document\r\nare references to that one particular emulator.)", 
      "However, keep in mind that this is important information if you\r\nwish to view or use a ROM image within RAM.  You cannot run a 16k\r\nsoftware cartridge image in only 8k of expansion RAM, any more than\r\nyou can put 16 gallons of water into an 8 gallon container.", 
      "The most trouble-free memory configuration to have on a real Vic\r\nsystem is a full 32k of RAM expansion; you can run anything then.\r\nSecond best is a 16k RAM expander that has small switches on it that\r\nallow you to put two 8k banks wherever you need to put them to run a\r\nparticular piece of software.  Third best are multiple 8k RAM\r\nexpansion cartridges fitted into an \"expansion chassis\" board.\r\nWithout at least one 8k RAM expander, you cannot use ROM images.", 
      "Technically-inclined person should also note that the RAM memory\r\nspace is always shown as being rounded up to the nearest 8k.  This is\r\nbecause 8k is, for all reasonable intents, the smallest single amount\r\nof memory that can be used.  In other words, the companies that made a\r\ncartridge game may have only used 4k of ROM or EPROM memory; however,\r\nto play it back, you still need 8k of RAM. This is mostly of interest\r\nto hacker types, not to the average gamer.", 
      "For more technical information, please see the VIC-20 Gamer's FAQ\r\nor one of the other documents to be found on the Internet.", 
      "These four ratings categories are used to tell you a little about\r\nthe software itself.  These are subjective remarks; in other words,\r\njust my opinion.  One person wrote all these reviews, with just a\r\nlittle outside shoulder-surfing.  If nothing else this should lead to\r\nconsistency from review to review, which is a good thing.", 
      "Recognition of reviewer bias should be pretty clear.  I tend to\r\nlike fast-paced, intense action games best... games like the arcade\r\nversions of Asteroids, Defender and Robotron really appeal to me.  But\r\nI also like slower, simpler \"cute\" games at times.", 
      "I think what I like most in the games I love best, is a sense of\r\nhighly polished \"one-ness\"; a single-mindedness of purpose.  The game\r\nexists for one reason, whatever it is, and that's enough.  I believe\r\nthis was easier to achieve, back in the days when games were made by a\r\nsingle person, and not by a corporate committee.", 
      "And except for games made by Xonox, I feel I've been consistently\r\nfair.  Then again, Xonox has a bad reputation throughout retrogaming, for all\r\nthe classic systems, so maybe I've been fairer than I think.", 
      "Generally, the sound on most Vic20 programs is nothing to brag\r\nabout.  The very limited sound capabilities of the machine itself are\r\nat fault; it could do \"Atari 2600\" console style bleeps and simple\r\neffects well, but that was all it was designed for.  If you see I've\r\nrated a game's sound as \"average\" then consider it to be no better or\r\nworse than sounds you'd expect to hear on a 2600.  (\"Average or\r\nbetter\" may mean compared to Activision games, not the earlier efforts\r\nthat Atari themselves made.) Is this a cop out? Not really.  This\r\nsaves us both some time and effort.  And if there isn't much of an\r\naudible difference between systems, why claim there is? Besides, we've\r\nall heard the Atari 2600 before.", 
      "I may skip these categories entirely, for educational titles.  The\r\nsame goes with word processors and the like.  These are usually no\r\ncomparison to entertainment games anyway, in terms of graphics, so I\r\ndon't think the comparison would be a fair, informative one.  With\r\nthese (rarer) titles, you have to take what is available; if the other\r\ncategories make it sound interesting, go check it out.  (And don't\r\nexpect much from word processors with only 22 screen columns across,\r\nand with about enough memory to edit postcards!)", 
      "Keep in mind that no review is an absolute.  They are made just to\r\ngive you a baseline to start on.  If it sounds like something you want\r\nto see, then by all means, go check it out on your own.", 
      "This section quotes the text of advertisements that the company\r\nonce had printed.  This is included in part to offset my/our own\r\npossible biases.  But it also serves a more interesting function, in\r\nhaving the makers describe their works in their own words.", 
      "Including this should show you what the company wanted \"you\" to\r\nknow about the product they were attempting to sell to the gaming\r\npublic at the time.  The text source of each quoted ad is listed, but\r\nnote that the same ad may have run in other places as well.  If I had\r\nmore text resources available to me, I'd include more.  (Sending\r\nphotocopies of ads to me would be appreciated, BTW.)", 
      "This section quotes industry reviews of the time, to show what\r\ncontemporary experts thought of each piece.  In some cases, this will\r\nclosely match what the makers had said.  In other cases, it does not.\r\nHopefully, this gives you an overall impression of the quality of each\r\npiece, both promised and actually observed.  I hope these two together\r\nfunction as a check-and-balance system.  (Besides, the reviews are\r\nalso a part of the software's history.)  All sources are\r\nidentified.  Multiple reviews are encouraged.", 
      "This section is used to record anything that the reviewer feels is\r\nimportant or of possible historical interest.  Some of these things\r\nare already passing from even expert knowledge, let alone public\r\nknowledge, and I feel it is important to preserve them.", 
      "Sometimes programmers \"hid\" coded comments internally; either their\r\nown names as authors, messages to their fans, whatever.  I have\r\nincluded all these I've found so far, and plan to keep on looking\r\nthrough the internal codes to find more, later on.  (If you find\r\nsomething I've missed, we'll be interested in hearing!)", 
      "This was often the \"fun stuff\", as far as I was concerned when I\r\nwrote all these reviews.  (Hadda have something to keep me going!)\r\nOnce the \"digging up\" process is finished, and all the obvious facts\r\nabout an object are cataloged, the next logical step for a Digital\r\nArchaeologist is to start playing detective, so at least for my own\r\namusement, that's what I imagine I'll be doing next.",

In general, most games can be\r\nused without actually having the instructions, but this may not be the\r\ncase with specialized hardware.  This list does not attempt to detail\r\nhow to actually use each and every device.  Sorry.  However, this list\r\ndoes tell you what expansion RAM memory you will need to run each of\r\nthe reviewed items and where that expansion must be located.  It also\r\nnotes what input device (keyboard, joystick, etc) you must use.  If\r\nsomething is obviously non-intuitive, I try to explain what to do, at\r\nleast enough to get you started on exploring things more on your\r\nown.", 
      "I don't have concrete plans for a second edition at this point.  I\r\nmay just plan to collect whatever comes in, store it a while, and put\r\nout maybe one major update with everything in it... depending on\r\noverall input.  Things like photocopies of ads would be nice to have.\r\nIf you have copies of any info that is not listed here, then by all\r\nmeans send me a photocopy of it! My snail mail address is as below;\r\nplease don't abuse it.  Ward Shrake, PO Box 4699, Covina, CA USA\r\n91723-4699.",

      "And where else could I find such virgin writing territory, among\r\nthe \"classic era\" game machines? The others were deemed to be \"no\r\nfun\", writing-wise, as they were all fairly well documented.  So I\r\nsuppose I owe Commodore themselves a hearty thanks for two things.\r\nFirst, for putting the Vic20 on the market.  Then for killing its\r\nmarket off so efficiently that almost everyone forgot all about\r\nit!", 
      "And kudos again to all those people I mentioned in the Vic20 gamers\r\nFAQ.  Thanks to all who encouraged us, sold/traded carts, or were just\r\nplain friendly and supportive of our Vic20 rescue operations.  Paul\r\nand I appreciated every kindness done to us.  All of us benefitted\r\nfrom it; all those ROM images had to come from somewhere.  Even if we\r\nhad to pay out of our pockets for most carts, still, others located\r\nthem for us.", 
      "Other \"Classic\" computing and/or gaming systems have their\r\nfollowing, too.  In fact, most of the organization of this document\r\nwas based on ideas the author got while searching out information on\r\nother gaming systems.  The software reviews done for the TurboGrafx 16\r\nsystem, for instance, are extremely well done.  I made this document\r\nafter seeing what BT Garner and others had done with the TurboGrafx\r\nlibrary.  I owe them a debt, in as much as their reviews helped me to\r\nfind some TG16 software I really liked, with minimal effort.  After\r\nseeing how useful their information was, I wanted to make a similar\r\neffort for the VIC.", 
      "No good reason as to why.  I just wanted to do it, and say that I\r\ndid.  Again, maybe someone will think this is pretty neat 50 years\r\nfrom now.  I like that idea! Jeff Minter has said he likes having his\r\nVic20 games available to anyone, for all time, now that they're\r\narchived.  So do I.

      "The purpose of this document is partly amusement and partly to help\nthe system's modern users to identify software that has a good chance\nof appealing to them, so they can check it out more for themselves.", 
      "Note that this text covers only cartridge-based software.  There\nwere many, many more programs once released in tape format.  However,\nthe author chose not to review tape-based software, for various\nreasons.",

But\nmost of us don't fall into that category, hence the need for solid\ninfo.  I gave up on the idea of having \"everything\" a long time ago;\nsome games simply aren't worth having, from a \"will I ever play it\"\nstandpoint.  That goes for the VIC-20, and every other gaming system\never made.  But there are many games that you'd love, too, if only you\nknew about them.", 
      "Besides, the whole \"looking through a catalog of stuff I can have\"\nexperience is one all of us like, to one degree or another.  And with\na catalog this size, you'll stay busy for quite some time, I'd say!\nWhy bother looking at was once available but is no longer sold, you\nask?  There's simple nostalgia.  Or carts to buy amongst other\ngamers.",

This is\nthanks to the hard work of a dedicated crew of Digital Archaeologists.\n(Paul LeBrasse and Ward Shrake did most of the finding and archiving,\nwith occasional help from other retrogamers on the Internet.)

Sometimes\nthis just means I know more about one piece of software than another.\nSometimes this is a reflection of my level of interest, which may vary\nfrom one to another.

(Which is all any review is really\nsupposed to do anyway, if you think about the process.)", 
      "I standardized certain things, and put them into a preset format.\nThis allows me to simplify the process somewhat, and you to read it\neasier.  If I can just list certain common details by their category\nname, for instance, I can spend more time explaining what makes one\npiece of software different from another.  (Which is another thing\nthat a review is supposed to be useful for, right?)  I suppose you\ncould think of it as being in an ASCII database format, sort of.", 
      "I had some fun including historical information, for lack of a\nbetter term.  I know that many younger gamers never saw the eight foot\ntall \"real\" version of Battlezone, when it was new to the arcades, for\ninstance. So, stuff like that I tried to include.  Or that some of the\nfun of a game like Sea Wolf, when it was new in the arcades, was the\nfancy cabinetry.  It allowed you to pretend you were in a submarine,\nby using a real-looking periscope to look through and to fire torpedos\nwith.  These things are not obvious; without knowing about them from\nsome outside source, you'd never guess them just from seeing a\nprograms output on a TV or monitor.  So, I included lots of stuff like\nthat.  I hope it is interesting to you.  (Enjoy!) I tried to keep in\nmind that users could be from two main schools of thought on this;\nolder arcaders trying to relive the glory days through finding good\nhome versions of their old favorites, as well as younger home game\nenthusiasts who perhaps have no idea what there was to be excited\nabout, back in those \"good old days\" of gaming's infancy!",

      "In cases where more than one company worked on a particular game,\nthe company that actually mass-produced or distributed the actual\nitem is listed first, followed by whomever they licensed it from.\nSoftware licensing was quite common in this time period, and it gets\nconfusing from time to time.  (Internal clues are recently making me\nwonder if it didn't go on more than we know of, too.  In other words,\nusually a company made it themselves but maybe not.  Commodore may\nhave simply purchased half of \"their\" own carts.)", 
      "This is the spot used to show who actually programmed this piece\nof software and what year it was made.  This information is most\nlikely from either the cartridge's label or some onscreen text.\nFailing that, catalogs, box art and similar sources were used.", 
      "In cases where author or date information remain unclear, I fill\nit in with \"unknown\" or \"198_\" as a placeholder and reminder.  We\nreally made an extreme effort to fill these things in.  However,\nsome people assumed everyone then knew who was doing something so\nthey never make a strong effort to actually write that info down.",

      "Dates in general can be a pain in the butt to determine with any\ntype of pinpoint accuracy.  Generally, you are lucky to get any type\nof onscreen dating. When you do, it will sometimes conflict with what\nthe box art says.  And in some extreme circumstances, both of these\nconflict with messages found inside the games code! Or their dating\nmessages all agree, but then the cart doesn't fit into a logical\nsequence once you begin to consider the company's part number series.\nStill, I did the best I could do, for now.", 
      "All in all, I don't envy historians doing dating for a\nliving!", 
      "Sometimes other sources of information -- magazines, text hidden\ninside blocks of internal codes, etc -- can be used to determine who\nthe artists were.  Until a positive determination is made and\nconfirmed, this information may temporarily be listed elsewhere.  At\nthis point, my own sources of information are pretty dried up.", 
      "Disgusted at the overwhelming lack of onscreen credits given by\nmost major gaming companies, I took it upon myself to dig deep into\nthe actual hexadecimal game code itself, searching for any clues or\nconfirmations of such clues.  Sure enough, a number of carts had\nauthor information tucked away inside, away from the view of most\ngamers. (And presumably, their bosses at the time!)", 
      "When I found something interesting, I list it below in Trivia.  I\nhaven't checked each cart with CBM ASCII yet; just standard ASCII.\nMaybe one day searches for Graphic Characters will add more here?\nPlaying with hex editors also changed many memory size notes too.", 
      "Individual dates shown for each piece helps interested parties to\nsee the growth of an artist over the evolution of their careers.\nAlso, to more readily see the growth of the industry as a whole and\nto see the effects of a cross-pollination of ideas over time.

The VIC-20 has definite hardware limits, so some things\nare more forgivable than others, but I feel the reviews are fair and\nhonest.  A bad copy is still a bad copy, after all.",

But to\nmake sure the lineage can easily be traced, I did go to pains to\nmention the names of the arcade original, in cases were two names\nwere used.  If a name appearing here is listed in quotes, that is an\nindication that I'm refering to an arcade game as an ancestor.",

      "Memory may be a moot point if you are using an emulated VIC-20.\n(For instance, the \"PC Vic\" emulation software that I use on my IBM\ncompatible sets up each game's memory automatically.  Most ROM images\nwork fine with it, and most of my comments throughout this document\nare references to that one particular emulator.)", 
      "However, keep in mind that this is important information if you\nwish to view or use a ROM image within RAM.  You cannot run a 16k\nsoftware cartridge image in only 8k of expansion RAM, any more than\nyou can put 16 gallons of water into an 8 gallon container.", 
      "The most trouble-free memory configuration to have on a real Vic\nsystem is a full 32k of RAM expansion; you can run anything then.\nSecond best is a 16k RAM expander that has small switches on it that\nallow you to put two 8k banks wherever you need to put them to run a\nparticular piece of software.  Third best are multiple 8k RAM\nexpansion cartridges fitted into an \"expansion chassis\" board.\nWithout at least one 8k RAM expander, you cannot use ROM images.", 
      "Technically-inclined person should also note that the RAM memory\nspace is always shown as being rounded up to the nearest 8k.  This is\nbecause 8k is, for all reasonable intents, the smallest single amount\nof memory that can be used.  In other words, the companies that made a\ncartridge game may have only used 4k of ROM or EPROM memory; however,\nto play it back, you still need 8k of RAM. This is mostly of interest\nto hacker types, not to the average gamer.",

      "Recognition of reviewer bias should be pretty clear.  I tend to\nlike fast-paced, intense action games best... games like the arcade\nversions of Asteroids, Defender and Robotron really appeal to me.  But\nI also like slower, simpler \"cute\" games at times.", 
      "I think what I like most in the games I love best, is a sense of\nhighly polished \"one-ness\"; a single-mindedness of purpose.  The game\nexists for one reason, whatever it is, and that's enough.  I believe\nthis was easier to achieve, back in the days when games were made by a\nsingle person, and not by a corporate committee.", 
      "And except for games made by Xonox, I feel I've been consistently\nfair.  Then again, Xonox has a bad reputation throughout retrogaming, for all\nthe classic systems, so maybe I've been fairer than I think.", 
      "Generally, the sound on most VIC-20 programs is nothing to brag\nabout.  The very limited sound capabilities of the machine itself are\nat fault; it could do \"Atari 2600\" console style bleeps and simple\neffects well, but that was all it was designed for.  If you see I've\nrated a game's sound as \"average\" then consider it to be no better or\nworse than sounds you'd expect to hear on a 2600.  (\"Average or\nbetter\" may mean compared to Activision games, not the earlier efforts\nthat Atari themselves made.) Is this a cop out? Not really.  This\nsaves us both some time and effort.  And if there isn't much of an\naudible difference between systems, why claim there is? Besides, we've\nall heard the Atari 2600 before.", 
      "I may skip these categories entirely, for educational titles.  The\nsame goes with word processors and the like.  These are usually no\ncomparison to entertainment games anyway, in terms of graphics, so I\ndon't think the comparison would be a fair, informative one.  With\nthese (rarer) titles, you have to take what is available; if the other\ncategories make it sound interesting, go check it out.  (And don't\nexpect much from word processors with only 22 screen columns across,\nand with about enough memory to edit postcards!)", 
      "Keep in mind that no review is an absolute.  They are made just to\ngive you a baseline to start on.  If it sounds like something you want\nto see, then by all means, go check it out on your own.", 
      "This section quotes the text of advertisements that the company\nonce had printed.  This is included in part to offset my/our own\npossible biases.  But it also serves a more interesting function, in\nhaving the makers describe their works in their own words.", 
      "Including this should show you what the company wanted \"you\" to\nknow about the product they were attempting to sell to the gaming\npublic at the time.  The text source of each quoted ad is listed, but\nnote that the same ad may have run in other places as well.  If I had\nmore text resources available to me, I'd include more.  (Sending\nphotocopies of ads to me would be appreciated, BTW.)", 
      "This section quotes industry reviews of the time, to show what\ncontemporary experts thought of each piece.  In some cases, this will\nclosely match what the makers had said.  In other cases, it does not.\nHopefully, this gives you an overall impression of the quality of each\npiece, both promised and actually observed.  I hope these two together\nfunction as a check-and-balance system.  (Besides, the reviews are\nalso a part of the software's history.)  All sources are\nidentified.  Multiple reviews are encouraged.", 
      "This section is used to record anything that the reviewer feels is\nimportant or of possible historical interest.  Some of these things\nare already passing from even expert knowledge, let alone public\nknowledge, and I feel it is important to preserve them.", 
      "Sometimes programmers \"hid\" coded comments internally; either their\nown names as authors, messages to their fans, whatever.  I have\nincluded all these I've found so far, and plan to keep on looking\nthrough the internal codes to find more, later on.  (If you find\nsomething I've missed, we'll be interested in hearing!)", 
      "This was often the \"fun stuff\", as far as I was concerned when I\nwrote all these reviews.  (Hadda have something to keep me going!)\nOnce the \"digging up\" process is finished, and all the obvious facts\nabout an object are cataloged, the next logical step for a Digital\nArchaeologist is to start playing detective, so at least for my own\namusement, that's what I imagine I'll be doing next.", 
      "Can sometimes be used to augment the Trivia section, but is meant\nmore for explaining things that you might need to know to run a\nparticular title.  Use of non-standard controls, blah, blah...", 
      "Note that cartridge-based VIC-20 programs are usually games.  A\nsmall amount of non-game software does exist in cartridge format as\nwell, for various specialized purposes.  In general, most games can be\nused without actually having the instructions, but this may not be the\ncase with specialized hardware.  This list does not attempt to detail\nhow to actually use each and every device.  Sorry.  However, this list\ndoes tell you what expansion RAM memory you will need to run each of\nthe reviewed items and where that expansion must be located.  It also\nnotes what input device (keyboard, joystick, etc) you must use.  If\nsomething is obviously non-intuitive, I try to explain what to do, at\nleast enough to get you started on exploring things more on your\nown.", 
      "I don't have concrete plans for a second edition at this point.  I\nmay just plan to collect whatever comes in, store it a while, and put\nout maybe one major update with everything in it... depending on\noverall input.  Things like photocopies of ads would be nice to have.\nIf you have copies of any info that is not listed here, then by all\nmeans send me a photocopy of it! My snail mail address is as below;\nplease don't abuse it.  Ward Shrake, PO Box 4699, Covina, CA USA\n91723-4699.", 
      "This text was written all by my lonesome: just Ward Shrake.  Yes, I\nmust be nuts to type all this.  Sue me.  I had fun doing it, usually.", 
      "And where else could I find such virgin writing territory, among\nthe \"classic era\" game machines? The others were deemed to be \"no\nfun\", writing-wise, as they were all fairly well documented.  So I\nsuppose I owe Commodore themselves a hearty thanks for two things.\nFirst, for putting the VIC-20 on the market.  Then for killing its\nmarket off so efficiently that almost everyone forgot all about\nit!", 
      "And kudos again to all those people I mentioned in the VIC-20 gamers\nFAQ.  Thanks to all who encouraged us, sold/traded carts, or were just\nplain friendly and supportive of our VIC-20 rescue operations.  Paul\nand I appreciated every kindness done to us.  All of us benefitted\nfrom it; all those ROM images had to come from somewhere.  Even if we\nhad to pay out of our pockets for most carts, still, others located\nthem for us.", 
      "Other \"Classic\" computing and/or gaming systems have their\nfollowing, too.  In fact, most of the organization of this document\nwas based on ideas the author got while searching out information on\nother gaming systems.  The software reviews done for the TurboGrafx 16\nsystem, for instance, are extremely well done.  I made this document\nafter seeing what BT Garner and others had done with the TurboGrafx\nlibrary.  I owe them a debt, in as much as their reviews helped me to\nfind some TG16 software I really liked, with minimal effort.  After\nseeing how useful their information was, I wanted to make a similar\neffort for the VIC.", 
      "No good reason as to why.  I just wanted to do it, and say that I\ndid.  Again, maybe someone will think this is pretty neat 50 years\nfrom now.  I like that idea! Jeff Minter has said he likes having his\nVIC-20 games available to anyone, for all time, now that they're\narchived.  So do I.  (Anyone that has taken as many art history\nclasses as I have recently could probably see my point on this.) It's\njust neat.  So why not?

Their assessment is more inclined to be objective and independent than the person trying to sell the software; is more likely to be founded on a professional understanding of students' capabilities, needs and preferences; and is more probably based on an authentic classroom experience of the use of a particular software package. Nonetheless, such evaluation is not (and does not pretend to be) a rigorous study under research conditions.",

Aims, goals and objectives are targets for performance, and no package will provide the same learning experiences for every child.

There is also a matter of degree - if it is possible that a particular adventure game might present some unacceptable attitudes, but is otherwise exemplary, ought it to be used? Could the unacceptable attitudes usefully be presented as teaching points?", 
      "The use of an adventure game in the classroom cannot be legitimated without research into its viability compared to other instructional media.

      "Also Dragonflight, which was their first RPG. There's a few easter eggs and references to it in Amberstar/Ambermoon and Albion, but they don't have much in common beyond that.", 
      "Also, you should note that handheld version of both Mario Tennis and Mario Golf contain really meaty jRPG single player campaigns, with random fights replaced by golf/tennis matches, so it's not that surprising to see them there.", 
      "Yeah, the Pokemon games are clearly JRPGs, and I'm generally of the opinion that JRPGs are clearly RPGs, even if they emphasize different things.", 
      "Yeah, that comment is a bit puzzling. I assume the \"Super Robot\" games are mostly including Banpresto's \"Wars\" series, and those play similarly to titles such as Shining Force, and qualify at least in the same sense Sword of Aragon did on the blog.",

      "Commodore should have included an hard drive in all its models since 92 or something. I played monkey island 2 until the end and the game came in 11 disks!!Also, two buttons joysticks should also mandatory. Very few developers have the option to play with 2 button joysticks and that's a shame. It's a slight detail that made many Amiga conversions inferior to the 16 bits consoles.", 
      "Heh, I almost wrote that exact same thing yesterday - an Amiga 1200 with a HDD (it already had an IDE controller for chrissakes!) would have been huge.",

      "For me the best way to play amiga games is with Gamebase and Whdload together. It's basically like playing with console roms. Everything is instant.",

      "I see now it's not quite double, and you'll catch up on the backlog shortly before the end of game year 1992.", 
      "Yes, it wasn't quite double. I went from having about 600 games before 2003 to a little over 800. In the process of regenerating the list, I dumped a bunch of Asian titles for Windows that never had English translations.", 
      "Damn. I got all excited to play a Batman RPG.",

      "And now that I think about it, there are a lot of Spectrum games that have the same amount of RPG elements as Heavy on the Magick. Such as the Magic Knight series (Spellbound, Knight Tyme, Stormbringer). They do have some character attributes (strength, stamina..) and inventory, but if there's any combat...it's based on solving item puzzles, etc. I'd pigeonhole those as graphic adventures.", 
      "YAAAAY!! No, really, this GREAT news :-) So that might add a lot to your list, but hey, as many said before, the most interesting posts were those of the more unknown games. And there are a lot of these to be discovered on the c64, amiga, atari st, etc.", 
      "Just curious,  does this mean you'll reconsider a game of the year winner,  if you come across a possible contender on the revised list?", 
      "Yes, I imagine I would do that.", 
      "Ah, I see now that they are in the list, but hidden. Every time I searched for one of those titles it just wouldn't find it. Seems since I opened it from Drive it automatically opens in spreadsheet  view. Once I switched to List view they're there plain as day.", 
      "It's probably a waste of time to tell me that a game isn't an RPG now. The list isn't necessarily a list of all the games I'll play; just all the games that anyone THINKS are RPGs that meet my platform criteria. I'll apply my own standards when I get to them and reject them if necessary. If you have strong opinions about the RPG-ness of a game, it makes the most sense to bring it up when it's close on my \"upcoming\" list.",

      "Yes, there's no \"contains\" filter in the Google spreadsheet. You have to download that to Excel if you want to do that.",

      "How did the 1990 list get reshuffled?", 
      "I realized the \"release dates\" I had used to determine the original order were all based on unfounded speculations. Also, I replaced the list before I noted what order the original had been in. So I shuffled them randomly and created a new order. There wasn't anything I particularly loved about the old one, so I let it stand.", 
      "I had pretty much the same experience as HunterZ, except that I got scared completely off that series. And I really wanted to like it, having played in a brief D&D game online with a mostly German group, with the game being based in the DSA setting.",

      "One more item I don't understand. Roadwar Europa is on the list, but its predecessor Roadwar 2000 (1986) is not. They are virtually the same in many ways. I am not sure either qualifies as an RPG. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadwar_2000", 
      "Never played it, so you'll have to tell me.", 
      "You know what? I'm going to add it. Only because I played it once when I was a kid and I remember liking it.",

      "That looks like a hack that bundles the NES rom with an emulator.",

      "I'm not so interested in making political distinctions with that column so much as cultural and linguistic ones.", 
      "Oh, I should probably change it. It's just a pain in the neck to figure out which is which.", 
      "Yes, you should do that. There's a huge gap in creativity between the two that cannot be ignored.", 
      "Lords of Chaos was one of my favourite ever games for a long time so I feel qualified to add my two cents here. I would call it a strategy game too, but it certainly has elements of rpg, like an inventory and being able to control your character. There is character development but only at the end of levels and there is only 3/6 of them (depending on if you can get your hands on the rather rare expansion (I have a copy of it for the amiga I think)). It's in a similar vein to laser squad if you ever played that, it excels in multiplayer hotseat mode. Good memories of burning down pretty much the entire first map in revenge for the mischevious elephants and the fear of starting a turn to find one psychopathic dwarf had slaughtered several demons and was still out there -somewhere-. The independant creatures were actually normally more dangerous than the enemy wizard. There is a quick where on some platforms you could not move your wizard during the first turn (mostly just confusing if you are not used to it and load it up on the emulator and wonder why you can't move). There are no proper npcs and I think the story for the levels is only a paragraph or two in the manual, I'd still say if you can play pirates you can play this however ;)", 
      "Thanks. I'll keep them in mind for any Asian games that I REALLY want to check out, but I'm afraid I'm not going to add hundreds of more games to my list just because this is available, especially when (as Kenny points out), the translations aren't very good. Literal translations hardly ever are.", 
      "The translation seems to convey the meaning of the text well enough IMO.  Perhaps the dialogue is not as idiomatic as it might be, though.", 
      "While I really liked the game, Darkmere is no RPG, but an action-adventure. Except for energy it has no stats whatsoever.", 
      "Is it a straight port of the arcade games?", 
      "Unfortunately, games that were designed for consoles, only available for Windows because they're bundled with console emulators, don't qualify.", 
      "Aww, come on! It's on Steam! A direct Arcade-To-PC conversion! Absolutely no emulators included!", 
      "Well, it does appear that I misunderstood what the game was. All right, I'll add it to the list for 1993. If it was based on an arcade game, it can't possibly take that long to play.", 
      "Yeah. Just a couple of hours, really. XD", 
      "I have to say I think this change in direction is a positive thing, too.  While it can be interesting to read your take on games I've played, I really enjoy finding out about minor games I've never heard of, and games I'm not likely ever to play.  I look forward to hearing more about old games for non-DOS systems.", 
      "As a fan of the Super Robot Wars series, I can verify that none of the games are RPGs beyond the fact that characters gain levels."

    "http://www.siliconera.com/2008/02/27/chunsoft-chats-about-shiren-the-wanderer/": [
      "[How the DS version started]", 
      "- First, could you tell us how Shiren for DS came to be? Was there anything you had in mind specifically because the game is for the DS?", 
      "Nagahata – There were talks of having a Mystery Dungeon series for the DS, and the Superfamicon verions (SFC, the SNES version) came up when we were thinking of a theme.", 
      "Tomie – The Game Boy version was a candidate also, but that would have required us to redraw the pictures completely. That left us with the SFC and N64 versions, and eventually we decided on the SFC version.", 
      "Yamamoto – Back then (when developing the SFC version), there were very few colors that we could use in a game. The graphics had to be kept within 32 dots x 32 dots, and all the action had to be within those restrictions. However, the DS does not have such restrictions, so players will be able to see many changes. Of course, the technology has advanced a lot in the last 10 years.", 
      "Umetani – All the graphics for character movement were redone, and the effects were changed.", 
      "Yamamoto – When characters sleep, we added graphics so that they look like they are “sleeping.”", 
      "Umetani – The part that we intentionally carried over to the DS version is that the townspeople could be attacked by Shiren (laugh). At first, we thought of removing this, but after much discussion decided that keeping it was necessary.", 
      "- Has the game balance changed? Ex. Odds for meeting specific characters", 
      "Yamamoto – We re-did the program so people may feel that the odds are different, even if they are both programmed for a 1 out of 10 chance. Players of the SFC version may have different impressions. However, there are parts that are completely the same… Like having the “Deep Jar” placed in earliest parts of the game…which is not that helpful (laugh).", 
      "Ishigami – And the poisoned arrows (laugh).", 
      "Nagahata – Ahh, the radish and arrow, that’s really tough, too (laugh). Well, the game is basically the same, although the difficulty has been adjusted slightly. Some people may feel that the game is a bit easier.", 
      "- People say that the Shiren series is difficult even when compared to other Mystery Dungeon series.", 
      "Nagahata – The core of Mystery Dungeon is \"tension\" and \"reasoning.\" I think these concepts can vary depending upon how they are combined in a particular title or even on a particular console.", 
      "Yamamoto – In Shiren, you could only “clear the dungeon” or “get defeated”. There is no “exit dungeon spell” that returns you to town, like in Torneko. Also, Shiren could be perceived as “evilly” designed instead of just plain difficult (laugh). Like in SFC version, there are parts where you need to break through walls to move forward.", 
      "Tomie – The very basic premise for SFC Shiren was to make the players play repeatedly. Players will be able to move on with the scenario and will get a bit stronger (stronger equipment, items) every time they play, and progress as they play multiple times. So players of the SFC version may feel that the DS version is easier, due to their familiarity.", 
      "Yamamoto – For example, players of the SFC version may already know the special abilities of the monsters, so they may feel the DS game is easier.", 
      "- In other Mystery Dungeon games, we heard that there are certain restrictions within the title…", 
      "Nagahata – In Shiren, our team members [at Chunsoft] decide the characters and their specs, but other titles have their own set world that we cannot change. So we could say that Shiren is a title where we can fully express what Mystery Dungeon is capable of. In other titles, however, we can pick and choose the good parts of their world, and create a whole new Mystery Dungeon, and that’s definitely fun, too.", 
      "[About Characters and Gameplay]", 
      "It seems that the way Shiren’s party members follow Shiren is a little different…", 
      "Nagahata – In the SFC version, party members wander off unless until everyone reaches the exit room, but this time [in the DS version] they’ll follow as long as they are on the same floor.", 
      "Ishigami – This time, the company will keep following even if you fall into a hole. That doesn’t apply for Surala and Naoki [two non-combatant NPCs that you encounter during bonus scenarios], though… Well, Surala can recover her HP herself.", 
      "Tomie – I thought keeping Surala in your party would be tough, so I proposed it. By the way, Shiren’s company will appear in the ending if Shiren clears the dungeon with them. However that’s really hard, because they don’t level up and in most cases, they get defeated somewhere.", 
      "Yamamoto – In addition, monsters only went after Shiren in the SFC version, but in the DS version, characters like Oryu are also targeted. Pekeji at full-strength mode in the DS version is stronger than in the SFC version, though.", 
      "Nagahata – So then, Kechi might be the most difficult guy to keep alive?", 
      "Tanaka – We really wanted to change that one. They ask for players to give a valuable item, and they give back a Scroll of Need (laugh). In the DS version, they will give back something more useful.", 
      "Tomie – In the SFC version, Pekeji eventually stops appearing if you keep ignoring him… but that would not let players do the Bungee Jump event (laugh). So we changed that part.", 
      "- Are there any other things regarding events that players should know?", 
      "Tanaka – We struggled with the Bungee Jump event. The map generally allows moving sideways, which is different from other maps…", 
      "Yamamoto – We didn’t want to have vertical scrolling during that part…and we really had a tough time coming up with that. (laugh)", 
      "Tanaka – Besides the vertical scroll, the Bungee Jump is a flashy event so we took our time adjusting it. In one of the early versions, a different screen was linked when Pekeji fell… it was hilarious to see Pekeji fall into such a place (laugh).", 
      "Ishigami – In some of the dungeons, we couldn’t add monsters because there was no space to place them.", 
      "Yamamoto – Yeah…that part, the Bungee Jump and battling Kigny King were the parts we had a tough time on, because the programming style is different. In recent Mystery Dungeons there are 2 different programs: there is the one for the main story line with several events in between, and another separate one for the special dungeons. However the SFC version had to handle all of that using just the dungeon program. For example, in the part where the King of the Kigny is defeated and a bunch of townspeople come out, only two npc’s could be generated (laugh).", 
      "[About the Dungeons]", 
      "There are many dungeons after the ending stage (the Golden Condor)…", 
      "Tomie – We’ve always thought that carrying traps would be fun, but it ended up not being as fun as we thought (laugh).", 
      "Nagahata – Absolutely. We thought “that should make the game that much more fun,” but when we tried it, it just wasn’t as good as we imagined (laugh).", 
      "Tomie – Nagahata-san was obsessed with it after the N64 version (laugh).", 
      "- The DS version has additional dungeons, and each of them has a boss.", 
      "Umetani – So that’s why they appear every 10 floors. We did have an idea to have smaller Tainted Insects, though.", 
      "- Was Wi-Fi implementation difficult?", 
      "Ishigami – We first asked Nintendo if we could use our original servers. So the tough part was before the system actually went live. After it went live, it went smoother than we expected. This is probably because of our experience with Shiren for mobile phones.", 
      "- Are there limits to how many times a player can rescue/be rescued…", 
      "Umetani – Players can be rescued 3 times, but the number of times you can attempt a rescue differs depending on the dungeon. It’s determined by the difficulty of the dungeons; fewer attempts are allowed in dungeons where the rescuer is allowed to bring items with them, and more for dungeons where the rescuer cannot, like the Final Puzzle.", 
      "- The rescuers will lose all their belongings if they die during a rescue attempt.", 
      "Nagahata – Yes, they will be gone (laugh). We had that as a concern from the test players and the people who helped us in development. However we had to have the players lose items, because otherwise, players could abuse the Rescue feature to generate items.", 
      "Yamamoto – The rescuers will follow the exact footsteps of the player being rescued, so if the rescuer falls during a rescue, wouldn’t that mean the rescuer is less capable than the person being rescued?(laugh)", 
      "Nagahata – We have a reward system for the rescuers. Players can be rescued by many people via Wi-Fi, but the first one to successfully complete the rescue can also receive items from the person he/she rescued. We would really like to see a lot of communication through this system.", 
      "- Lastly, any message to the fans?", 
      "Yamamoto – There are many changes, so please explore the game.", 
      "Tanaka – Please jump the Bungee Jump. That’s all that I’d like to say. (laugh)", 
      "Tomie – Don’t give up… Something good will eventually happen if you keep at it.", 
      "Umetani – We would like you to check out the very different DS version, so please enjoy.", 
      "Ishigami – Everybody says that we made this game easier, but I don’t think so. Please check for yourself.", 
      "Nagahata – It may not look different at first, but once you get your hands on it, I think you will be able to see the difference. Players of the SFC version will surely like the DS version so please enjoy.", 
      "Chunsoft Staff", 
      "Hironori Ishigami",

      "Shiren is a port of a Super Nintendo (Famicom) title which was only ever released in Japan under the name Fushigi no Dungeon 2: Fūrai no Shiren. It was the second instalment in the Mystery Dungeon series and the first to feature characters which weren't borrowed from another franchise (the original Fushigi no Dungeon starred Torneko/Taloon from Dragon Quest IV). Both versions of the game, which are set in a fictional representation of feudal Japan, put players in control of Shiren, a ronin accompanied by his trusty companion Koppa (a talking weasel), as the two embark on a quest to find the legendary Land of the Golden Condor. It is this quest which will be your first and main goal when you begin playing, although you'll soon find that there is plenty of content to keep you occupied upon its completion. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's take a step back and look at the game's core gameplay mechanics.", 
      "As a roguelike, Shiren primarily takes place in a series of dungeons which become more and more challenging as you delve further into them. Each grid-based floor within a dungeon is randomly generated and features a selection of monsters to fight (there are more than 180 kinds in all), traps to circumvent and items to collect. Gameplay is turn-based, but generally far swifter than your usual menu-based RPG combat. Every time you perform an action (be it initiating an attack or using an item, etc.) you use a turn and everyone/thing else in the dungeon gets to do the same. This chess-like system, although simple, becomes key to the game's strategic depth as you become accustomed to exploiting it. As well as having access to a series of usable items (be they herbs, staves, jars, etc.) Shiren can equip a single weapon, shield, armband and a selection of arrows. Levelling up occurs after earning experience points from dispatching monsters, much like it does in any other RPG.  But it is here that any comparison to the likes of Final Fantasy must come to an abrupt end.", 
      "Still with us? Excellent. While the above statements are all true, there are some exceptions to the rules which prevent Shiren from being comparable to, say, classic arcade games in their complete lack of in-game persistence. A number of warehouses exist in certain towns which you can store items in for your next run through the game. Any items stored therein won't disappear upon death, allowing you to gradually stockpile a wealth of resources before you take on more challenging tasks. Furthermore, the first fifteen floors of the game (those leading up to Table Mountain, the first main dungeon) can be backtracked through in order to return to Canyon Hamlet. Doing so allows you retain any items or money you've collected during that particular 'adventure' (the name given to each excursion from the time you begin the journey until your inevitable demise/return to the first town). Although your level/stats will be culled as per usual, it is possible (and eventually essential in order to take on certain dungeons) to greatly power up weapons/shields, both of which support the usual '+number' modifiers, a la Dungeons and Dragons.", 
      "Beyond the aforementioned features, Shiren's various NPCs further develop the idea of in-game persistence by responding differently to your presence each time you come across them after being 'reborn'. Certain NPCs can even be recruited to join you on your travels, but not before you've seen them/helped them out on multiple playthroughs. Once you realise that the entire game has been developed in a way that assumes you will die over and over (and over) again, the prospect of progress-scrapping upon death becomes less of “an archaic gameplay concept that should have been scrapped with the introduction of memory cards”, and more of an integral part of a genre, which despite appearances, has little in common with many of the other RPGs currently on the market. In fact, the key to enjoying Shiren and being a successful Wanderer is to learn from your mistakes and constantly generate new strategies to overcome the game's various challenges. It's an idea that is entirely contrary to many role-playing games which reward you for simply levelling up until you're ready to progress (not that Shiren is entirely free of grinding, of course – some of the unlockable, DS-exclusive dungeons do require rather powerful equipment before you can even think about taking them on).", 
      "As you may have guessed by now, much of Shiren is focused on in-dungeon combat. The combat system is sublimely simple on a superficial level, but quickly becomes more complicated as you familiarise yourself with more and more monsters and items. Attacking is as simple as tapping A when standing next to a monster (or when in line with one if you're firing an arrow), but you won't be able to succeed if you rely on strength alone. You're going to need cunning, strategy and out-of-box thinking for each and every situation. Indeed, there is an in-depth selection of 50 'mini-games' in the game's first town which are designed to teach you just such thinking. Stuck in a room with tens of monsters coming in from every direction? Attack them all at once with a Blastwave Scroll. Need to slow an incoming foe which you know will pulverise you just as soon as it gets close? Use a Staff of Paralysis to paralyse it before making a hasty escape. Want to combine the explosion damage-reducing effects of the Blast Shield with your pumped up Armor Ward? Use a Meld-Jar and combine the two into one super-item. It sounds like gobbledegook now, but Shiren's strongest draw is the way it removes the focus from improving your character, and places it on improving yourself and the way you play the game.", 
      "Although Shiren is absolutely a single-player game, the DS version introduces a surprisingly enjoyable new Traveller Rescue feature which brings with it a strong community focus. Upon dying, players are offered a chance to send out a distress signal via the Nintendo WiFi Connection (or to any local DS systems). Said signals can either be picked up by anyone the player has traded friend codes with, or by a random wanderer. The rescuer must then proceed to work their way through the game until they reach the point at which the deceased snuffed it. The risks are great (rescuers can take their own items with them and risk losing them, or try their luck at going in naked), but the rewards can be fantastic. Successful completion of a rescue earns at least one item (some of which can only be acquired by completing rescues), plus the possibility of two more (one of which the rescued player is free to send as part of a thank you note for a mission well done).", 
      "Despite our first instinct that the feature would be all but ignored, we soon discovered that not only is undertaking a rescue great fun, but others seem to think so to! We've sent out a few requests over the past week, and all but one has been answered (and completed) by the time we next picked up our system. Further online support comes in the form of extensive high score boards which cover two months of high scores across all in-game dungeons (the 100 top scores are viewable for each) plus a selection of 'Legendary' high scores which record miraculous feats such as completing dungeons at level 1, or without any items. Combined with the game's inherent replayability as a result of its simple-but-deep gameplay mechanics and a ton of bonus dungeons to explore, these two WiFi features should help ensure that you'll be playing Shiren the Wanderer for weeks, if not months to come.", 
      "A simple and intuitive combat system is deepened as you progress and concoct new and more complex strategies for dealing with increasingly challenging situations. It's a roguelike, so it's not for everyone (in fact, its not for most people), but what it does, it does incredibly well.", 
      "It's a port of a Super Famicom game and it shows. Shiren could have been ported to the Game Boy Advance without losing much in the way of graphical flair, but that doesn't mean the cutesy 2D visuals don't look great.", 
      "Gentle melodic background music, atmospheric outdoor sound effects (pouring waterfalls, desolate windy deserts), frantic battle music for the more jam-packed floors; Shiren has it all, and it all sounds great.", 
      "We've already put in more than 30 hours with the game and have yet to even unlock all of the game's bonus dungeons, lets alone get anywhere near completing them. WiFi rescues and online leaderboards only sweeten the deal.",

      "(On Atlus USA) I guess it’ll depend on whether or not Shiren 3 sells well in NA, but Atlus needs at least ONE roguelike title per year. If they advertise Shiren Wii properly, there’s no reason they should skip Shiren 4.",

      "Shiren already has a warm place in some gamers hearts thanks to a fan translation many years ago, but I don't think this fanbase contributed to Sega's decision to localize Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer. What did?", 
      "KD: Chunsoft and Sega have always had a great relationship. However few of Chunsoft’s titles have made it over to the US. Shiren is a solid game and well-adapted to the DS, so it’s a perfect way to test the waters.", 
      "While Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer is based on the Super Famicom game Chunsoft revised the title. What's new in the Nintendo DS version?", 
      "For starters, there’s a huge improvement in the graphics. The DS doesn’t have the severe graphic limitations of the Super Famicom and they’ve taken advantage of it. There is now a fourth type of each monster (as the monsters themselves can level up) with different appearances and abilities. New dungeons have been added, each with their own themes and goals; for example, a dungeon where utilizing traps is the key. In addition we also have a new Nintendo Wi-Fi Rescue system that allows friends to resurrect your character if you fall in battle.", 
      "There are a few really cool items unique to the new dungeons. The Trap Armband will let you pick up and set traps, makes traps work on monsters instead of you, and gives you a snazzy red cloak. Bufu’s Cleaver can instantly carve any monster into Meat. If those make it sound like everything was made easy though, there are also new, gigantic Tainted Insects waiting to gobble you up.", 
      "My favorite new feature is how you can be saved via Nintendo Wi-Fi if you die in a dungeon. Can you elaborate on this? And why did Sega or Chunsoft feel it was a necessary feature?", 
      "The Rescue system is actually really versatile and can also be done using Wireless and with passwords. A defeated player sends a request to another player’s DS. The player who received the request actually fights his way through the dungeons up to the spot where the fallen player is. Then he sends a Revival Spell to the first player’s DS and he can also send one item from his warehouse to help the player out. The revived player can send a thank you note and also send an item. Even if you rescue someone and they don’t say thank you, Hoi the Missionary will give you a reward for your efforts.", 
      "The Rescue system is great because it adds a sense of a community to what otherwise is a single-player game. And of course it offsets the harshness of losing all the items you’re carrying when you die.", 
      "Only the North American and European versions will be compatible (as both are in English). The reason for this is more technical than language-related. Slight differences in the game program made it just too difficult to bridge the gap.", 
      "Is Sega making any tweaks or adding any new features for the US version?", 
      "Fundamentally, the games are designed to be identical though of course there are a few slight changes here and there to accommodate the change from Japanese to English. For a game like Shiren, you don’t really want to try to make the game different from the original. You might lose the flavor.", 
      "Speaking of tweaks the box art gives Shiren a different feel. Maybe it's just me, but I recall Shiren being a carefree character with his happy demeanor on the Super Famicom box and his optimistic smile on the DS box. He looks like a fierce warrior on the US box. Why the change?", 
      "Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer is rife with Japanese culture. Did this make the title difficult to localize?", 
      "There are always at least a few words or situations that are hard to transition to the English version, but the “Japanese-ness” didn’t prove too difficult however.", 
      "Will Sega ever consider localizing the original Super Famicom game and selling it on the Virtual Console? I recall the Japanese equivalent is already up there.", 
      "Currently we don’t have any plans to bring the Super Famicom version to Virtual Console, however we are bringing other classic franchises from that era to Virtual Console.", 
      "The Mystery Dungeon franchise has been very successful and popular with gamers over the years. We truly feel that this title is perfect for the handheld market as it’s a great pick up and play game. The Random Dungeons really lend themselves to a new experience every time, and due to the way the game is designed, players can play for a short period of time and still have a very enjoyable experience. Releasing Shiren on the right platform was definitely a key objective. Finally, we’re getting the word out through sites like yours, where we know your readers include the gamers who love this style of dungeon-crawler/Rogue gameplay.", 
      "What tips would you give to players who never played the original Shiren the Wanderer before?", 
      "Keep in mind that dying and losing items are all part of the game. New items are pretty easy to come by so getting upset about dying is kind of like getting upset about dying in Pac-Man; just roll with it and keep going.", 
      "There are a couple tricks that will help you out in the beginning: you can build up an inventory pretty easily by going through all of Fay’s Puzzles in Canyon Hamlet or even by picking an easy puzzle and going through it several times. For food, the tavern keeper in Canyon Hamlet will give you a Big Riceball every time you enter the town and talk to him. You could build up a supply by entering and leaving town several times and talking to him each time. Also, don’t forget to talk to people, especially if you feel stuck. They’ll either give you advice or help you out when you need it.", 
      "The last question is something I'm burning to know. Is Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer the start of a new Sega brand? Will Sega localize Shiren 3 for the Wii?", 
      "It would be great to bring over more of the Shiren games to the US. Of course, we can’t say we have any definite plans at this time but it will be interesting to see how well this first game is received and how loud the call is for more.", 
      "Nice job Spencer. This is the sort of content that you won’t find ANYWHERE else, and that’s why I keep coming back to Siliconera.", 
      "Yeeeeah! GameSpy also had an interview with Keith Dwyer but you, Spencer, asked MUCH better questions (as one who knows the wonders of the MD games)!", 
      "Great interview! I kind of forgot about this game until I read this, but I’m definitely going to get it now. I’m excited about the reviving aspect of the game, but hopefully it doesn’t take the other player too long to find your body.", 
      "i think the second game will be brought a few months before the third game arrive ^^", 
      "So buy this game people, and buy copies for your friends and family! I’ve been playing the Japanese port for over a year so I already know its a GREAT game (even if I didn’t understand any of the sotryline/dialogs), but I assume its going to have to sell pretty good for them to consider bringing Shiren 3 over on the Wii!", 
      "very awesome interview! to anyone from SEGA reading: THANKS!!! Moar Mystery Dungeon o kudasai.", 
      "While some of the guy’s answers are definitely marketdroid speak (like how he ducked questions about the fan translation), there is some heartening stuff here. I’ll probably have to write a column about this….", 
      "Thanks for the positive feedback, I’m glad you guys enjoyed the interview!", 
      "@Lord Gek – I wasn’t aware Gamespy even did a Shiren interview too. Thanks for the heads up. I’m glad Shiren is getting more coverage so it doesn’t slip past people’s attention.", 
      "Rumor has it Nintendo Power’s March ’08 issue (Tales of Symphonia cover) gave it a 6.5 (its too harsh with its death penalty). I have no reason to doubt this but haven’t seen this for myself yet.", 
      "Sorry, this terrible box art does not convey a “new edge” for me.", 
      "Lord Gek: Sounds to me like a classic case of a clueless reviewer. He’s probably never even heard of Nethack.", 
      "@John: I wonder, I plan on reading the review myself today. This is exactly what happened to Torneko: The Last Hope back in 2000. It was torn limb from limb in the reviews with the reviewers finding the game too harsh and simplistic (which, yes, if you didn’t get that this was a roguelike and not a standard RPG they may have had a point)."

      "It is a tower though, and there are definitely guns involved. Most of them are automated, mechanised and pointing at whichever body part you consider to be your tenderest. If only there were some method of fighting back at your disposal. Oh wait, there is! Using other, different guns.", 
      "First-Person Shooter plus Roguelike.", 
      "You get a different tale every time you restart, though repeats will begin to creep in around your tenth attempt. It’s a loose framework around which to hang the reason for your escapades, but like a good short story each one sketches just enough detail to serve its purpose.", 
      "Like those games of yesteryear, there are secrets to be found in obscure locations. I’m talking “this part of the wall looks identical to the others, oh wait it’s transparent and there’s stuff behind” obscure. Most of the time you only carry one weapon (chosen at the start,) but it’s possible to find outlandish secondaries in hidden levels or locations.", 
      "The Roguelike aspect isn’t just restricted to repeating, randomised levels and regular death. It’s also present in the perk system and the kind of pick-ups you can grab on each attempt to scale the tower. At the start of the game you can only opt for a triple-jump ability or the negation of fall damage, but as you progress and achieve various feats of heroism (or fragility) more perks become available. Things like increased speed for an armour trade-off, or the “Too Young To Die” easy mode (unlocked after a damage threshold has been reached) which gives you a huge advantage against basically everything.", 
      "New guns unlock in much the same way. You start off with a pair of slightly rubbish ones, and end up with access to rat-a-tat laser rifles and a hand cannon that can compete with your foes in the comedy oversized shell stakes. Blowing up enemies makes them scatter delicious collectable items all over the floor, including blue shards that can power your weapon up to more impressive levels. Taking damage will reduce that power level, so there’s an incentive to stop and destroy things rather than just attempting to duck and weave masterfully through every location. Especially since each level ends with an imposing boss encounter.", 
      "Problem is, the guns feel a bit wimpy. I’m not someone who has any interest in weapon authenticity, and intense talk about the FEEL and IMPACT of guns in games honestly gets a bit disturbing. But even I can tell that the plop-plop of bullets against enemies who flash for a bit and then vanish with a canned explosion is a bit dissatisfying. While dancing around enemy bullets is intense, besting them with your own firepower doesn’t feel as triumphant as it should.",

      "\"Tower of Guns is among the top games in the rogue-elite genre, which is starting to become so popular on game consoles. When you also add old school shooter gameplay, stylish visuals, huge amounts of content and upgrades into the mix, Tower of Guns will make an excellent console title,\" said Jakub Mikyska, CEO of GRIP Digital."

      "How many bullets can we fit onto a single computer screen? We're sure that's what Joe Mirabello, the man behind Terrible Posture Games and the creator of Tower of Guns, must have asked himself before embarking on the project. We picture a breakfast table, where he sits contemplating the great mysteries of life over a cup of coffee. Why are we here, what is the meaning of life and how difficult can a videogame be while still remaining fun to play?", 
      "Tower of Guns is an exercise in patience, fortitude and old school twitch reflexes. It's an arcade game with an endless supply of enemies and a single goal, get to the top of the tower. The game experience is highly concentrated and according to the developer it shouldn't take more than an hour or two to complete it, if you've got what it takes. Tower of Guns is difficult. Not hard like playing the latest AAA game on the hardest difficulty setting, we're talking old old school tough. Mega Man and Quake difficult. So let this be your warning, Tower of Guns is not for everyone.", 
      "If you expect a certain amount of progress in a game you will be sorely disappointed. Most likely your first five or six runs in Tower of Guns will take place in the first two levels, the easy ones. You'll die a lot and upgrades and new weapons will be few and far between. Even when you manage to unlock something new the game doesn't become any easier, so to progress you just have to grit your teeth and man up.", 
      "Luckily the game is generated anew each time you restart, so you never know which enemies, which rooms or which bosses you'll encounter on each level of the tower. The game rewards fast reflexes and the ability to master old tactics like circle-strafing and bunny jumping. Even so it doesn't take much to kill you and an element of dumb luck is essential to get as high up in the tower as possible.", 
      "Almost everything in the game is made by Joe Mirabello himself and Tower of Guns is very much the quintessential indie game. It looks incredible with a visual style that lands somewhere between Borderlands and Ratchet & Clank. The music sets the tone well and keeps the pace up. The level design is relatively straightforward with ample room to move around and use the environment to dodge bullets. The tower is divided into rooms and each one supplies a new challenge, with only a moment between each one to catch your breath. The doors are opened by shooting them, just like in real life!", 
      "There's little context for what takes place in Tower of Guns, but every time you start a new play-through you're treated to a new twist on what passes for story in the game. Each time some form of narrator asks you to shoot everything in sight and get to the top of the tower. It's hard to explain but it definitely makes the game a lot more fun to play.", 
      "Aside from being both fun and challenging, Tower of Guns can also be terribly frustrating. We don't mind games that are repetitive or that force the player to play it several times to unlock new features. What bothers us the most is the lack of forward momentum in the game. You are never told how far up in the tower you got, or how far you had left until the top. When you die there's a statistic of how well you did with information such as your kill count. The thing that is presented in the boldest and most visible font, however, is how many times you've died in Tower of Guns and that doesn't really motivate me to play another ten times to unlock a new perk or gun.", 
      "We respect developers who leave large studios to do their own thing, who defy economic difficulties to publish the game of their dreams, the one they want to play but no one else in the game industry wants to make.

      "Levels are randomly generated, but each world stays within a certain design flavor, like a giant warehouse, industrial factories, and a glorious-looking, lava filled “forge” level. Sadly, these are all-too familiar worlds to shooters, but this is a game that’s informed by its history and then places its own radioactive spin on it. Twitch shooters at their best are a combination of environment plus reaction, and when you remove the comfort of knowing how a level or enemies are laid out, an extra layer of tension returns like an old friend. I mean, it’s not as extensive as it could be; play the game long enough and you’ll start seeing room patterns repeat, especially in the initial “Foyer” level.", 
      "I would like to think all guns should be valid strategies when combined with the right perks and badges, but I never found a good reason to use those initial offerings again. I stuck with a trio of guns: a hefty hand cannon which one shots most regular enemies, an area of effect rifle somewhat between a pistol and rocket launcher, and a shotgun. Your weapons can level up when collecting little blue dots or shards, causing them to become more powerful, fire faster, leading to a positive reinforcement loop as the difficulty automatically escalates.", 
      "After about 5 hours of playtime, including 2 glorious victories, I had seen everything the game had to throw at me. Which was fine, actually. That wasn’t a problem. I like what I see. It’s tough and challenging but fair. The various iterations of the levels always threw something new at me in terms of configuration or enemy type. I got exactly what I expected, and a little bit more. I kept going back for the unknown nature of what I was facing, how many of them, and enjoying the sweaty-palm circle strafing, multi-jumping, and epic destruction you can rain down when you’re blessed with the right combo of random items."

      "It’s tough to say. There are still relatively few of us making Roguelite+FPS combinations right now (and each of them are different enough) so many of us are able to stay pretty friendly. If there are barely enough games in your sub-genre to be collected together and sold as a tidy “themed bundle”, then it’s probably a better use of your time to be collaborative rather than competitive. If no one has heard of ANY of your games..or even your entire subgenre..any single game’s success simply helps out every one else in the scene. That may change later—particularly if any one of us does so well that money-grubbing companies start churning out crappy clones.", 
      "Honestly, it’s largely Binding of Isaac’s and Youtube’s fault. Isaac was very smart in how it combined a handful of classic RL mechanics with Zelda’s dungeons. It was also a lot of fun to make youtube videos of since everyone’s videos would be different. Isaac made me (and many, many others) ask, “what other genres might be fun with some RL mechanics sprinkled in?” It took us all a year or two to make our games but now you can find almost every kind of mashup imaginable. While most of the resulting cocktails have very little left in common with a true roguelike (which is why the “roguelite” term emerged) that doesn’t make them any less compelling.", 
      "Additionally, the roguelike and roguelite genres both are well-suited to indies because they take a much smaller pool of art and design assets. They rely on randomization over curation and are well suited to design and balance experiments—which makes for hilarious results. The random nature and short play sessions allow for more player forgiveness and the subgenre’s very tropes themselves allow for flexible design: it’s easy to expand or contract your game’s scope by simply adding more random elements, which call for minimal reworking of the underlying balance or design philosophy. It’s a super flexible subgenre.", 
      "For the gamer, all of this leads to a different sort of conversation between the developer and the player than gamers are used to. In the last few decades we’ve seen big budget games walk an ever narrowing path of absolute curation, of fixed, tutorialized, directed, cinematic, experiences. Roguelikes take control away from both the player AND the developer—a concept that would be slammed at every studio I’ve worked at for being “badly designed”. Now I recognize that concept had merely been “out of fashion”. I think Isaac brought it back in style.", 
      "Well, I tried to keep Tower of Guns honest. My goal was to make a silly diversion for fans of classic FPS games. I wanted something they could enjoy a full experience of over their lunch break, without obligation for any further play, and I let that be my litmus test for everything I added to the game. To be frank–that’s exactly the kind of game I myself had time for, and so I deliberately setting out making a game “for myself”, if that makes sense. Along the way I made a lot of mistakes, and some of those mistakes ended up being a lot of fun. Being a solo developer meant I was able to be very flexible about steering toward, rather than away from, those sorts of serendipitous accidents. For example, many of the more bullet-hell-esque aspects of Tower of Guns, where you’re double-dutch dancing between 200 bullets all at once, came out of initial mistakes.", 
      "I’ve actually faced very little direct adversity. There were the normal “haters-gonna-hate” type people who were offended that I dared utter the words “Quake 3″ and “roguelite” in the same sentence, but for the most part reception has been warm. It helps that I don’t have an delusions about what Tower of Guns was though and I wasn’t trying to over sell it. I am still learning as a developer, and while it was a lot of fun to make the game, and while most people seem to think it was worth their money, it’s also not without fault.", 
      "As for competitors, although there are a handful of other FPS roguelites out there, the biggest direct competitor out right now to Tower of Guns is Paranautical Activity, since it’s going for a similar twitch-based, fast-paced feel. Even then, the two games feel and look vastly different though. And the devs of PA and I have been careful not to come across as adversarial toward each other over twitter or anything, which is an attitude I think extends to the fans.", 
      "What do you think the future holds for rogue-likes and indie fps games?", 
      "I think the future of the indie FPS looks really bright. There’s been a democratization of tools, some simplifications of the pipeline, and a growing recognition by many seasoned developers that they don’t have to keep working as a simple cog anymore if they don’t want to. As a result I think we’ll see better and more interesting explorations into the FPS genre, which have historically had a higher technical barrier-to-entry.", 
      "Hah! It’s been both! I oscillated like crazy between being incredibly excited and incredibly discouraged. I went through periods of extreme demotivation and of awesome inspiration. It was absolutely harrowing, but I learned a ton too—and I came out the other end a much better developer than I went into it, so I would absolutely do it again.", 
      "If you’ve got a next project in mind, what are you going to do differently?", 
      "I think I want to make something smaller in scope. Tower of Guns wasn’t exactly mammoth in scope, but it was large enough—and random enough—that I had to make a lot of artistic compromises. The game looks about as good as it could for one developer’s work …and I knew that if I listened to my inner artist too much then the game would never be completed. So, after twenty months of telling that inner artist to shut up, I’d like to let myself have a bit more fun artistically on my next project, whatever that might be.", 
      "Don’t pick up the Difficuty++ Badges. Also, thanks for being awesome. :-)", 
      "Any future plans for Tower of Guns?", 
      "I’m actually working on a patch for the game right now, which should be complete in the next week or two. While the patch adds minimal content it does add a lot of bug fixes, steam achievements, more controller support, performance fixes, and a few surprises.",

      "Edit: ALL THE CODES ARE GONE! YOU GUYS READ FAST!", 
      "In case you missed yesterday’s video, Tower of Guns is a neat little “Rouglite” FPS, which brings the feel of Quake or Doom to the permadeath, randomized dungeon-crawling genre made popular again by The Binding of Isaac. We did a spotlight on the game for the first ever episode of Super Indie Bros, but I also did an email interview with Joe Mirabello of Terrible Posture Games, which is really just the name he uses when he makes games like Tower of Guns all by himself. We ended up talking about indie games as a whole, and what the rougelite fad tells us about it as a case study. The whole thing’s presented to you below, completely unedited. Enjoy!",

      "Introduction:", 
      "Gameplay:", 
      "Roguelikes are traditionally turn-based 2D strategy games, there’s been a few more recent advances into the action RPG genre. For example, Rogue Legacy and Binding of Isaac. Both very good titles, both 2D. Terrible Posture Games have taken a chance on procedurally generated 3D maps for an FPS and they have worked out a treat. Although some rooms will be similar in layout and design, it’s still impressive that they are able to link together with ease. They aren’t completely procedural, I’ve had a few rooms appear twice but the enemies are always randomized. Roguelikes have been around for a while, but they seem to have become more popular in the last few years, as such, it’s nice that it has the feel of an old school FPS. Developed on the Unreal Engine which obviously helps, but the texture work and the colour palette are what brings back the nostalgia graphically. Speaking of graphics the options for the game are solid. An FOV slider on a game developed by one person is superb and the graphics options on a whole are pretty in depth.", 
      "For each run you are given a choice of guns that can be unlocked by completing various feats within the game. For example, destroying 250 cannons over the course of several runs will unlock a new weapon. Dying horribly a couple of times will also unlock a new gun. It’s a trait of the genre. Although each run cannot be replayed, you still contribute to the progression system through the game, unlocking more powerful weapons and traits as you become better at the game. The trait system is also a nice addition to your loadout. Selections vary from triple jumping to reduced difficulty to immunity from environment effects and each has their own benefits during the game. Having reduced difficulty will help you ease into the game slowly but being able to triple jump might let you get up to that ledge that’s just out of reach. Somewhat frustrating considering that ledge is highly unlikely to be there when you come back on your next game!", 
      "The gunplay is where the real nostalgia kicks in. This game is fast, really fast. To the point where if I stopped to pop a quick screenshot I was risking death. Every. Single. Time. Jumping from platform to platform whilst annihilating your enemies and collecting health in the form of pick-ups has a certain Unreal or Quake feeling. A blast back to my early teens and when I should have been working harder at Uni. Every part of this game adds to that feeling of nostalgic comfort. From the loot drops, to the sound effects, to the music and right down to the unlimited ammo! If you even slightly enjoyed old school FPS, you know, before Modern Warfare ruined the genre then get this! Apart from being scared of being blown back to the Stone Age at every corner, you can level your weapon as you kill enemies. Blue energy will push your level up, giving you more power to your punch, but taking damage can drop the weapon level. Do you risk killing all the enemies in the zone or try to run past? It’s a lovely little risk/reward function that isn’t often present in Roguelikes and adds an additional thought to your play style for each and every run.", 
      "Final Thoughts:", 
      "Tower of Guns wasn’t a game I enjoyed to begin with, but after a few runs and becoming a bit more familiar I started to become immersed in the title. It’s a game that I’ve kept coming back to over the last week or so and will probably continue to play over the next few weeks! It’s incredibly difficult but rewarding title and will have you yearning for simpler times when Team Deathmatch with Insta-Gib was enough for a full night’s entertainment!",

Unlike many dungeon crawlers, UW is extremely open-ended, allowing the player to play a number of non-combat roles such as hunter, hermit, fisherman, or trader.

      "However, there were plenty of comments to the contrary, claiming that SoD (Save or Die) is the only way to go in order to make encounters and individual monsters threatening.  I can only assume that this style of play which would crave SoD powers and spells are the same group of gamers that want every encounter to be life or death, and who enjoy a good TPK once in a while.",

      "Clerics have never seemed to have gotten the “lovin” they deserved under older D&D rules, and as much as I’ve enjoyed playing Clerics in the past, I really felt they finally got it together in 4E.  Clerics are healing powerhouses now, and what’s more, they can deal decent damage while still throwing around temporary hit points… and buffs… and heals!", 
      "Sadly, the Vancian Magic system which Monte wants to force into D&D Next will take us back to a cleric that must choose to be either a heal-bot or a sub-par fighter with a little healing option here or there.   The difference between a paladin and a cleric in older editions came down to only a few minor differences, and from a play feel, there was little difference between them.  Certainly, the 3.5 Domains and Domain powers, as well as additional weapon choices from deity selection really helped to make the cleric play style more unique, but the limited spell slots per day still limited the actions of the class to either healing or fighting.", 
      "I like that Bruce brought up the Priest class in his blog, which came from the Second Edition Skills and Powers books.  While still limited to the Vancian Magic spell slots, it would be interesting to see how that class might be developed in the new edition as a different option to the mace-and-platemail heal-a-bot that the old cleric used to be.", 
      "Frankly, I cannot for the life of me recall a single example of the “iconic cleric” from fantasy literature – and I’m not talking about any novel that references a D&D setting, thank you.  Healers in almost every fantasy novel I’ve ever picked up have reminded me more of a wizard than a cleric, and quite often, the healers in those novels ARE wizards or sorcerers.  That sort of healing comes from years of training, or alchemy, or herbology, or magic – or a combination of any or all of these.", 
      "So while the Iconic Cleric is a part of “Classic D&D”, maybe it’s time to be retired in favor of a new type of healer that is more like a subclass of Wizard than a pseudo-fighter with cure spells?  I know it’s radical, but there are probably more fantasy fiction fans and RP gamers out there that can identify with Elrond, Polgara, and Master Herbal than a healer-in-a-tincan.", 
      "First Speed-Dating… now Speed D&D?", 
      "Hey, I know that all our lives are busy, and we want mobile devices to get us news, movies, and social media at the touch of a button.  But exactly when did we, as a D&D gaming community, decide we wanted to play D&D in only an hour?!  Today’s Legend & Lore article strikes me as both baffling, and shows a complete detachment for what D&D gamers really want from their game.", 
      "Oh sure, I know there has been some concern about the length of combats in D&D 4E, and there are length of blogs out there with great advice about how to make them shorter using minions and other tricks.  And frankly, it’s not just a problem with 4E, because I recall plenty of encounters under OGL/3.5 could last an entire night.  But I don’t think that I, or any of my gaming buddies, have ever said, “Hey, we got an hour, let’s roll up characters and run a complete D&D adventure!”", 
      "D&D is not a board game, it’s a role-playing game.  It has never been about how much you get done in a session, but rather it’s about the characters, the story, the mystery, and the danger of being an adventurer.  It’s about how the heroes solve their problems, work their way to the end of a mystery, and triumph in the end – whether it is by cunning and wits or by swords and sorcery.", 
      "While simplified character creation and rules are well and good, they should not be a priority just to get things done fast.  When I go visit my friends for my campaigns on a weekly basis, I’m looking to spend an evening entertaining them with my adventure, spinning a tale of combat and intrigue that will transport them away for a time from the mundane world to a world where they are powerful wizards and heroic warriors and cunning rogues.  If we only have an hour to play, we pull out a beer & pretzel game, but we sure don’t want to play D&D.  Trying to pack an adventure in an hour would cheapen the experience, not enhance it.", 
      "As to what you can get done in a heroic campaign, and in a short time, well D&D 4E works just fine for me.  In my last session this weekend, I ran two encounters, role-played, and ran a skill challenge, all in three-and-a-half hours.  And that included the time my gamers and I all sat down to dinner together, caught up on current events, and took a break for dessert.  Sounds like a full evening to me, and it got them two-thirds of the way through a sidetrek adventure they stumbled upon as they were fleeing from the country as enemies of the state!", 
      "I daresay that the only folks that want to play an adventure in an hour are the promoters of D&D Encounters.  But let’s try and remember what Encounters is supposed to be – a way to get gamers into the brick-and-mortar stores, and to get them educated and interested in D&D 4E.  Adding an expectation of one-hour D&D adventuring into D&D Next, and making that concept part of the design paradigm goes wildly against what “classic” D&D has always been: a role-playing game where it takes as long as it takes to get through an adventure and a campaign!", 
      "Conclusions", 
      "So again, why are we, the gaming community and a group of Wizards of the Coast designers, going through this exercise of trying to create the “perfect” D&D gaming system, when the no two groups of gamers can ever reach consensus on what D&D is all about?  Isn’t this project more likely to create a game system that no one will like, either lacking in or presenting  features, which one gaming group or another will consider to be “Not D&D” to them?!", 
      "Even in my own 4E D&D game, I have a couple players that love my game, show up at every session, but still claim that D&D 4E isn’t “really” Dungeons & Dragons.  While they don’t really care much for the 4E system, they still show up for the camaraderie of gaming with good friends, and to enjoy the role-playing in my campaign – which I take as compliment to my DMing skills.  They don’t consider what we are doing “real” D&D, however, and to them my game is more like a time in years past when I ran a fantasy role-playing game using the HeroSystem.   Sure, the setting was pure D&D (i.e. Greyhawk), but the system wasn’t the real deal, even if it was a fun diversion for a while.", 
      "Personally, I can’t see anything but trouble ahead for D&D Next.  I cannot imagine who this new version of D&D will be marketed to, and I’d love to see what data WotC used to decide that there was a market out there for a Frankenstein’s Monster of a game system, slapped together from the odd body parts of every previous edition of Dungeons & Dragons.  I’m sure that there is someone who might see past this mess to love the monster despite its appearance, but really isn’t it more likely that there will be a mob of D&D gamers, armed with metaphorical pitchforks and torches, once again pounding on the castle walls of WotC for creating another abomination that’s “Not D&D”?", 
      "So until next blog… I wish you Happy Gaming!", 
      "You think #dndnext is the worst thing so far? Did you miss 3e and 4e?", 
      "Sorry but stepping away from 4e is a good thing for the D&D game because to almost anyone I spoke to it’s not even D&D. It’s a decent “new” game but it’s not D&D.", 
      "My hope is they do step back to the previous versions and I hope past 3e because it’s only slightly better than 4e and I never liked it either.", 
      "Im also not sure what the hell Mike, Monte and WotC are up to. If they are aiming to unite all D&D fans under one banner- this is not the route to go! My gut instinct is that they need to hit a high sale rate or they will end up in serious trouble with Hasbro. I’d like to see them either do one of two things- have D&D Next be a continuation of 4th edition or to scrap 4th and advance the 3.5 ruleset into a direction away from 4th.", 
      "I’m just really annoyed with D&D Next. Resources from 4th are being siphoned to the development of a new edition 3 years after the release of 4th! (Mike Mearls said they started looking into a new edition in late 2011). BS is what I say! I wish Meals was gone from WotC- he’s destroying D&D!", 
      "What you’ve said here echos my thoughts on this entire process. I predicted a new edition of D&D when Mearls started up the Legends and Lore column, and I was saddened to be right this January. If that “leak” that’s wandering around out there is in anyway real (and I’ve heard it called a fake, but only WotC is saying that for certain, and at this point, I doubt they’d be honest), then this system is going to fail, hideously. And if it’s fake, somebody went to a lot of trouble to make so much of it match what WotC has announced at the D&DXP seminars.", 
      "But it seems Mearls is going to create what he wants, and once this mess is published, it will fail, and Hasbro will shelve D&D for 5 years. I’d rather that doesn’t happen, but I think the writing is on the wall.", 
      "Like Hunterian7, I think that if 4e wasn’t working for them, they should have gone back to 3.5 (even though I came to hate it in the end), and tacked on Cook’s “Book of Experimental Might.” They’d have a better product if they had. But Mearls wants to create a retro clone that doesn’t give the retro fans what they want (or need), or the Pathfinder fans anything they’ll be interested in (or need), and he’ll have lost the 4e fans, too. He’ll reunite the community in their hatred of him.", 
      "I guess we can sit back and watch the train wreck…", 
      "I agree with some of your points, but I disagree with your characterization of today’s L&L article.  They aren’t saying that the core D&D experience will be one-hour adventures.  What they did say was that D&D needs to run such that a complete adventure (or, more realistically, a complete story – with beginning, middle, and end and a mix of encounter types along the way) can, if so desired, be completed in an hour.  Think of it more like a TV episode.  I, for one, strongly dislike the feel of Encounters (I, like you I’m guessing, favor of longer, more intricate story arcs) but could easily imagine a situation (such as introducing new players to the game) where the goal is to arrive at a complete story rather than a super intricate and involved one.  I want that tool in my toolbox as well as those that allow me to build super long adventures with lots of plot threads, a number of encounters, etc.", 
      "The meat of today’s L&L article from a design standpoint, in my reading, was that the focus will go from encounters (little “e”) as the core unit of design to adventures as the core unit of design.  I.e., you’d have an XP budget for a complete adventure, and could distribute it among as many fights (or, of course, other sorts of challenges) as you see fit.  There’s of course a number of potential pitfalls – i.e., loading all that xp into a single very VERY difficult combat) and that’s where good adventure editing and good DM judgment would be required.  But, as a DM who prefers storytelling, I think there’s some good potential there for giving me the flexibility to build the story that my players and I want to build.", 
      "So, maybe there’s the possibility that optimists like myself are not completely off base.  But of course, because I have not seen the actual rules, I could be totally wrong and they could be complete insane and, worse, un-fun.  But, after seeing the past work of the people who are designing this game and how generally good to awesome it is, I’m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt until they give me a concrete reason not to.", 
      "Honestly, compared to a lot of things, I didn’t have too many problems with what the articles were suggesting.", 
      "Save or Die?  Yeah, they’re gone for good, and players won’t ever be happy to let them back in.  It’s simple enough for a DM to remove the “safety” from these sorts of magic, to make it more like it was in the TSR days… but it has to happen at a table where a monster or a spell that “can kill you with a stare” is considered fun.  These tables do exist, but perhaps with less frequency than they should.", 
      "Kill the Cleric?  They’re entertaining the idea.  I was a long-time fan of the idea that there should only be 2 classes: mages and fighters.  I don’t think they will be able to remove options from players… and whichever way they end up going, a supplement will come along to soon include the other.  The days of endless 300-page supplements are not over.", 
      "One Hour D&D?  Here I disagree with you wholeheartedly.  Only playing for D&D for a short time, or at a fast pace simply for time sake, isn’t always desired… but as a long time 3e DM I found that the intense amount of preparation and tactical play was simply boring.  Guiding new players through character creation in 3e or Pathfinder takes hours.  If a character dies, a new one often can’t be quickly inserted.  Complexity is good if you want it, but quicker creation and quicker resolution means DMs can prepare more, characters can get in the game quickly, and more of the game’s world can be explored… and I can’t twist these notions into a drawback.", 
      "Regarding the one hour adventure business, here is what I have: Pre-3e (A)D&D + about fifteen combatants + low-level = a ten-minute combat. In my 4e experience, a fight like that would take at least an hour, probably two. That’s who the game’s “quick mode” will be marketed towards: gamers who want to get through a good number of fights in a short session…", 
      "Well yeah remember all of those things 4th got wrong? I don’t know about you guys, but I sure loved having to have (be) a heal-bot or a character with a scroll/wand case full of a dinky healing item to tap the big fighter character to their feet. And I still don’t see why they even tried to get rid of my vancian magic system, I mean it was fair because I was stronger than everyone for like, an encounter! We didn’t have to take a rest after every encounter if our GM had written a better adventure. And oh man, remember templates! I love being a half vampire, dragon drow! Most original character ever!", 
      "The Vancian system, Save or Die effects, the Five-Minute workday, crazy multiclassing a required healer, the game breaking past level 12 and templates being used by players were probably my biggest beefs with 3.5finder. After running 4th since launch, my problems with the system are mostly the skill list, rituals, required items (fixed by alternative advancement) and feat bloat. I am not saying Next can’t be a fun game, but it is beginning to resemble 3.5finder too much and I am loosing interest.", 
      "Anyway, my two cents.", 
      "As to the question of who D&D Next is targeted at,my guess would be all the Pathfinder players. What little information regarding sales that reaches the general public indicates that Pathfinder folks are buying more stuff than 4E D&D folks. Hasbro wants those sales and seems to have decided that the problem is not writing 4E books that gamers want and need but to redesign D&D to capture the Pathfinder people (while making them want to buy all new books I presume). Oh, and keep the faithful that stayed with D&D past 3.5 if possible as an afterthought.", 
      "All those little multiple choice questionaires are what worries me. If they are to be used as the marketing research to build around then what happens if the winning choice of item A does not mechanically work with the winning choice of item B ?", 
      "What we are witnessing is the classic case of designing to fit what one guesses the public wants rather than making a good product and then convincing the public to try it. Works for headphones and tea kettles I suppose, not so sure about pen and paper role play games.", 
      "Oh yeah, almost forgot. The ‘iconic cleric’ in armor with a mace bit. If I recall an interview I read with Gary Gygax way back in the day he said that the medevil church of the crusades and stories like the Song of Roland were the main inspiration for D&D clerics. Mr. Gygax had a catholic upbringing. Quite a number of biblical references can be found in the D&D and AD&D work that he was involed with.", 
      "@Bob – Well until you’ve tried 4E, I don’t think it’s fair for you to judge it so harshly… try it at least once before you agree with the random nay-sayers.  As to your dislike of 3.x/OGL, I understand that everyone “likes what they like”, but the financial success of 3.0, 3.5, Pathfinder, and other games that use d20 as their engine, tends to suggest there are plenty of role-players out there that would disagree with your assessment… myself included.", 
      "@Hunterian7 – I don’t know as I’d say that Mearls is out to destroy D&D, but I do question what market research they scrapped up to allow them to disavow 4E so early, and to try and recreate old edition D&D as the Next best thing in gaming.  A buddy of mine suggested that perhaps we’re seeing the market research happening right now, and that the “playtesters” are actually “focus groups” to determine what they should be designing.  Based upon the questionaires attached to every blog they post, it might not be such a far stretch there.", 
      "@Doc Ryder – Yes, I don’t feel that 4E was given a fair shake, and all indications are that it’s being mothballed way before it’s time.  I’m with you in predicting that there will be 4E fans galore angry over what’s due to come out, if the blogs are any indication, and I’ll be right at the forefront, leading the angry mob!", 
      "@Aoi & @Par – Hate to disagree, but encounter design, adventure design, and the speed of advancement is one of the myriad things that 4E got right!  Knowing your XP budget, and that you will have 8-10 encounters per level makes it SO much easier to plan an entire adventure of a given level, whether you want to have 2, 3, 4, or all 8-10 encounters in any given adventure.  Any expectation of a single adventure taking an hour is ludicrous, because heroes tend to do what they want, unless you plan to make adventures linear affairs and lead your players by the nose.  And like I said in my blog, roleplaying is about the big picture and the continuing storyline, not about what you can cram into a single play session.", 
      "@Aaron – I know… I just can’t wait to roll up my Next fighter that gets to swing once per round for the first 5 levels while the wizard blows stuff up with his spells.  Man, I really miss those rounds of waiting to make my single attack roll with my weapon, cause that’s all I do is hit things, and then miss, so I can go off and watch TV on the couch until something actually HAPPENS!  Who needs complexity for a fighter like 4E thinks is cool when I can just spend my time between attack rolls watching Lost Girl on SyFy… woot!", 
      "Dnd next is out now, its called labyrinth lord", 
      "[...] I think is what Michael over at Neuroglyph completely missed when he posted his article about a few D&D Next Legends and Lore topics(You’ll have to scroll down to find the section on the One Hour D&D article). With all due [...]", 
      "If this is legit, than it is worth a read for a laugh. But again take it with a grain of salt.", 
      "Neuroglyph, I read a lot of frustration in your words. There is a lot here that could probably be said a different way and actually end up ahead for being more constructive. Much of what you write is really fantastic, but the valleys are so dark and low! More peaks, more peaks!", 
      "Do I hear things about D&D Next that worry me? Of course. I can’t imagine there are too many people that don’t get that feeling. That’s a playtest for you, however. The first versions of adventures organized play sends out for playtest are often severely flawed. If people judged the work I do by the playtests, I would never be allowed to produce any D&D work. Nor would many of our top bloggers, authors, designers, and developers. There is a reason expertise is useful in this industry – it is hard work and takes iterations to get right.  We as customers do the game a disservice if we let our frustration blind us to the potential.", 
      "When we react to things we don’t like with anger and frustration, that’s what we further: we get more anger and frustration. While storming Wizards with pitchforks sounds cool (and would produce fabulous loot) it isn’t going to make for a good D&D Next. The conversation needs to be constructive.", 
      "I have tons of great games. I have 4E. I have 7 or so editions of D&D and many more of other games. And yet, I’m willing to bet I’ll love D&D Next. And the one after that too. The best way to make all these games great is to share what we love, to bring energy to the process, and to be passionate while being constructive and respectful.", 
      "Yikes, if that link to the SA leaked 5E info is real and not a fake, I am somewhat terrified about what 5E will end up being like. Not terribly surprised, but like facing a beholder and an ancient red dragon armed with a +1 dagger worries….."

You can exchange gold for HP and MP upgrades, and you can unlock special NPCs who sell upgraded items and perform new services for your heir.

      "What makes Dark Cloud unique is the ability to upgrade your weapon from a simple wrench to a fearsome weapon. The difference between the first game is that if your weapon broke it was gone forever, this however is not the case in the sequel. This was gladly accepted as people thought that this was too harsh of a punishment, now the player only loses experience. The player collects ABS points to level up their weapon improving their attack power and synthesis points. These are then used to merge with synth spheres to gain extra abilities. Weapon abilities include Attack, Flame, Lightning, Smash, Beast, Durable, Chill, Exorcism, Cyclone, and Scale. When all abilities have been met, the player can build up his weapon, making a better looking and stronger weapon.", 
      "As the story unfolds, Max and Monica gain more powerful weapons and abilities to aid them on their quest. New gameplay features that are introduced into the franchise are the ability to change or transform into a secondary character that can be used in dungeons. Max, as an inventor, brings his robot called Ridepod, a slow but formidable fire and defensive power. Ridepod can be upgraded by customizing different body parts from shops or inventing your own. Monica has the ability to transform into monsters, obtaining their special attack and the use of communicating with the same breed.Also townsfolk can be brought with you to help you in dungeons, though not controlled directly they offer items and abilities that are useful and should be taken advantage of.", 
      "Though this game is primarlily focused on fighting this is not the only part of the core gameplay. The purpose of searching these dungeons is to gain Geostones. These Geostones are plans that are used to make houses, trees, fences, pots, benches and more. The player collects material to construct these obtained plans, which is called the Georama system. You can place your creation anywhere on the field, but the story will not develop if certain conditons aren't met. The purpose of re-building a town is to restore the future to what it once was.", 
      "Also new to the series is the introduction to the game of Spheda. Similar to golf, the player uses a Spheda Rod to hit shards of space-time known as spheres back into the Time Distortion. Time Distortions and Spheres are either colored red or blue. The same colors repel each other, so a blue colored sphere will not go into a blue distortion. To change the color of the sphere, the player can hit it against the ground or walls to change the color.",

The Ridepod is fully customizable, able to change the weapons, the way the Ridepod actually gets around (I.E. you can change the legs out for track) you will need to invent these upgrades yourself, or buy them from Cedric. The Ridepod is used against certain bosses, along with some heavier trash that appear in dungeons.",

Even more than that, they’re unlikely to take the series back beyond Nintendo systems for the foreseeable future. A Level-5 developed DQ XI would be amazing though.", 
      "Yeah. That was just a bit of wishful thinking on my part. Level-5 is always going to stick DQ to the biggest install base, so a 3DS DQ is most likely. The online aspect however might give them pause, since DQX didn’t really become this big thing they were expecting.", 
      "Not Level-5, but Square Enix. If Level-5 were left to decide, I’m sure they wouldn’t have minded doing DQ IX on PS3 or PSP after they’d done VIII pn PS2, but that was Squenix’s call. Now they’ve got Armor Project doing X on Wii/Wii U. If Level-5 is brought back for another DQ they’ll have to abide by whatever platform decision Squenix makes.",

Much as I’d like another traditional RPG in that IP, it would lend itself really well to being expanded into an MMO.",

      "That combat system just screams MMO. Timed attacks which piggy-back off each other for increased damage. Early bosses and maps also look almost identical to things shown for True Fantasy.",

      "So yeah… My opinion here is stated purely from what I’ve played with no regard whatsoever to the company that built it or it’s history and with zero idea of what I was getting myself into. And that opinion makes me surprised that Rogue Galaxy is relatively well spoken about…", 
      "Okay, the start was promising, very promising. I really dug it at first, it certainly gave a slight Star Ocean feel to the whole thing and had a slight western deal that was reminiscent of Wild Arms to me, just a slight bit, the active battle system directly in the map we traversed was entertaining and whatnot…", 
      "But then some minute little troubles came creeping up, which forced dull repetition into combat that flowed relatively well but didn’t evolve much past what was first presented save for three gimmicks, one being to jump on enemies to stun them, another to jump attack them to make them vulnerable or deal damage pending the enemy and the last being the more annoying one, being that Jaster was the only character with a shield breaking gun that dealt extremely low damage. And there isn’t a lot of guns that can break shields… Actually I think there’s only one gun that breaks shields because I don’t remember ever seeing another one.", 
      "The flow began to stutter and interrupt itself. I was alright with it being a pretty cookie cutter story because, hey, to me it’s sorta like a throwback. Simple, fun, classic boy becomes hero may or may not be born from a legendary person, very run of the mill but nice presentation…", 
      "But the gameplay just stuttered and eventually grinded down to a halt. Every battle felt the same, if they didn’t feel the same it felt like the game was just forcing me to play with a relatively useless gimmick outside of those gimmick battles and even then it didn’t flow very well, jumping wasn’t exactly the best of things to control in fights and changing guns was a hassle. While you could just stick with the shield breaking gun you kill about a quarter to a third of your combat option which really stiffles the gameplay and the presence of these shield enemies discourages experimentation with your party composition and then there’s the fact that you get a full field damaging skill pretty early with every character which makes every fight a breeze to the point where the game might have benefited from having a much smaller encounter rate with more substantial battles instead so to better capitalize on the fighting system and not overplay it until it was a dead horse beaten down by just how long it had to walk down the same repetitive straightforward path.", 
      "And then there was me finding out I could get an end-game sword within the start of the game… With relative ease… And I did… Prior to actually looking up a faq to discover that yes, I had accidentally created an end-game sword that could fare all the way to the end… Making the weapon crafting system somewhat superfluous but still, hey, it’s there it’s not bad… But even that became slow because that’s a whole other bit of grinding that just felt superfluous and tacked on…", 
      "Rogue Galaxy was one of the very few PS2 games without load times in-game (thanks to SCE, I imagine.) Being a very long game on-top of it and being easy to find and cheap (SCE again) made it popular amongst those that got it.", 
      "A lot of people had tolerated Xenosaga, so something along the same lines in terms of repetition and availability minus the down-time was appreciated.",

      "I’m a masochist gamer, which means I enjoy inflicting unnecessary amounts of pain and tedium upon myself purely for the cathartic relief of overcoming a challenge. Give me Dark Souls for a day and I probably won’t even manage to beat the Taurus Demon, but I’ll surely spend the entire day trying! Call me insane, but it’s this mentality that drives Risk of Rain, a roguelike Sci-Fi Platformer that’s so magnificently brutal that should you get past the third level, it’s an achievement! If you don’t however, you can just try again. And again. And again.", 
      "When you begin, you can choose from a variety of classes, such as the commando, robot janitor, or acid spitting experiment. Each class is equipped with four unique abilities in a MOBA-esque fashion which allows you to approach the game in a different way; perhaps adopting a hit-and-run style as the experiment, or simply shouting “DEMOCRACY!” when you punch enemies as the robot janitor. You can also unlock more items through challenges and achievements, which provide even more variety on your “160th” play-through. With so much variation, it can get frustrating (and perhaps intimidating on your first playthrough) when the description of an item you pick up is as vague as, “Hooah,” but usually figuring out what an item does is fairly trivial.", 
      "Where Risk of Rain sets itself apart from other roguelike games is with it’s difficulty mechanic. While you can choose from one of three difficulty settings at the start of the game, the difficulty increases over time from very easy, to medium, progressing to very hard, continuing into impossible, and finally ending at “HAHAHAHA”. This makes for a very interesting balance between farming for items and progressing through to the next stage, especially when you consider how hectic combat can get at times. While a strong tactic in FTL would be to stall just before the fleet reached the exit point, you may want to be more efficient in finding that pesky teleporter in Risk of Rain. Then again, you might prefer to stall on your “30th” play-through, raking in items and experience, to beef up your character before moving on. If it’s not clear by now, this is not a one-time playthrough game.", 
      "However, being a team of only two guys who were too busy making a game or drawing assets, the music was provided by Chris Christodoulou, and it’s freaking amazing. The soundtrack beautifully complements the dark, foreboding atmosphere of the game. One minute you’ll be serenaded through your search for the teleporter with tranquil 8-bit melodies, the next you’ll be tapping your feet to upbeat retro-themed metal as you shoot through hordes of minions. You can get it on Bandcamp, and you should. Because it’s that awesome.", 
      "After my 12th hour and “90th” playthrough of Risk of Rain, I’m still reaching back for more. I’ve made it to the final stage again and again, but sometimes I barely make it a couple of minutes. It’s a game designed to be played hundreds of times over without ever feeling repetitive; even after my 15th hour and “150th” play-through! It looks and plays astonishingly well, and if you’re willing to look past the complete lack of any coherent narrative, it really is a masochist’s perfect game. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must go back and play again. (and then likely again!)"

Sounds rather simple, save for the fact that by activating the teleporter an enemy boss will appear and try to stop you from getting away.", 
      "As hinted above and in the title of the game, the longer you play, the more likely that harder monsters will appear to take you down.

How you play the game is your decision: do you rush through it with an underpowered character, or take your time to explore and unlock as many items as you can?",

      "The game starts easy enough, pitting slow, infrequent enemies against the player as they search for the teleporter, but in five minute increments the difficulty increases from ‘Easy’ to the dastardly ‘HaHaHaHa’. Even the death screens are discouraging, mocking the player with messages such as “ur dead LOL get wrecked.” There’s not much hope for the players, but the compulsion to prove the game wrong and succeed can be a driving force. As the difficulty peaks, enemies which are normally bosses will begin to spawn normally, and players will be forced to use every resource available to survive. It’s a system that accustoms both rushers and completionists who want to scour each level before finishing, and it helps maintain freedom in play. However, it can also be unforgiving at times, especially to players who are still learning mechanics. Fortunately, there are item dispensers available that help players keep up with the pace.", 
      "100 items are highlighted by a different colour classification that indicates their rarity. Most have a stacking effect that persists during their respective playthrough, but the player can also hold one more-powerful item which requires a recharge period between uses. One particularly cool item allowed me to create “ghost” duplicates of every enemy on the screen to assist me in my fight, and another made every shot I made do explosive damage. Multiples of the same item will cause effects to add, and furthermore there is no limitation in the amount of persistent items at a time— the bottom of the screen can literally become filled with power-ups over the course of the game. Items are randomized on each level, but because of their immense usefulness later on, it sometimes felt that survival relied on me lucking out and getting the good ones early. There is some skill to using the items, but as the game progresses to the state of chaotic, there’s not a lot of time for strategy.",

In many early games, this was an incredibly handy technique to get around the technical limitations of the hardware and create the illusion of huge worlds that would otherwise be impossible to realize.", 
      "It’s not without downsides: Procedurally generated worlds can be bland and repetitive as familiar elements are recycled and rearranged over and over again. At the same time, when it’s used well, it can easily immerse players, transforming them into swashbuckling adventurers roaming among the stars or crawling through the depths of a dungeon in search of treasure within a massively replayable world.",

      "Developed in 1980 on Unix systems by Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman, Rogue was the granddaddy of the roguelike genre, featuring the basic staples that define it: randomly generated dungeons and loot every time a player starts the game. It even had a goal — to get to the deepest part of the dungeon to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor.", 
      "There was no going back to earlier levels, either. This was a one-way trip to the bottom. Dungeon-crawlers never knew what the game would create for them next, which made it a unique challenge that would be repeated by many others on all sides of the world.", 
      "Initially stuffed inside 128K of RAM and built by a five-man team (eerily mirroring No Man’s Sky’s humble start), Starflight’s vast universe populated with 800 planets used procedural techniques to craft each one right down to its ecosystems and resources. A number of other concepts were also used to generate random alien names for members of seven different races, all adding to the illusion of an interconnected galaxy filled with hidden wonders and making Starflight a truly iconic sci-fi title.", 
      "Bethesda’s epic sequel to The Elder Scrolls: Arena used procedural techniques to create a landmass roughly twice the size of Great Britain that was populated with towns, cities, and wilderness features. The dungeons were also generated in the same way from prerendered pieces and all jumbled together to create cave-like tunnels and bricked rooms linked by twisting passages.", 
      "Coupled with randomly generated side quests, players could technically adventure endlessly for loot and levels. It was also amazingly buggy on release, which dampened some of the excitement. But even so, its sheer size makes both Oblivion and Skyrim combined look like medieval suburbs.", 
      "For many fans, Persona 3 is one of the best entries in the long-running Shin Megami Tensei series, which features an incredible cast of characters and a number of unique role-playing game elements. Although the main quest was fixed, the layout of each level of the massive dungeon were all randomly generated from set pieces, ensuring that no two visits would be exactly the same. This also added a challenging degree of uncertainty to the usual dungeon crawl, similar to that which roguelikes had long enjoyed.", 
      "Using the same concept behind games like Elite and Daggerfall, Gearbox Software generated millions of combinations for the guns and other pieces of equipment flying free from the dead hands of bad guys in Borderlands. Gearbox’s system mixes and matches parts and pieces across a huge spectrum of statistics, creating the illusion of a near-infinite arsenal. Judging by the success of the series as a whole and the endless threads of posted screenshots showing off everyone’s favorite legendaries, it worked really well.", 
      "The relatively recent 2012 reboot of X-COM used procedural techniques on a slightly smaller but no less important scale compared to other games on this list. Most mission types, their environmental layouts, and the enemies lurking in each would be just as random as the planets in Starflight or Elite, which kept the main campaign fresh outside of a few key points related to the story.",

      "NetHack is a single-player roguelike video game originally released in 1987. It is a descendant of an earlier game called Hack (1985), which is a descendant of Rogue (1980), this is one of the most similar games to the original Rogue.", 
      "It’s a wonderful game, you go around through a dungeon looking for the Amulet of Yendor! Beware, it is no easy task, because death is permanent, and you -will- die a lot. But do not be discouraged, it is still quite the experience, with all the different routes you can take. Started more then 20 years ago, it is still in active development, and packed full of interesting features, such as the ability to tame wild animals and teach them how to shoplift, or learning the ways of wizardry, or even just quaffing random potions and seeing what happens. You can start hallucinating, levitate, turn into stone, have your potions of fruit juice boil and explode, read gravestones, and use wands to shoot magickal bullets, and forget to pay attention to your dog and have it turn feral and eat you.", 
      "So as you have seen the game offers a lot of different options, characters and ways to play it, also for the graphic you can choose between classic ASCII or a graphic with tiles.", 
      "Another good thing of Nethack is that it’s usually available as package in many different distributions so it will not so hard to start playing it.", 
      "Angband is a free, single-player dungeon exploration game where you take the role of an adventurer, exploring a deep dungeon, fighting monsters, and acquiring the best weaponry you can, in preparation for a final battle with Morgoth, the Lord of Darkness.", 
      "The game revolves around exploring a 100-level dungeon, in which the player seeks to amass enough power and equipment to ultimately defeat Morgoth. A new level is randomly generated each time the player changes levels, which gives Angband great replay value: no two games are the same.", 
      "The game It is based on the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, in which Angband is the fortress of Morgoth.", 
      "Getting started with the game is easy. You can play with graphics or in original ASCII text (it’s more fun than it sounds), and there is extensive in-game help. Pressing ‘Enter’ also brings up a list of commands you can choose from whilst you’re getting started.", 
      "Tales of Maj’Eyal (ToME)", 
      "Tales of Maj’Eyal (ToME) is an open-source, single-player, tactical role-playing roguelike and action game set in the world of Eyal.", 
      "This is the Age of Ascendancy, after over ten thousand years of strife, pain and chaos the known world is at last at relative peace. The Spellblaze last effects are now tamed, the land slowly heals itself and the civilisations rebuild themselves after the Age of Pyre.", 
      "It has been one hundred and twenty two years since the Allied Kingdoms have been established under the rule of Toknor and his wife Mirvenia. Together they ruled the kingdoms with fairness and brought prosperity to both halflings and humans. The King died of old age fourteen years ago, and his son, Tolak, is now king.", 
      "The elven kingdoms are quiet. The Shaloren elves in their home of Elvala are trying to make the world forget about their role in the Spellblaze and are living happy lives under the leadership of Aranion Gayaeil. The Thaloren elves keep to their ancient tradition of living in the woods, ruled as always by Nessilla Tantaelen the wise.", 
      "The dwarves of the Iron Throne have started a careful trade relationship with the Allied Kingdoms for nearly one hundred years, yet not much is known about them, not even their leader.", 
      "While the people of Maj’Eyal know that the mages helped put an end to the terrors of the Spellblaze, they also did not forget that it was magic that started those events. As such mages are still shunned from society, if not downright hunted down. Still, this is a golden age, civilizations are healing the wounds of thousands of years of conflict, even the humans and the halflings have made lasting peace.", 
      "You are an adventurer, looking for old powers, treasure and glory. You boldly go in lost and forgotten places, untamed forests and sealed ruins. What will you find in this age of supposed peace ?", 
      "The game it’s still tagged as Beta (number 31 at the moment) but you can start to play it, if unsure check this video:", 
      "DoomRL (Doom, the Roguelike) is a fast and furious coffee-break Roguelike game, that is heavily inspired by the popular FPS game Doom by ID Software.", 
      "DoomRL is turn-based, offers a top-down interface formed entirely of ASCII characters, and features a character leveling system with traits. As it is based upon Doom, the game is more fast-paced and combat-oriented than usual for a roguelike, and relies heavily on ranged rather than melee combat. A limited player inventory, non-stackable items, and other design choices contrast with the often extreme intricacy of games in its genre.", 
      "DoomRL includes the entire Doom soundset (although a significant subset of the sounds are not presently used) and music library, with optional support for high-quality MP3s.", 
      "ooo DoomRL will try soon thanks!",

      "One example of the new navel combat features is the Puckle gun, where you can have an automatic machine gun on your ship- you free aim with the right stick and can use it to destroy weak points on the enemy ships. You’ve also got burning oil that you can leave behind you in a line. It sets the enemy ships on fire, giving you more strategic options in combat. And it’s just a lot more fun.", 
      "I’m also very proud of the new ship that we have, it’s called The Morrigan- it’s a sloop-of-war and it’s got those new weapons that we talked about earlier. And it’s so much fun to sail. So the naval combat and the North Atlantic world are two things that I’m most proud of.",

      "Advanced Education Minister Andrew Wilkinson earned himself a headline last week for telling B.C. universities to quit wasting scarce public funds and their students’ scarcer tuition money hiring lobbyists...", 
      "According to court filings, General, also known as Hajistahénhway and Chief Rock, has witnessed and notarized — without legal Canadian authority — everything from people’s financial disputes, to legal matters, to declarations appointing peace officers.", 
      "The SNPBC obtained a court order in November 2013, demanding General cease and desist, but the society alleges he has since breached the terms of that injunction by continuing to hold himself out as a notary, and is in contempt of civil court.", 
      "As a Native of the Cayuga First Nation, General says he is exempt from Canadian laws. If a judge rules he is in contempt of civil court, he could face a fine and possible imprisonment.", 
      "General said he witnessed documents for British Columbians, including adherents of the anti-government Freeman-on-the-Land movement, who found they were unable to get their documents notarized by licensed B.C. notaries.", 
      "“That created what I’m doing, because people were getting turned away (by notaries), a lot of people who were just doing paperwork, affidavits, to claim their freedom and claim different rights. People who want to be sovereign or people who were labelled Freemen,” General said. “They said they prefer working with Native people than they would working with the Notaries Society, because they’ve been refused so many times.”", 
      "General plans to represent himself in Friday’s hearing, where he will point to treaties in place for centuries between government and First Nations.", 
      "Lisa Monchalin, a Kwantlen Polytechnic University professor of criminology who plans to attend court Friday, believes General has a valid point about jurisdiction, saying: “International law applies here, not Canadian law, and Canadian courts do not have jurisdiction here.”", 
      "The SNPBC alleges General is an Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Argument (OPCA) litigant, a legal term for a category of vexatious litigants, including the Freeman movement.", 
      "The term was defined in a landmark 2012 ruling in Alberta that provided an extensive overview of the Freemen, Sovereign Citizens and similar groups, trying to help “eradicate the growing abuse that these litigants direct towards the justice and legal system.” In that decision, Associate Chief Justice John Rooke wrote that OPCA litigants may or may not claim affiliation with those groups, and noted these litigants: “will only honour state, regulatory, contract, family, fiduciary, equitable and criminal obligations if they feel like it. And typically, they don’t.”", 
      "While General said he has helped Freemen and agrees with some of their ideas, he disputes the description of himself as a Freeman or an OPCA litigant.", 
      "But David Georgetti, the lawyer retained by the SNPBC for Friday’s contempt hearing, said: “The documents Sino was purporting to quote-unquote ‘notarize’ are consistent with those commonly associated with the Freeman movement.”", 
      "Affidavits connected with the case include documents stamped and signed by Hajistahénhway, bearing several hallmarks of Freeman documents: thumbprints, arcane Latin phrases and demands for large amounts of money.", 
      "One of the documents purportedly notarized by General appears to be a court order made “before Adjudicator Hajistahénhway” and signed by Hajistahénhway, ordering the defendant, the Haisla Nation Council, to pay the plaintiff “$100,000,000 in fine one ounce silver bullion 99.9 per cent and/or the equivalent in the lawful currency of the day.”", 
      "Roger D. McConchie, lawyer for the Haisla Nation, said he received a series of documents seemingly notarized, stamped and signed by Hajistahénhway.", 
      "“I got some incoherent, bizarre gibberish delivered to my office several times,” McConchie said. “It’s obviously, to someone who knows the legal system anyway, less authentic than Monopoly money.”", 
      "A commercial lawyer in Vancouver who reviewed some of the case material said the documents purportedly notarized by General had “an equal amount” of legal authority as a napkin. However, he added, “it’s definitely less useful than a napkin. At least you can do something with a napkin.”", 
      "General said he took on notary work in order to help people, not for money.", 
      "Ron Usher, general counsel for the SNPBC, said they have no way of knowing whether or not General earned a profit from notarizing documents. But, he said, similar self-styled “gurus” sometimes do earn a handsome profit, usually from charging for seminars and services for those looking to get out of debt or legal woes.", 
      "In the days after a seminar, Usher said, the province’s notaries are inundated with people demanding to have bizarre documents signed, and “often, it appears to be fairly desperate people who spent their last $400 on a weekend seminar to learn how to avoid all their debts if they just get this magic document signed.”", 
      "OPCA litigants and “gurus” remain a persistent nuisance for the courts, said Michael Kleisinger, unauthorized practice counsel for the Law Society of B.C.", 
      "The Law Society is aware of General, but has received no complaints of him acting as a lawyer, Kleisinger said. But the society often has to deal with self-styled “gurus” and their followers, “when they represent people or try to sell their magic beans.”", 
      "“The guru comes and says, ‘I can get you out of paying your mortgage or you don’t have to pay your taxes’ ... And the guru provides them with legal services or advice, and then we go after the guru, too.”", 
      "The arguments of these OPCA “gurus,” Kleisinger said, “never work. Never. They leave a trail of rubble behind them every time.”",

      "An elderly couple who were tricked into letting a rogue builder pave their driveway were mystified when a series of dodgy tradesmen kept calling at their home.", 
      "The visits took place over five years but the homeowners could not work out why they were being singled out.", 
      "But now police have the answer – the original builder had left a ‘code’ pattern in the driveway to tip off other cowboy traders that the owners were an easy target.", 
      "The builder, who massively overcharged them, at £4,000, left the job unfinished in August 2009 but at the centre of the driveway he had placed a squared pattern of different coloured blocks.", 
      "The residents had not asked for the pattern but thought nothing of it – until other tradesman began calling at their home in Plymstock, Devon, all offering to carry out work which did not need doing.", 
      "The house calls included four builders offering to re-do the work the original trader had left unfinished.", 
      "And in November a man told the victims that they were entitled to £14,000 compensation for the poor work but claimed he would need £6,000 in order to release the cash.", 
      "The couple asked the man to call back – and went straight to the police.", 
      "Officers are now warning other homeowners to check their driveways for unwanted patterns. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said yesterday: ‘There are grounds to suspect it is there to identify the house as a potential target for these type of offences.", 
      "‘Each time the victim has had visitors offering work the men attending have changed. He does not have any details for the men, but states they have been a mixture of English, Romanian and Irish males.’", 
      "One of the homeowners, aged 70, said yesterday: ‘We paid for the work to be done, but they never sanded or sealed the driveway. A second lot came along, then another group, then another. I believe the paving symbol, which I didn’t ask for, is a signal for other people to look out for.", 
      "‘My concern is they could be targeting other elderly people. There could be some gullible old woman living by herself thinking she has to pay up. I think these people will continue to try their luck with others.’", 
      "There have been several instances before of conmen and criminals using a secret code to identify potential victims to each other. The most notorious is the so-called ‘Da Pinchi Code’, where burglars use chalk symbols to let other criminals know whether a property is worth targeting.", 
      "The marks are made in the pavement by would-be thieves to indicate who lives in a house and whether there is anything worth stealing.", 
      "One sign in Manchester, in the shape of an open book, says a vulnerable female resident is the occupant. Another symbol of interlocking squares indicates a homeowner who is ‘nervous and afraid’.", 
      "Since the distinctive pattern was laid, a series of rogue traders have called round the house offering unwanted services", 
      "A cowboy builder left a coded pattern in the driveway of an elderly couple to let other rogue traders know they were an easy target", 
      "Police suspect the symbol could be a sign dodgy builders leave to identify a 'potential target'", 
      "Since the pattern was left on the unfinished driveway in 2009, at least four tradesmen have called round to fix it.", 
      "One offered to sand the driveway down, something the original builder said he would do.", 
      "A second trader said he would seal the drive - also something the first workman promised.", 
      "Next a man offered to do the guttering on the property, before the most recent builder said the couple were due £14,000 compensation for the original builder's shoddy work - but he would need £6,000 upfront first.",

      "Some background information about Sword of Fargoal, this is not Final Fantasy 12 or anything of the sort, SoF is oldschool to the point that many of you that watch the MC #40 will probably be turned off by it (which would be a bad thing).  What is so great about a game that literally has no animation for the characters on the screen?  Barely any sound effects and very sparse graphics that make you wonder why they aren’t better probably won’t change your mind.  If, that is a big if, you give SoF a chance though, let it take you by the imagination you will be rewarded many times over.  SoF is an RPG of sorts, you have creatures to fight, gold and other loot to pick up and this really powerful sword at the bottom of this dungeon you are attempting to delve into deeper and deeper (SoF is similar to Rogue and other games).", 
      "The graphics being bare leaves quite a bit to the imagination of the gamer which will help players get sucked in even more.  Along the top of the screen of the original SoF game is your player information, hit points, experience points and amount of gold acquired.  This area also acts as the status bar, when you fight a creature, it’s type will be shown here, when you find loot, it is listed here too.  When you start a level, you are presented with very little other than a screen that is all shaded in and this small area around your character that you can see.  Moving around the dungeon will reveal more of the level, just be careful, there are monsters in that darkness (and lots of loot and the rest of the game).", 
      "This episode of Matt Chat features gameplay footage of the Commodore Vic-20, Commodore 64, PC remake and even the iPhone release (don’t get your hopes up, the graphics are understandably kept simple, though dated).", 
      "The other great thing about this episode is that Jeff McCord did an interview with Matt and reveals some very interesting tidbits about SoF, his early programming career and how he survived in Palo Alto early on.", 
      "If you want to find out more about the wonderful game of Sword of Fargoal then definitely check out Matt Chat #40, opportunities to hear from the creator of a game like this don’t come around often.  To Jeff McCord, you rock."

Around your 12th birthday, you learn of a mysterious pendant that your godfather is holding for your 18th birthday, along with some vague but special information about your heritage and destiny. Near your eighteenth birthday you return to the farm to find it burned, your godparents dead and the amulet of your birthright missing. Your best lead is a set of gigantic footprints leading north toward the caves in the nearby mountains, so you stop at the nearby hamlet on your way to the caves.", 
      "At this point, you set off exploring the caves north of the hamlet, which serves as a proving grounds. The caves don't offer much story until you reach the bottom floor (Mine Level 4), where you find a scrap of parchment. As you read the parchment, it contains a missive ordering someone's assassination and mentions a fortress north of the nearby town of . This leaves you with an uneasy feeling, and since you've reached the bottom of the mines and killed most of the remaining bandits, you decide to return to the hamlet. As you approach, you smell burning thatch and it begins to dawn on you the meaning of the missive: someone is out to kill you for your special heritage. Finding the hamlet torched, you realize that someone has been out to kill you this entire time and that those who you now seek to avenge were killed because someone was after you. With new resolve, you continue towards Bjarnarhaven.", 
      "After traveling west along the road for about a day, you arrive. Bjarnarhaven is a larger town than your starting hamlet, and includes the branch office of a bank alongside better stocked shops. Shortly after reaching Bjarnarhaven, you travel north to the bandit fortress. Besides tougher bandits, this fortress does not have much more to speak of than the caves did, until you battle your way to the final floor of the dungeon where you encounter Hrungnir and a band of hill giants unlike the other bandits you encounter. Armed with your lust for vengeance, and all of the experience and equipment that you gained as you conquered the eleven floors of the dungeon you manage to slay the hill giant lord and his entourage, and recover your birthright.", 
      "As you slip the amulet around your neck and begin to activate its magical power, you see a vision of a man who calls himself your grandfather. You learn that the amulet you now hold is actually the Amulet of Kings, signifying your royal blood. Your grandfather tells you that the Castle of the Winds, where he once ruled, now sits in ruin. He tells you that a terrible evil force laid siege to the castle and that it now falls to you to step in and reclaim your castle in order to restore peace to Midgard. As the vision begins to fade, he tells you to activate the magical power of the amulet once more, and you will be brought to the land of your ancestry to retake what is yours. This is where the first episode of the game ends, and you are encouraged to order the full game to find out how the story ends.", 
      "After activating the amulet again, the amulet’s magic pulls you across Midgard to a small town. You find yourself in a small town (small, but larger than Bjarnarhaven). As the dizziness of the amulet’s spell wears off, you examine the town discerning the shapes of the usual structures, as well as the keep of the local Jarl. You then gaze into the distance and see the massive ruins of your birthright, the Castle of the Winds.", 
      "Your first strategy is to visit the local Jarl and see if he will offer you any aid as the heir-apparent of the Castle. At least, that was the idea. When you approach the gate and announce yourself to the guard, he laughs in your face, “Ha! Another one!”. Because of the pretenders before you and the difficult battles of the town, there is only one way to prove yourself to the townsfolk: by steeping your sword in blood.", 
      "The town you are in is called Crossroads, located directly under the former majesty of the Castle of the Winds. On the day of the castle’s fall, none of the townsfolk know what happened; everyone in and around the castle died on that day. What they do know is that it was an evil day for Crossroads, earthquakes and unnatural lightning shook the castle and sounds like a demonic invasion echoes down the hills.", 
      "People suspected that King Lifthransir had been involved in dangerous matters, but none expected his castle and throne would be destroyed in just over a day. Worse yet for the townsfolk, evil creatures and bands of raiders have been coming out of the castle since that day. But they have steeled themselves, and created weapons and magical items that far surpass the fare that you encountered in Bjarnarhaven and the bandit’s fortress.", 
      "You steel yourself and make your way to the castle. As you pass through the archway, a chill runs down your spine, but you press forward to the ruined throne room and encounter the undead shade of your grandfather from the vision. He hails you as his champion and tells you the tale of the castle’s fall centered around a powerful magical artifact, the Helm of Storms. Loki made a deal with Lifthransir, granting him the Helm of Storms.", 
      "As with all of Loki’s plans, there was a catch. In fact, there was more than one catch. It turned out that not only was the helm stolen from Thor, but also that the demonic fire giant Surtur had his eye on the helm as a tool to rival Thor and rule Midgard. Before Lifthransir had begun to master the helm, Surtur struck and ruined the castle. At his death, Lifthransir cursed Surtur, swearing that one of his own bloodline would come and reclaim the castle. He then became the shade you saw, haunting the castle until the day you reclaim the throne.", 
      "He then opens the dungeon to you. You descend, quickly clearing the first floors down into the dungeon with little more difficulty than the bandit fortress. The floors begin to get more difficult, but a few more floors down you see a peasant chained to an altar. Quickly killing the nearby ogres, you set him free. He identifies himself as one of the townspeople from Crossroads, captured in a raid and enslaved. You happened on him just before he was to be offered as a sacrifice to the demonic Surtur. Thanking you, he sets off on his own to return to Crossroads.", 
      "On your next visit to Crossroads, you stop again at the Jarl’s keep, and this time he hails you as a hero. He rewards you with gold and some advice for the dungeon.", 
      "You return and continue down the 25 floors, seeing strange and evil sights as you continue. You encounter natural beasts and twisted beastmen savagely working together. You also encounter elemental portals, where strange elementals pour into Midgard. Deep within the dungeon, you eventually encounter epic giant-kings, first the hill giant king who sent Hrungnir for you. Then the stone giant king, followed by the ice giant king and the fire giant king.", 
      "Finally, at the final floor of the dungeon, you meet Surtur. Killing his fire giant minions, you boldly approach him and strike him. At first, he recoils in shock, unable to comprehend why a mortal would even consider striking a god. As recognition of you begins to dawn on him he roars in furious anger.", 
      "Your epic battle with Surtur ensues, you using every enchanted tool and magical spell you have learned while he fights you with crushing titanic strength and the awesome Helm of Storms, which he is gaining increasing mastery of. After a grueling battle, you swing a mortal blow but he vanishes suddenly. Taking some time to recover, you seek him out again and engage him again. He manages to escape again, but you persist, repeating this battle for hours until finally, you manage to strike him down finally forcing him from Midgard battered and bloody.", 
      "On the scorched ground where you vanquished him, you find the Helm of Storms. You carry it back up the 25 dungeon levels (as its magic conflicts with the magic normally used to return to town instantly) and present it to your grandfather. Lauding your success, he informs you that not only did he hear the sound of your victorious battle, but that Thor granted you the Helm of Storms as a reward. Lifthransir then steps aside and invites you to take his throne, crowning you as the new king of the Castle of the Winds!", 
      "After creating a character, you are given control of your character (almost always in a town). The game is tile-based, so your character's motions and interactions are effectively limited to a grid. Most of your character's actions can be controlled either by using the keyboard (sometimes to access the windows menus) or by using the keyboard. Movement is often as simple as hitting a keyboard arrow or clicking the mouse, and interactions (including combat) often involve trying to move onto or over the object in question. Other times, interaction is performed by moving on top of something and then activating a verb command. Combat is a combination of attacking an enemy by moving in their direction, or spellcasting.", 
      "Almost immediately after creating a character, you can interact with the shop keepers. The inventory screen mostly involves dragging items into their appropriate slots (again, this *can* be accomplished using the keyboard). Shopkeeper interaction is only slightly different, dialogs will appear with the asking price or selling price. There are a few interesting quirks about interacting with shopkeepers, from selling unidentified items, to trying to sell worthless items or items that a shopkeeper refuses to take (but these have little impact on overall gameplay).", 
      "Other gameplay elements include dungeon exploration and story interaction. The game provides a wide array of utilities for exploring the dungeon, which can help with filling out the map, identifying the location of items and monsters or moving around the dungeon. This allows for a wide difference in play styles. When first playing through the game, a player might try to fully explore every dungeon level and try to hit every story sequence, while in another play session a player might ignore exploration in favor of a speed run or a quick loot grab.",

      "Describing FTL in terms of other games is pretty tough. I mean, yes, its randomly generated galaxies wouldn't be out of place in a rogue-like and it does at times feel like an unholy mix of Elite with Command and Conquer, but FTL is something different altogether. Guess it could essentially be described as a tactical combat explore-'em-up with a hint of RPG and an odd feeling of authenticity, that is played from a top-down perspective in which you get to do what every space explorer loves doing. You know, opening hatch doors, transferring power from the shields to engineering, upgrading your spaceship, targeting enemies, ordering the crew around and handling all the PR.",

      "By Daniel Wallace", 
      "FTL: Faster Than Light is an addictive indie roguelike developed by Subset Games. Following its incredibly successful Kickstarter origins – in which over 1000% of the original $10,000 goal was pledged by over 4,000 backers – the game is now available directly from the game’s website or via Steam. FTL focuses on intergalactic exploration, space ship combat, diplomacy and the difficult roguelike experience. For the uninitiated, roguelikes are games defined by the aforementioned tricky gameplay, randomly generated universes and dreaded permanent death.", 
      "You are the captain and it is your responsibility to guide your ship, crew and precious cargo to the Federation – all the while piloting through the dangers of space, fighting off pirates and avoiding the Rebel fleet. You will also have the opportunity to forge allegiances with the galaxy’s variety of races; the Rock Men, Engies, Zoltans, Slugs and Mantises, each with their own specific traits and perks.", 
      "As captain, your crew is relying on you constantly for direction. Who will man the guns? Who will pilot the ship? Should full power go to the engines or the shields? Each of these decisions has their own bonuses when in combat with other ships. For example, assign a crew member to weapons and they will recharge faster after use, meaning you can keep up the pressure with faster attacks. Likewise, keep a crew member in their respective area for long enough and they will eventually be promoted, further increasing these bonuses.", 
      "This also makes it that much more painful to lose any of your crew. Take one missile too many to your engines and the Engi manning your shields will die, meaning you will have to shuffle around any remaining crew members – and desperately hope for a replacement.", 
      "When ‘jumping’ into a node your ship may come across another, whose intentions will become clear shortly after. The crew may want to trade, they may even need help (through one of the game’s numerous quests or in the form of a distress call) or they may simply want to destroy you – in which case you will have to deal with them accordingly.", 
      "FTL’s combat is reliant on both strategy and blind luck; the latter of which can be incredibly maddening at times. Picture the scene: after a long, drawn out battle with a Mantis pirate ship, your ship is bruised but not out for the count, your hull scarred but not destroyed. Your crew fought the fires bravely and did their best to patch up the ship’s systems. You jump to a new node and there’s yet another ship lying in wait. No – wait. That’s no ordinary pirate – this is a behemoth of a ship. Three shields, two missile systems, a pair of lasers and drones ready to tear away your shields and destroy what remains of your hull. In short, you’re in trouble.", 
      "You target their shields – without them you will be able to slowly take down their weapons and drone systems. Your first volley of shots all miss and the shields are still up. Okay, no big deal, you can get them once the guns are recharged… But you miss again, again and again. Meanwhile, the monstrosity you stumbled into is tearing away at your precious ship that you have guided so carefully until now, every single shot finding its mark. Your crew members start dying from the fires eating away at your ship from the inside and your systems go offline. All hope lost, your ship explodes. Game over.", 
      "Throughout your journey to the Federation fleet, you will come across a vast variety of multiple choice events. These events can have any number of repercussions depending on the choices you make. One such event sees you coming across a marooned crew member of some long-crashed ship on an isolated planet. You can decide between leaving him/her/it alone on the planet, or offering them a place on your crew. Bring them aboard and you can put them to work. However, what’s to say they are safe? Who knows how long they were left down there? They may have gone mad and attack the moment they are off that rock! The only way to know is to take a gamble.", 
      "There are also special ‘blue’ options available depending on your crew and how you have equipped your ship. These options will always be far more beneficial than a standard choice, usually offering bonus materials but sometimes even unlocking a new ship.", 
      "True to its roguelike nature, FTL generates the galaxy randomly every time you play. You may have to travel through nebulae, pirate controlled sectors, each of the race’s homeworlds or some other type of alien space. Each individual sector generates randomly each time, and whilst exploring them there are a number of environmental hazards you may be unfortunate enough to fall foul of.", 
      "Asteroid fields that will eat away at your ship (and thankfully, any other ship you may be locked in battle with), solar flares that ignite the interiors of any ship foolhardy enough to remain too close and ion storms that cut your ship’s available power in half. These hazards all encourage tactical play – especially the latter – but also generally infuriate; when in an ion storm without sufficient power, you usually have to decide which of your systems to power. Oxygen or shields, engines or drones; either way these fights are usually the trickiest in the game.", 
      "The most aggravating aspect of ion storms is the apparent immunity given to AI ships inside them. While your own reactor’s power is cut in half the same is never true of the enemy ship, often creating a scenario where a fully shielded hostile ship tears your hull apart with multiple weapons and drones while you struggle to manage your meagre power reserves between oxygen or engines.", 
      "This is not the only aspect of the game where it can feel as though something is missing. Throughout your journey you will come across a number of stores, each allowing you to trade ‘scrap’ for a variety of goods. Anything from new crew members, new weapons and augmentations that will improve your ship. While you can buy supplies from these vendors, you can only sell a selection of your excess resources. On occasion this can be disappointing, especially when you are only ten scrap short of that awesome upgrade you have been looking for while carrying more missiles than you will ever fire.", 
      "At first FTL is a surprisingly fun game. You will fail your mission a few times and maybe unlock a new ship. You will learn a few strategies and understand what to prioritise on your journey. Eventually this initial excitement will wear off, probably after your ship is torn apart yet again after falling on the wrong side of the random number generator a few times too many.", 
      "Fortunately, the game stays interesting through the randomly generated galaxy and by offering new ships to campaign with. For some reason you will still find yourself going back for more, albeit in smaller, more sporadic doses. Eventually you may even win a campaign, and in doing so rediscover that initial excitement. While being far from perfect, FTL remains entertaining for those able to shrug off many, many defeats.",

      "Coaxed into entering a raffle by the mysterious girl working the contest, Renya actually manages to be the lucky winner. His prize? Becoming God of course! The contest girl reveals herself to be an angel named Lilliel, who will help guide the protagonist into the world of being God. Soon enough, Renya and Lilliel are on their way to the heavenly world of Celestia, where they rub shoulders with a host of angels and other heavenly creatures.", 
      "Going further, the provided voice work, although certainly welcome, is more of a mixed bag. The voicing of Renya and Lilliel are the highlights here, but some of the characters either come off as bored (the angel Neliel) or extremely annoying (that zombie pictured above).", 
      "When you enter the Fate Revolution Complex in order to fulfill a wish, Renya and Lilliel are placed onto an isometric grid. Together, you two move across this grid, while keeping track of your health, energy and magic. Combat is your basic turn-based combat system, with you and Lilliel taking turns attacking enemies and vice-versa. It’s nothing too deep, but it certainly gets the job done.", 
      "The real depth to the gameplay comes from the absurd amount of items you can acquire. Both Renya and Lilliel can be equipped with five different items; head, left arm, right arm, legs and body. So, if you want, you can equip your characters with mushroom hats, a battle axe, an ice gauntlet, a car for legs and bat wings. While your character will look extremely goofy, each of these items has its own special attack. Figuring out which combination of items to use for each level is integral to being able to advance at all in the game. Plus, as you use each weapon in the dungeons, it will reach a burst point. By reaching burst status, you can bring the item to the local blacksmith in order to increase its power. You can do this time and time again in order to build up a high powered arsenal, which, of course, will help with clearing the many dungeons you traverse.", 
      "To continue, the other thing that you must do is learn to embrace death, which may sound hard to do at first, but after you die for the 50oth time you’ll kind of get used to it. Dying repeatedly will help unlock new features and abilities, which otherwise would not have been unlocked until later in the campaign.",

But this all changes when he crosses paths with a young girl (who is typically wearing a maids outfit) who’s hosting a raffle to win a grand prize: the chance to become a god. Not that Renya knew this at the time, but upon winning he’s soon struck by his bad luck and carted off to the world of Celestia. Now, it’s time for Renya to fulfil people’s wishes, but there’s an unknown evil lurking around the corner – one that’s hell bent on putting a stop to all of that.",

In execution, players only move the linear storyline forward, not really making decisions about each character’s destiny. While the design decision isn’t unusual for a Japanese game- where story telling is typically favored over the illusion of player autonomy, the absence of control may bewilder those accustomed to Western games.",

      "After the successful Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness, can Nippon Ichi Software deliver again with The Guided Fate Paradox ?", 
      "After years of bad luck with just about every scenario that comes into play, Renya Kagurazaka is a sarcastic high school student who mocks his own karma. After he stumbles across a lottery machine ticket at his local city mall, karma decides to talk back. Tempted by a young woman dressed as a maid Renya tries his luck, and much to his own surprise wins the draw. However Renya thinks the whole thing is a hoax and stands in embarrassment and is just about ready to leave, but not before he is knocked unconscious and transported to the magical lands of Celestia.", 
      "Here he awakens to find that this is not a hoax and that he really is in-fact turned into a super human being, and the girl in the shopping mall is infact a guardian named Lilliel Saotome, who has set him up to take on the role. From here on out Renya’s role in the game is to fulfill the wishes of the people and to do so by any means necessary. Using a machine called the Fate Revolution Circuit, Renya is able to battle the inner demons that people have inside their minds. These inner demons are the doubts, fears, and insecurities that plague people’s dreams and hopes that they have in order to better their lives. The entire game holds a sense of sarcasm and comedy that creeps up you when least expected.", 
      "Renya helps to better the lives of the people using not only the Fate Revolution Circuit, but also with the assistance of Lilliel. She plays two roles in the game, the first is that she’s Renya’s assistant for the bulk of the story or guardian if you will, no pun intended. The other being that she is the player’s hint and tutorial guide for the progress of the game. This does well to blend the technical aspects of the player who is playing the game, with the story and reasoning behind the character’s choices and interactions within the game. There’s a seamless transition between the two that works out well on both ends.", 
      "The play of stereo-typical male humour on the appearance of female cosplay is one that deserves credit. Renya’s dialogue as he greets the guardians are not to be missed. The game provides a few witty laughs along the way as Renya questions his role as super human being in reference to the laws of a video game. As the game is primarily a dungeon crawler Renya questions the idea of looting and finding HP items on the floor. In addition the game also crosses the fourth wall more than often which is laughable and noticeable as Renya’s sense of personality is both easy to relate to as it is convincing.", 
      "The Celestia works as a hub or a base for when the player is not taking part within the main section of the game. In the Celestia you are free to browse item shops, weapons, equipment, and talk to other beings. The main game takes place inside the Fate Revolution Circuit, which is traversed by exploring a series of floors which are home to different creatures and booby traps. The player is free to navigate the different floors at any time so long as they have access to the portals which link them together.", 
      "As you progress through the different floors, cut-scenes take place displaying the lives and status of the person you are helping. Your actions of helping a particular person by the means of battling opponents begins to have an effect on the world in which that person exists. The Fate Revolution Circuit copies specific environmental elements from the original world and mixes them in with that of the Celestial to create the Copy World. The game explains how all this works through the use of character dialogue, but it could do a better job of doing so. This ties into the story of the game in that Renya cannot directly help humans but must assist them through the machine in an effort to guide their thoughts. It’s a way for the Renya to help people out without ever having to come into contact with them physically.", 
      "Early hours into the game there’s a slight sense of mystery within the characters. This is rooted from their dialogue and their attitudes towards Renya. Among the beautiful creatures and the kind-hearted people of the Celestia you can’t help but get the feeling that there’s something sinister and maybe something a little twisted going on behind closed doors. Your need for a reason as to why Renya was chosen to be special is something you personally want to seek out.", 
      "The clown faced beings and Harpy style monsters don’t exactly blend in well with the human-like creatures that roam the Celestia. Their hierarchy structure of non-human like creatures being servants to the guardians played on my mind, and it constantly had me thinking that nothing is what it seems within the Celestia. It was this mystery along with Renya’s so-called “Lucky draw” that motivated me to go on with the game and see it through to the end.", 
      "One thing that stood out to me as a player is the method in which the game teaches you how to play. The game treats the player and Renya as one, the tutorial levelling where Lilliel teaches Renya his new abilities is the same way in which you are shown how to play the game. It’s a seamless integration that fools the player into believing that Renya’s tutorial is more to do with the story than the actual player learning the control scheme of the game. It works magnificently.", 
      "Playing in a similar method to Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness, the game uses a turn-based strategy system in which players must do battle with enemies in the form of a grid, where each enemy engages an attack one after the other. Where The Guided Fate Paradox does things different lies in its freedom to move about the battle grid when the player desires, rather than having to do so in the form of an action that’s part of your actual turn. It also uses this sense of freedom in its method of using items and equipping weapons. The player’s combat options are paired up with a 6-skill attribute system that has a specific effect on enemy types.", 
      "Renya has the ability to heal outside of battle without the need of an item which contradicts the game’s use of finding and buying items from the game’s store even though they come in handy once you’re in battle, which the self-healing does not. Although there’s no options for co-operative play there is the ability to travel with your guardians and have them assist you in battle. A more interesting method of raising your stats and abilities is by use of the Divinigram. The Divinigram acts as a gym for more advanced player upgrades. Here you are able to plant specific items into a panel-like structure which raises your base strength for that given item type.", 
      "Planting the a  relic for example increases your attacking hit points while others will allow you to attack more often within a given turn and become more aware to evasive manuvoures. Unlike other items and equipment that you attach in order to increase your chance of survival and strengthening your attacks, which are lost and reset if you should lose all your health, your base stats which you improve in the Divinigram are not lost but are permanent.", 
      "The guardians are able to heal you, throw you at enemies, and pass on their items. They can also take on a different attitude towards the battles, with the choices of being more defensive, covering the player, and being full on aggressive. The game extends upon this with the options to equip and switch items with your companions, as well as give orders to execute special abilities known as Divine Skill. These special attacks are available to you depending on what weapons you are equipped with and plays out in a stylish anime-like cut-scene.", 
      "As the guardians accompany you and are able to freely move you when in battle, this also means they are free to attack and you do not have direct control over their actions. While this is handy in certain situations it can be troublesome when you wish to approach an enemy in a particular way or sneak past them. But because your partner has already taken it upon herself to engage the enemy first, you are unable to do so.", 
      "When you’re not taking part in immediate battles you are free to wonder the available areas within the Celestia. Although these areas are not that great in size the choice of doing so allows you to interact with other characters within the world, and increase your immersion. The Celestia is a hub so the sense of huge exploration in comparison to what goes on in the Fate Revolution Circuit is not needed. The game already does a terrific job of immersing you within its storyline and Renya’s character, the walkabout nature of the hub still compliments the game and is a nice implementation.", 
      "The game also adds a light customisation element whereby you can rename each of your weapons by visiting the Cigamis. As you progress through the game you’ll find more and more options for item techniques and upgrades, as well as more stores becoming available for customization purposes. Just visiting these stores and wondering around the Celestia opens up more background information of its world, thanks to the talkative nature of the creatures that inhabit it.", 
      "The game’s visual style shares similarities to that of Nippon Ichi’s other titles, primarily Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness. The visuals aren’t bad by any means but the need for changing things up a little in order to distinguish the two titles is really down to personal preference. The game looks amazing in its own right and the anime art style that exist within the cut-scenes go hand in hand with the personalities of the game’s characters. The game boast many different environments that are discovered as you play on and as they are all very distinct from the last, the effort in its level design is appreciable and compliments its visual theme.", 
      "The improvements and exploration that the game has taken is a leap above Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness, and because of the close similarities between them the changes here are very well noticeable. The Guided Fate Paradox is rewarding in its storytelling and does well to hook you from the beginning. Those who see it through to the end will not be disappointed.", 
      "This game was reviewed on the PlayStation 3.", 
      "The game’s storyline alone is enough to keep players going and the rest is a well-deserved bonus.", 
      "The only hiccup in my experience of the game was the non-optional aspect of adjusting the difficulty in reference to losing the equipment and items I had gained while travelling through the worlds. This became a pain but is countered by the aspect of challenge and decision making.", 
      "The Guided Fate Paradox mixes warm and quirky humour with a light sense of comedy that manages to blend storytelling and gameplay into one seamless execution.",

      "As God, it’s up to Renya to answer prayers that have been filtered by a machine known as the Fate Revolution Circuit, and guide the fate of those who called for his help by granting their wish. He does so by entering the Circuit and going into the Copy World, a dungeon that’s a copy of the Original World, stripped down to the bare essentials relating to the wish. By defeating aberrations, manifestations of mental obstacles keeping the wisher from changing their own fate, that appear in the randomly generated dungeons, Renya is able to fulfill his duty as God and grant the desire of those who have prayed to him.", 
      "For starters, you and your angel partner are able to equip your head, two arms, torso, and legs with insane weapons and armor. Your equipment is reflected on your character, so if you equip those bat wings to your torso or that car to your legs, your appearance will change accordingly.", 
      "Each piece of equipment, regardless if it’s weapon or armor, has a special skill for you to use. Doing so drains your SP meter, but like your health, it regenerates with each step you take. Unfortunately, your energy meter is constantly draining, and you’ll have to make sure to eat to keep it from bottoming out and draining your health.", 
      "After constant use, equipment will “burst,” causing a slight decrease in strength while granting you Holy Icons (more on those in a minute). You can reset the “burst” status on your equipment by upgrading it at the blacksmith, which also gives you more time to use the equipment before it “bursts” again.", 
      "Whenever you die in one of the game’s many unique and diverse dungeons, not only do you lose all of your equipment and everything in your item pouch, but the level you were inside of resets. Still, leveling up is essential as even though you’re level one each time you enter a dungeon, the levels you gained are added to your Total Level, which are your base stats (eventually you can trade in levels from your Total Level for rare items).", 
      "Holy Artifacts, meanwhile, grant you special skills and abilities. The downside is that they have to be placed on top of Icons, thus negating their effects. And because Icons can only be placed next to each other, it gets tricky trying to craft your Divinigram to give you ideal results for both you and your angel partner.", 
      "Perhaps my only complaint with the game is that, at times, the story can really drag. And good God (pun intended), does this game have a slow burn! On top of an optional tutorial, the entire first chapter holds your hand, bringing the flow of the game to a snail’s pace as you watch a cutscene or listen to your angel partner explain something you’ve probably already figured out by now.", 
      "@leevikoskivuori:disqus: Blasphemous as I may sound, I actually encourage purchasing “The Guided Fate Paradox” over “Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness.”", 
      "Why is that?", 
      "I’m curious about your reasoning on this as well. I enjoyed D2, though after about 60 hours I stopped, as between Pringer Z and Baal there’s just way too much of a grind.",

      "And that’s where things get a little weird. You have won – divinity. That’s right, you’re god now, no backsies. And so begins your journey, as the cute lottery girl (your personal angel), whisks you off to Celestia to prepare you to grant the wishes of the people (all of them) using the Fate Revolution Circuit. The characters are pretty standard for anime/jrpg, and so there is plenty of suggestive conversation and young girls in questionable outfits, but it works well with the story and never tips over into creepy (which is something that can be difficult to balance).", 
      "There’s an awful lot to take in at the beginning of The Guided Fate Paradox, as you learn the ins and outs of the machine as well as the mechanics of the game. The idea is that, rather than directly granting prayers, god enters the Fate Revolution Circuit to influence that world, which in turn will influence the real world. It’s basically a dungeon crawler, with a somewhat different battle system where each time you make a move, the enemy creatures all get a shot as well. This mechanic makes forethought and strategy even more vital than in a standard rpg formula, but it also makes for some really interesting play. Add in that you have a whole lot of choices in the angels you take into battle with you, as well as how they behave, and there is an awful lot of things to take in. Fear not though, the game does a great job of introducing mechanics a little at a time, explaining each one thoroughly in an easily understood fashion. And learn you must, because everything is not heavenly in Celestia, and evil forces are plotting to overthrow your newly acquired heavens.", 
      "The Guided Fate Paradox is a game with so many different facets and levels that it seems impossible to ever master it all – and yet, it is all presented in a way that somehow makes sense. Players are guided into each system in order to keep things approachable, and how deep you want to get into the strategy of each aspect is up to you. While the controls aren’t always ideal, and the mechanics take a little work to master, for the most part this is a game that will just keep you coming back for more."

      "In The Guided Fate Paradox, you get to play God. Being a Nippon Ichi Software game though, the physical embodiment of God is assigned to an adolescent teenager on the verge of puberty. Naturally.", 
      "Renya Kagurazaka is a typical Japanese teenager, unremarkable in every way. All that was about to change after a fateful encounter with Liliel, a girl dressed in a maid outfit tending to a lottery machine. Succumbing to his base desires, Renya decides to throw caution to the wind and play the luck of the draw in an attempt to impress the girl. Little does he know what lies in wait for him. For this isn’t any ordinary lottery machine you see, the grand prize  being chosen to assume the role of God. Our unsuspecting hero is not aware of this minor detail however and chalks up the win to a change in his rotten luck. It’s only when he is knocked out and taken to Celestia that he realizes that it’s still as rotten as ever. Waiting for him there are an assortment of angels all inexplicably dressed up in maid and butler outfits. Each with their own set of ideals except for one thing they all have in common. None of them take the new God seriously. At least not until Renya proves himself worthy of the title. So how does our hero go about doing this? That’s when things get interesting.", 
      "Renya’s main responsibility as God is to fulfill the wishes of his followers. As compensation for his lack of experience and power, a machine called the Fate Revolution Circuit helps narrow down wishes that are more pertinent to his current level. Initially these wishes are all handpicked by the angels each coming with its own set of moral dilemmas. The motive behind this is to ascertain whether Renya is even up to the task of Godhood all the while molding his personality, imbuing him with the qualities they deem befitting of God. The narrative manages to elevate itself eventually from a tedious first half full of inappropriate and unfunny moments. It takes its time but it finally does pick up.", 
      "In order to fulfill each wish, Renya has to navigate through a place called Copy World. Only accessible though the Fate Revolution Circuit, Copy World is a replica of the real world except that it’s teeming with monsters. The fate of both worlds, Copy and Original, is intertwined. Any changes made in the Copy World directly alter events happening in the real world.  This is where you’ll be spending the majority of your time in the game. Each wish has its own unique dungeon consisting of randomly generated maps. The Guided Fate Paradox plays out like a typical rogue-like/dungeon-crawler with a nod to Disgaea and a few tricks all its own.", 
      "Let’s get one thing out of the way, The Guided Fate Paradox is an incredibly hard game. The tutorials and the deceptively easy first few levels might make it seem like a breeze initially. It’s not. Once the gloves come off, they stay off. Be prepared to constantly be ravaged by random traps and monsters appearing out of thin air when you least expect them. Death in a dungeon has severe repercussions as well, robbing the player of all their possessions and half the coin they’ve accumulated. Furthermore, level grinding is rendered near useless by the fact that the character in play is reverted back to level one every time they leave a dungeon. One benefit of level grinding still remains though, the base stats of the character increase whenever leaving a dungeon as well. So even though the character will always have to start at level one whenever entering a new dungeon, it’ll always be a stronger level one than before. The level design for the dungeons might seem a bit generic as is the case with most games of the genre. Though the art style might look generic, it is counteracted by different methods of traversal. You’ll be jumping off medieval rooftops one moment while traveling across a revolving library the next. The varied locales play into the strategy of clearing a level, they’re not just for show (actually they’re not for show at all, we’ve established that). The cherry on top is the creative boss battles at the end of every dungeon. With new elements of game play being introduced constantly throughout the game, it never ceases to entertain.", 
      "At a glance, The Guided Fate Paradox appears to be a Disgaea skin-job through and through. Considering that the development team is largely comprised of people from the Disgaea team, comparisons were inevitable but it goes beyond that. It’s just downright sloppy at times. Assets from the Disgaea games seem to have been reused here particularly the character animations. Another thing it retains is the dated visuals. They look even worse here, lacking the polish the Disgaea series has garnered over the years. The only saving grace is the hand-drawn sprites. These games have never been about the visuals really though. What it lacks in visuals, it more than makes up for in the game play department.", 
      "The Guided Fate Paradox is a great example of never judging a book by its cover. Beneath its seemingly shallow exterior is a deep and rewarding experience for those bold enough to venture through it. It definitely ranks amongst Nippon Ichi Software’s finest.",

      "In regards to Cinderella, let’s say we create an entirely original scenario, how does the player know that the player is changing fate? Since it’s new, who knows what would have happened to that character to begin with? Whereas we have Cinderella to begin with, we all know how Cinderella’s story turns out. In this case, players are able to see maybe what a different motivation for Cinderella would be for her to want her fate to change and also players will be able to compare her new fate and old fate. I thought that’s the easiest example to show that way of before and after of fate changing.",

Or they really do want her to have her own game. I don’t know anymore! [Laughs.]",

      "But just making her a MC… No, I don’t think so. It would kill the joke, permanently. But hey, NIS knows it’s stuff so if it happens I’m sure they will come up with a very clever and interesting idea that won’t let me down. So yeah, voting up.", 
      "I don’t think so. With Disgaea D2 coming out, I can definitely see the joke somewhat continuing, though this time she’ll be asking for a sequel. And if they wanna keep that joke, they’ll just have to give all the other NI games a sequel.",

      "*explodes* Z.H.P had more charm than any Disgaea though, what do you mean..? :/", 
      "And yes man, I’d actually like Asagi to be the main character of her own game~!", 
      "Speaking as someone who loves Disgaea, WHAT?!", 
      "It had equal, if not greater, charm than Disgaea BECAUSE of that.", 
      "I’m hyped for Guided Paradox either way.", 
      "The man is out of touch with superhero fans, clearly. I found ZHP’s charm and writing, overall, to be N1′s best work by a landslide.", 
      "I’m not sure how well ZHP sold, but it seems like Sohei-san was referring more to mass appeal. It didn’t have the broad appeal of something like Disgaea.", 
      "As a toku fan though, ZHP was the first Nippon Ichi game that really appealed to me. So I guess appealing to a niche may yet pay off, if new fans pick up The Guided Fate Paradox.", 
      "I’ve wanted Asagi to be the MC since they started trolling us in Makai Kingdom, so if that ever happens I’m on full support.", 
      "The 24 people who don’t know who Asagi is need to be informed, she is the best ever. Yes I want her to have her own game finally, but I still want her to make cameos too.", 
      "I want Asagi to have her own game ONLY if she is the not the main character of her own game. The main character would be a friend she met, and she would be the secondary character tagging along. They did ask if she would have her own game and in this sense she would but not as the main character. They said nothing about should have her own game and being the main character.", 
      "It’s implied she’d be the MC. Being a secondary character =/= having her own game, it would be her friend’s game.", 
      "Yeah it’s not your game if you’re not the main character. There’s no working around that.", 
      "Maybe Asagi should get a mini game where she is the main character.Just like in prinny,that was a lot of fun.", 
      "I want N1 to pretend to make an Asagi game. She can have her name in the title and everything. However, she isn’t actually the main character. She’s busy off in other worlds breaking into other games, so she misses her chance. Therefore each chapter has a different N1 character cosplaying as Asagi as a stand-in.", 
      "Finally she shows up and crashes her own game during the final boss sequence.", 
      "This is genius-level trolling, a game like this would be legendary.", 
      "If they do this, I will love them forever.", 
      "I love it!", 
      "Holy crap, this would be hilarious. Making reference to all the games that she made cameos in. I’d seriously buy that.", 
      "That would be the best game ever", 
      "That’d be cool, but again that wouldn’t make it *her* game.", 
      "Well as of this statement I’m officially releasing my Asagi Game idea to the public domain, so if N1 wants to use it they can go right ahead.", 
      "GodDAMMIT, N1, cut this guy a damn check already!", 
      "This.", 
      "Her stoicism is zen-like and her character has so many applications. Throw her in any situation and in any outfit and she’ll just fit. NIS needs this.", 
      "Pleinair fans unite!", 
      "She is also Harada’s mascot so based on official art of her outside of Disgaea she has a lot of potential.", 
      "Or have Laharl show up ranting about how she stole a main character position from him, or have Mao want to experiment on a main character, or any number of other things. NIS is good at silly. Really, I agree with the people who feel the running gag is played out.", 
      "Well, with Disgaea D2 coming out, they can just change the joke to her wanting a sequel, especially if NI listens to the demands for the other games to get sequels.", 
      "“there’s one that the players’ head can be a tuna head.”", 
      "Valvatorez: You fool! How can the president of the company that made my game not know the difference between a tuna and a sardine!? Come Fenrich! We shall march to their headquarters in Gifu and demand an explanation!", 
      "“All is for my lord…”", 
      "Emizel: *Sweat drop* “here we go again…”", 
      "I’d be disappointed if she got her own game. The joke would more or less fall apart. She’d change from being a funny cameo character, to a fanservice cameo character (like when other NIS main characters appear). It would kill the one thing that makes her interesting and likable.", 
      "I absolutely adore Asagi’s design, but I HATE how they turned her into a promo character for her own game in Makai Kingdom to the way she is now. I really hope if she does get her own game, they don’t make it too over-the-top and make it more like Soul Nomad in terms of the mood of the story.", 
      "If people wanted drama, they would have bought Phantom Brave!", 
      "Okay, joking aside, I wouldn’t mind it being a little less over the top. Heck, her Makai Kingdom appearance kinda hinted that it may have been like that.", 
      "Precisely what I was saying. It was clear in Makai Kingdom that Asagi was supposed to have a much different personality than she has now and was obviously put in the game to promote Makai Wars, though since that project was cancelled we now have a completely different character who I would NOT want to see get her own game if she’s going to act like a fool all the time. NIS has too many hammy games and I wish they’d tone it back at least from time to time. Soul Nomad, as I mentioned earlier, easily trumps every other game they’ve made (at least storywise) just because the mood was a great balance of being comedic and dramatic, at least IMO.", 
      "Asagiception hahahaha", 
      "It’s the OTHER A-virus? :P", 
      "I’m buying this game for the maid… NOW DO THE SACRED MAID TWIRLER!!",

      "Also I want to know what is the canon ending for La Pucelle? Did Priere really turn into an Overlord? Also make Marjoly appear in Disgaea D2.", 
      "Priere becoming an Overlord is not part of the ending in La Pucelle. Rather, it’s a title she can optionally earn in the Dark World.", 
      "So what about the Overlord Priere that has been appearing in the Disgaea series? Is she someone that came from an alternate dimension then?", 
      "Priere can become an Overlord during an optional event in the Dark World, which has zero effect on the main storyline. Her cameo appearances are based on the assumption that she did so during the events of La Pucelle.", 
      "I’ve been looking around the ‘net for info about the Overlord Priere mode in the re-release of La Pucelle.. And I think it fits because she is an Overlord in title only as she was still kind.", 
      "So which Priere do you prefer?", 
      "The remake however has turned in into an actual storyline path and it retcons the last two chapters of the original game.", 
      "It’s still unclear if it’s canon or not, but they still managed to make a coherent story out of it.", 
      "Asagi Can “I” really be the hero.", 
      "Asagi Can “I” really be the hero.", 
      "Asagi has a very flat personality (like most side characters.) They’d have to flesh out her story and make her goal almost Disney-esque to give the player enough feeling.", 
      "She involves herself in a lot of other games and worlds, so I could see her in a Makai Kingdom-like game that’s designed around NIS as a whole. It could be a rather fulfilling adventure, and I can see Asagi turning into quite the character if they gave her a more rounded personality outside of her outbursts and strive.", 
      "Plenair is an interesting choice (A Very good one, too), but i think that there is already a good basic for a game that would have Asagi trying to be the main character…", 
      "Since her cameo’s have changed personality and *Spoler* Disgaea 4 has her malice and desperation re-active “Fear The Great”, and overall has a nearly mental breakdown and emo-style intro *Spoler:End* She has already evolved mentally along the series… I wouldn’t leave these un-used :)", 
      "Though Plenair using that Bunny as a mace/axe-combo weapon would be fun to watch :D", 
      "I voted “yes”. As ppl said, the 4th wall Asagi joke can go many ways like how she now rant abt getting a sequel… ‘sides, i wouldn’t mind Asagi as a 4th wall tastic MC.", 
      "So how are we changing a zombie fate? Find him a true love? De-zombify him?", 
      "EDIT: If you have something to say abt my opinion, how ’bout telling me instead of downvoting me?",

      "Eight years since they first introduced Asagi? Woa, that’s a lot of time.", 
      "Sure we want her as a main character! She’s always the one I end up leveling to insane level when playing Disgaea and its relatives (and I loved her mode in the sequel of Prinny for PSP), now it’s time to shine in her own game, c’mon <3", 
      "I’d would totally love to see Asagi start in her own video game. really would make my day! (:", 
      "Part of me wants Asagi to get her game…part of me wants Asagi to get her game, but not without a large amount of catches and trolling.", 
      "For example… she gets her game… where she is the final boss that every other N1 main character brand together to defeat!", 
      "And yes, I am aware of the Prinny games… I mean an actual game and not just an extra story.",

      "Asagi is told she is able to revive Makai Wars but it ends up being a bug infested beta and her role is confusing because the original Asagi is still in the game due to simply finishing the original source code.", 
      "I’d be down for an Asagi game if they done one thing", 
      "They have the title/intro have “Makai Wars” on some big flashy sign, only for it to fall over and reveal it was really made of cheap cardboard. Then the actual title comes in.", 
      "…actually, now that I think about it, wouldn’t all her appearances equal a game itself? Like have all her cameos in games be boss battles. It would be a pretty neat concept actually", 
      "I hope Asagi gets her own game but not in a Srpg.", 
      "Given that she likes heavy military artillery, my guess would be… a Third Person Shooter? A Japanese Third Person Shooter that stars Asagi, and developed by NIS. Or better yet, a Contra-style game for her!", 
      "I voted for Asagi own game, basically the running joke about her having not game and just being a cameo has become boring, honest. I also curious about her, having a girl with guns with her personality is fun for a main character.", 
      "Personally, I’d love to have an Asagi game. Sadly, she’s become a bit crazy, developing multiple personalities due to game whiplash. If she does get a game, I just hope they give it a genuine plot and not overshadow it with cameo jokes.", 
      "Agreed. Just look how natural Takehiro Harada work looks compared to Noizi Ito in the last image in the article", 
      "You know, I’ve been itching for years for a game like Lunar. Just a simple, light hearted, and fun traditional turnbased RPG. And like Lunar, Asagi turns bad in the middle of the game, claiming that she’s not getting enough attention as the “main character”. So she plans to enslave the world and force the respect she feels she deserves. Throw in a sappy love story, and I think we got a game.", 
      "At the same time, after Disgaea 2 came out, Laharl has been invading other netherworlds just so he could get his new game….",

      "Yeah give us the Asagi game.", 
      "a Asagi game would be awesome! also lookin forward to The Guided Fate Paradox! anybody know if this game is goin to have eng VA/dub?(hope it dose)…",

      "— For those who aren’t familiar with The Guided Fate Paradox, could you briefly introduce the story and system of the game for us?", 
      "Essentially, he has to enter a machine called the Fate Revolution Circuit, in which he guides the fates of those who have prayed or wished for help. By taking care of the obstacles in their mind (that just happen to exist as monsters in the machine), Renya can help these individuals overcome their doubts and make a change in their life.", 
      "I wouldn’t call the story “dark,” per se, but it tells a much more serious story with more realistic repercussions. You really get the sense that you, as Renya, are literally dropped into a world steeped in millennia of history, and that your angels know much more about your job, the world, and each other than you do. The game presents its world in a really cool way, I feel.", 
      "— The name of this game sounds unusual at first, but as you consider it in relation to the content, it really begins to make sense. How difficult was it to find a translated name for this game that you were comfortable with?", 
      "Long story short, it was about as difficult as any other title! I think we nailed it with this one, though. It brings together the concept of “fate” that is ever-present in the game’s narrative, your main duty of “guiding” these fates, and the paradox that you, as God, are actually helping people make their own decisions—a “paradox” that stands at odds with the idea of “free will.”", 
      "Even so, because he associates with angels for most of the game, he stands out. The angels are stiff, formal, and in a way, they’re naive or even ignorant about humanity. It makes for an interesting dichotomy with Renya, who values very “human” things.", 
      "Renya’s actually pretty hot-blooded, too. It takes him a while to embrace his new duties, but when he does, he puts everything he’s got into doing what needs done.", 
      "— Is there a favorite angel at the office? If so, who and why?", 
      "I personally like Lilliel, the main angel who helps Renya, because you get to see her growth throughout the story, whereas the other angels are pretty set in their ways. It’s interesting to see how interacting with a human can change how an angel shows emotion, or approaches delicate situations. Plus, she’s absolutely adorable!", 
      "Certain types of weapons and armor give you specific tiles as they Burst. For instance, Bursting a sword will get you an ATK+ tile. Bursting a shield will get you a DEF+ tile, and so on. Figuring out what gets you what is important, especially if you want to maximize the boost to affect all the different stats!", 
      "— Voice-acting is always a fairly big concern when it comes to RPGs. Do you have any idea how much of the story will be voiced, or is that still in the planning stages?", 
      "— Finally, is there anything else you’d like to tell us about the game as long as we’re here?", 
      "Also, as a huge fan of Noizi Ito’s art, being able to work on a game that she contributed to was such an honor for me. I hope that all the hard work everyone put into this game helps to make it shine. Please enjoy it for hundreds of hours, or stop after experiencing the main story. As Lilliel would say, “It is up to you, Lord!”", 
      "Mmm, dat ancient cave.", 
      "NIS games usually are. By the way, if you have any other questions, feel free to add them in the comments here and I’ll see if I can get them answered.", 
      "Love the opening song for this game. I have it set as my wake up alarm. It’s so loud.", 
      "Sweet. And props for the choice of questions, they answer a lot of my questions.", 
      "And, since I can send my questions, I want to ask if it was hard to license all the tracks in the game, since the opening song isn’t the only tack made by Yosei Teikoku", 
      "NIS almost certainly planned to send this one to NISA from the very start, so I don’t think it would’ve been hard to get the tracks. ^^ It might even have been in the original contracts, actually…", 
      "Oh, that’s good to know", 
      "I was surprised when I found out those were Boss Themes in the actual game, so it made me wonder how hard it was to license those themes", 
      "As near as I’ve heard, games almost never have licensing troubles for music unless they’re an Idol game (and that’s a veeeeery specific niche). It’s one thing if the songs are themselves licensed from elsewhere, but if they’re made for the game, there’s rarely a problem to KEEP them in the game. Mind you, publishing soundtracks with them outside of Japan is a apparently a completely different story…", 
      "Oh, so there is a difference between licensing soundtracks for “normal games” and Idol games?", 
      "Though it was the same hassle. Thank you", 
      "Idols are big business in Japan. If it’s their songs, permission for use can get… complicated. More so than usual because, among other things, there’s a bigger concern about reverse-importing to get that content at a lower price. XD But that’s a whole different subject and WAY too deep to get into here.", 
      "exclusive interview?", 
      "cool!", 
      "you should do more of these gematsu!", 
      "It’s nice to read interviews. Thank you.", 
      "I like almost every NISA game and this one seems nice.", 
      "Is the level capped at 99 or 9999? Cause I absolutely hated Disgaea for being capped at 9999, it made me feel like hours of work were only drops in the ocean", 
      "GFP is a very different type of game from Disgaea. Your level CONSTANTLY goes back to 1, but you keep your total levels, which ultimately raises your basic strength. The cap for total levels in ZHP was 999,999 (yes, six digits), and I don’t think this will be lower… and it’s not counting whatever you’ve gained for levels inside a particular dungeon.", 
      "I wish more games had the same level (transmigration) system", 
      "So it doesnt feel like an infinite treadmill like disgaea?", 
      "That depends on how you look at it. I’m not sure it’s a good plan to compare the games too closely, though; ZHP/GFP and Disgaea are very different genres of games, and best judged individually rather than in comparison to each other. However, I did feel that ZHP was good about giving a feeling of constant growth and development, and I expect that to carry over here.", 
      "I’m getting this just because I love Disgaea & it’s their team behind it", 
      "The protagonist becomes God from winning a mall lottery, yet it has a fairly serious story.", 
      "NIS is pretty amazing at mixing humor with serious plots, yeah. ^^ Although I do wonder why they (the group seeking a new God) picked that particular method to find one…", 
      "Well, according to them, the angels are pretty naive when it comes to humans. Makes sense for me (Even though I kinda feel spoiled)", 
      "you can never go wrong with Noizi Ito’s art", 
      "Really hyped for this game, but what I really want to know is this: Will we ever see more of ZHP?", 
      "Of that game? Probably not. There’s a reason they decided to advance to GFP instead of making a direct sequel, so I wouldn’t expect too much in the way of the characters returning for anything except cameos. Of course, they made Disgaea D2, so you never know what they might decide to return to sometime in the future… but if they do have any plans, I doubt they’ll answer until they’re good and ready. ^^", 
      "God, I wish this was on Vita. I haven’t played so Grind-Heavy a game on consoles in a long time: feel like it’s going to be such a chore, whereas with Handheld and Standby options I never get overwhelmed by grinding.", 
      "Still excited: Z.H.P. is, in my mind, one the 3 biggest Sleeper Hits on the PSP; it’s a truly remarkable game with great gameplay, story-telling, art, and just everything. I was genuinely blown away by the game, and am really excited for Paradox now— although boy do I wish it was on Vita as well.", 
      "I hope this game don’t get skipped for Disgaea D2…..", 
      "Too bad about the story and art. Z.H.P. had so much charm and personality, this one looks a bit generic and dull in comparison.", 
      "Oh, I wouldn’t judge it too quickly. One thing NIS is good at is creating fun characters, so there’s probably a lot to enjoy. NISA’s planning a stream in the near future, so why not watch that before you decide?", 
      "Great interview~", 
      "Excellent interview, I’d like to see more on Gematsu, especially with companies like NISA and Aksys, etc.",

    "http://www.sggaminginfo.com/2014/01/the-guided-fate-paradox-review/": [
      "Renya Kagurazaka, a typical high school student was never the luckiest person in the world, he never won a lottery or anything for that matter, but one day on the way home from shopping a girl in a maid outfit convinces him to try his luck in her mall lottery. After reluctantly accepting Renya takes part and to his surprise he wins the grand prize, and what is the grand prize you ask? Oh, just becoming God. Yes, in The Guided Fate Paradox you play as a newly chosen God. Renya’s mission as God is to listen to everyone prayers and answer as many as possible, and to make matters worse for him its isn’t just the prayers of humans he has to answer it is also the prayers of those from the past, future, fairytale characters, and more. However the task isn’t that insane as he has his own personal angel, Lilliel Saotome, the girl who convinces him to take part in the mall lottery. With the help of Lilliel and six other angels you as the newly chosen God must grant prayers chosen by a powerful machine called the “Fate Revolution Circuit”. But, there is more than meets the eye in Renya’s new life as the angels keep secrets such as why he has to answer prayers, what is his purpose as God etc.", 
      "For the most part the stories in the Fate Revolution Circuit do a great job of holding my attention as they create an interesting cast of characters from a zombie who is being bullied to Cinderella who is sick of her life as a fairy tale character. The game’s overall story did a good job of keeping my attention, especially how angels and devils were portrayed. In world of The Guided Fate Paradox nothing is truly black or white.", 
      "The game’s main characters are a hit and miss they can be funny, but their humour isn’t for everyone. Each character has their own personality with Cheriel an ex-devil loving to use innuendos whenever she can, and Kuroiel who loves to cook food and eat with her fellow angels. The game’s main protagonist, Renya is probably my favourite character, he is a reluctant character at first, he doesn’t believe he is God, but once told he has no other choice, he admits he’s God and follows the advice of the angels. With that said he isn’t blind and you can see him question what is going around him. The characters really are something of an acquired taste and if you have never playing an NIS America published game before then you might not enjoy their personalities.", 
      "One thing that I can’t complain about is the voice work for the main characters. The English dub is close to perfect, the actors/actresses do an amazing job of expressing the characters feelings and some of their quirky personalities. This is definitely a game that should be heard in English even if you are Japanese audio purest.", 
      "The strongest aspect of The Guided Fate Paradox is its combat system. The system requires you to use strategy as one false move can lead to your death and the loss of all your hard earned items.", 
      "Yes, the game’s combat isn’t exactly forgiving as the penalty for dying is that you lose all the items you were holding at the time of death. To add to this the game throws in two more additional challenges with a strict levelling system and a energy bar that makes you complete you want to reach the final floor of the dungeon as soon as possible. When you enter a dungeon you start at level 1 and so the first thing you need to do inside the dungeon is level up as quickly or else you will be left defenceless in the latter levels, so with this in mind you are likely to grind as many levels as possible before reaching the end, but there is a catch. If you spend too much time levelling you risk burning up all your energy and dying, you can counteract this by eating certain items, but these items are scarce. This is where strategy really comes into play as you have to make a plan before entering a dungeon – you can stock up on food and try and force your way through, but if you do that you won’t be able to pick up as many items and you run the risk of losing on your energy before you even get to the end.",

Couple the war with the fact that at least some of his angels have questionable loyalties, while others have ego problems, and we’ve got an interesting and problematic world that Renya’s been thrust into. And to think, all this came about because a cute girl dressed as a cosplay maid asked him to give a spin to the lottery machine and then smacked him over the head with a blunt object after he had won.", 
      "Combat needs some getting used to. It’s mostly because of the fact that during regular floors of dungeons, you have a party of at least one other helper angel. However, when you get to the boss of each dungeon, you have to fight alone even if the boss doesn’t. There could’ve been either a stronger narrative explanation and build up to the angel not being able to help during the boss battles. But then again, that’s just a personal gripe."

      "The Guided Fate Paradox is one of those games that’s almost unnecessary to review: If the idea of an irreverent Japanese roguelike-visual novel hybrid with a bunch of interlocking character advancement systems, awash in anime tropes appeals to you, there’s no reason not to buy it right now. If you’re the kind of person that gets upset just thinking about that, you should probably move on by. For the few who’re curious but not committed, let’s figure out if you’re going to be into it!", 
      "The Guided Fate Paradox is about Renya, a Japanese teenager who’s had terrible luck all his life. After winning a lottery, he’s selected to be God, and whisked away to Celestia, where he’s attended by angels, all dressed as maids and butlers, who assist him in granting prayers. All of the characters, at least on the surface, seem like pretty typical anime stock characters, from the naïve girl who provides innuendo with a straight face for the protagonist to react to, to the amorous older woman who refers to herself as a big sister, from the straightforward sporty girl to the girl who insists she has magical powers.", 
      "Everyone’s got something past the surface, though, and the game’s visual novel scenes are awash with references to secret rules, gossip about the new God, and double dealings between Celestia and the Netherworld. This is all delivered through cutscenes before, after, and in the middle of dungeons, which are really the meat of the game. Each dungeon is based around fulfilling a wish, whether it’s from a fictional character, or someone from another world.", 
      "The graphics are beautiful, with HD sprites, great environments, and strong character designs. It especially makes gear loadouts a joy, as the piles of weird crap you can equip are all rendered on Renya’s sprite (Though, strangely, not in the world, where they instead use generic images for their gear type). The music is great as well, especially when it starts to get heavy, with the opening theme being a standout.", 
      "The dungeons are pretty typical Japanese roguelike fare. If you’ve ever played a Pokémon Mystery Dungeon game, or Azure Dreams back on the original PlayStation, you’ve got a pretty good idea what you’re going to be coming into here. The dungeons are turn-based, isometric affairs, where you’re trying to get to the bottom of the dungeon to kill a boss, before you starve to death or get killed by enemies or traps.", 
      "You’re going to die. A lot, really. It’s the nature of the genre that eventually, you’re going to get in over your head, be swarmed by enemies, and have no escape item. But that’s not too bad! Your equipped items- which are the source of your powers and some of your stat upgrades- will all go away, but you’ll find more as you go. Every time you enter a dungeon for the first time, and whenever you die, your level is reset to 1, but each time you level up, and when you power up weapons, you increase your maximum stats. So, really, as long as you’re playing, you’ll slowly get stronger, making it so that, even in the roughest dungeons, you won’t run up against an impossible obstacle.", 
      "To help further ease the situation, you can eventually bring any of your angels into the dungeon. They’ll help you fight, without using up any of your resources, making them better than a lot of roguelike pets already. Each has a special power, and you can set their AI to match the situation you find yourself in. It works a lot better than I was expecting, and even if they die, that just changes the situation from a methodical dungeon crawl to a mad dash to the bottom, where you’ll fight the boss without your angel, even if they’ve survived.", 
      "It’s a pretty tight formula, but I found myself somewhat annoyed by the game’s structure of sandwiching dialogue and cutscenes between floors. Part of a good roguelike is getting into the flow, and being able to knock out one floor after another. The Guided Fate Paradox regularly interrupts your progress, making each short floor feel like something to itself, rather than part of a whole. While this only happens on your first run through any given dungeon, it can make it hard to enjoy the dungeon on its own merits as you go.", 
      "The Guided Fate Paradox isn’t one of my favorite games, but then, my tastes in anime and roguelikes both differ from what the game immerses itself in. For the kind of person who loves the kind of anime where a bland guy is surrounded by a bunch of quirky girls, or who love the Mystery Dungeon games, The Guided Fate Paradox is a great, refined example of all of that. For the curious, it’s definitely worth a shot.",

      "How do you think God answers the wishes of us mere mortals? Divine intervention? Direct interaction? Stodgy dungeon crawling? If you answered C: stodgy dungeon crawling, then you’re thinking exactly the same thing as Nippon Ichi Software. The Guided Fate Paradox is a game about a school boy who becomes God and interacts with mortals through the medium of enemy squish-y labyrinth navigation.", 
      "Let’s flesh that out. Renya is a common schoolboy cursed with poor luck and a plain life. No girlfriend, average grades, few friends, Renya is the epitome of mediocre. This vanilla streak ends when, one day while visiting the mall, our hero wins a random sweepstake that sees him cast as God. G-O-D. The almighty. The big man. Renya goes from having no-one and no purpose, to being surrounded by adoring angels while a swath of mortals cry for his intervention.", 
      "Before you worry yourself, however, know that The Guided Fate Paradox isn’t even remotely preachy, or even too religiously reverent. Sure it has angels and devils, and talks about the role of these characters in relation to us common “mortals”, but it doesn’t take long for things to turn mysterious with talk of your character’s failure, a “true” purpose underlying the initial message, and your gaggle of Angel acquaintances being revealed as far less functional than originally advertised.", 
      "The narrative is, however, a touch on the pervy side. As previously alluded to our hero is a smidge vanilla. By that I mean that Renya is the typical anime schoolboy hero: he’s a bit of an introvert, he’s scared by the opposite gender, and when confronted with a quandary he’ll aim to appease anyone and everyone. A great chap to split a pizza with as you’ll likely get the bigger slices, but would you trust him with absolute power? Anyway, his new role of God sees him surrounded by females – some of which are unnervingly predatory – so he reacts with every variation of nervous whimper you’d expect, while the script sees the more “innocent” girls deliver the most painfully obvious innuendos completely plain-faced, forcing Renya into painfully embarrassing situations frequently.", 
      "These moments are fortunately “complemented” by The Guided Fate’s levels, which take the form of questions to you, God. Now, Bruce Almighty might not be one of the smartest films around, nor one of the most memorable, but it did nail one thing – God gets asked a lot of questions. Whereas that film dealt with them via the medium of mass email, The Guided Fate Paradox uses these questions, one at a time, to frame its core gameplay.", 
      "It’s a silly game, then, and in many ways endearingly so if you can accept the occasional sexist dips in the script. What’s unfortunate is that the dungeon crawling feels largely disconnected from the storytelling.", 
      "The concept is that, as God, you can affect a “copy” of the real world to influence the “original” world. In the copy, we see the people that have wished for God’s intervention, but all direct interaction is done via cutscenes. In-between these story scenes, The Guided Fate Paradox becomes a dungeon crawler in which we fight baddies that represent the “real” world trying to fight against the potential change we’re enforcing. There’s no agency in the story telling, and dungeon scenes even look different to story scenes.", 
      "The dungeon crawling is fun, it just feels needlessly separated from the tale being told. Crawling is a case of moving around an isometric map, keeping tabs on energy, health and magic while engaging with foes in a rudimentary turn-based combat scheme. You can even lift and throw enemies and objects, similar to Disgaea D2. Failure isn’t a stopping point, thankfully, as you retain levels gained, but you do lose equipment and money so fainting is best avoided. When death does happen it’s often best to replay old levels to regain some tools and dough, so your main punishment for failure is a bit of a forced grind. The game isn’t repetition heavy if you’re good and prepare before entering Wishes, so after a few failures you’ll likely be far savvier and think about what you’re doing. It’s not Dark Souls, but The Guided Fate Paradox will come down on you, hard, if you start assuming everything is fine.", 
      "The real Paradox, then, is what exactly this game wants to be: visual novel or hardcore dungeon crawler. What’s here is entertaining enough, no need to worry about that, but you’ll enjoy it more once you accept that you’ve got a slightly sleazy schizophrenic on your hands.", 
      "DECENT. A 6/10 indicates that, while this game could be much better, it still has a fair amount to offer the player. It might be an interesting title sabotaged by its own ambition, or a game denied greater praise by some questionable design choices. Don’t avoid it outright, but approach it with caution.",

  "Angband": {
    "http://www.allaboutthegames.co.uk/feature_story.php?article_id=12634": [
      "If you were asked to think of a fantasy RPG that was crushingly difficult, mechanically complex, obsessed with character statistics and utterly merciless when it comes to punishing the slightest mistake, then the chances are you'd immediately name Demon's Souls or Dark Souls. And you'd be right of course - those two games, with a third due to arrive in March of next year, have gained a justified reputation for all of the above. How many other games would celebrate their difficulty with such pride that they ask you to \"Prepare To Die\" before you have even slipped the disc into your machine?", 
      "But what if I told you that there was another game, predating those two by over twenty years which makes them look positively lenient in comparison? You might balk at the idea, but such a game exists.", 
      "Welcome to Angband, a game so sadistic that after two decades there are still players who have yet to conquer it; a game that can bring you out in a cold sweat simply by displaying a capital D on the screen.", 
      "Created in 1990 by Andy Astrand and Alex Custer during their time at the University of Warwick, Angband belongs to the Rogue-like genre of games; a sub-genre of the RPG named after the game that spawned it, these games are best known for random generation, permanent death and presenting their worlds purely in ASCII characters. Oh – and for being very, very difficult.", 
      "The goal of the game is simplicity itself - descend to level 100 of the dungeon and slay the monster Morgoth. That's it. There are no side quests requiring you to fetch 8 sacred pieces of some long-forgotten amulet, no relationships with other characters to be developed, no party to manage and no tracking of morality. There's just your character, a town screen and 100 randomly-generated dungeon levels filled with loot, traps and monsters.", 
      "Beyond that, it’s fairly standard RPG fare - if a game this devious can ever said to be standard. You create a character, choosing gender, race (11 in total, each with their own unique racial traits, starting stats and attribute modifiers), and class. You can then choose to whether to let the game auto-roll your final attribute scores or to allocate them yourself using a basic points-based system. Finally all that’s left to do is choose a name for your hero and off you go.", 
      "Boot it up for the first time and you might scoff at how laughably primitive Angband looks. After all, it's a game that makes the humble Spectrum look like a graphical powerhouse. Modern versions of the game (even after all this time it is still receiving updates, though Astrand and Custer have long since moved on from the project) have a selection of tilesets to choose from but in my opinion they actually detract from the atmosphere. If you want the “pure” Angband experience, then you’ll turn the tilesets off and play the game in all of its original ASCII glory.", 
      "The reason for doing this is simple: this is a game that rewards imagination. Having those tiles representing everything is all well and good, but it’s best, in my opinion, to simply let your mind fill in the blanks. A small 8x8 tile of a mass of white worms will never be as horrific as what your mind can conjure up. It may just be a “w” on the screen, but in your imagination that innocent letter of the alphabet will be transformed into some disgusting, writhing mass covered in ichor and beady black eyes. There may be no sound coming out of your speakers but you’ll swear you can hear every time your foot falls on dank stone and the fluttering of your torch’s flame in the darkness. Playing Angband is like a trip back in time to when the power of imagination was far greater than what a computer was capable of rendering on screen. The irony is that it actually feels more real because of it.", 
      "After getting over the shock of the visuals, the next challenge in front of you is learning how to actually play. Everything you do in the game is performed via keyboard presses and selecting options in menus. Again, this might all sound basic, but Angband is as ruthlessly challenging and mechanically deep as any game you care to mention. Your first clue to how complex this game is will come with your first look at the command list.", 
      "The game utilises 93 basic command inputs, so many that it differentiates between lower and upper case keystrokes. For a large number of those commands, tapping the key will simply open a sub-menu with a further list of options, which will then take you to yet another menu. If you're first starting out in Angband, you'd do well to ensure you have a separate window open to keep track of what every button does (and thankfully there are a number of excellent starter guides available online).", 
      "While a few those commands are for system functions like saving and quitting the game, the vast majority will need to be used if you're to have any hope of descending to the 100th level of the dungeon and slaying the vile Morgoth. Corridors need to be searched for hidden passages, mineral veins and collapsed rubble needs to mined and tunnelled, potions need to be quaffed and traps need to be disarmed (assuming you spot them before it’s too late). There are separate keys for praying, casting magic, learning magic, wearing and taking off armour, throwing items, aiming wands etc. The list is mind-boggling.", 
      "If you're worried about whether or not you'll be able to remember all of those commands in the heat of the moment as you desperately try to escape from whatever alphabetical horror is chasing you down a darkened corridor, then don't be - the one blessed concession granted by the game is that it's entirely turn-based. The world won’t act unless you act first, so no matter how desperate things may seem you can take all the time in the world to consider your next move. That zombie might be mere inches away from sinking its teeth into your neck, but it's still polite enough to wait patiently for you to respond.", 
      "Not that it will make a huge amount of difference, mind. As I said before, the game is tough. At least in Dark Souls, if you die you respawn at the last campfire you rested at, your inventory and skills intact. Angband has no such respect for you. If you die, the game promptly deletes your save and presents you with a crude depiction of a gravestone complete with your character's name, level, how deep into the dungeon they were and how they died. Get used to that screen - you'll be seeing it a lot. And your deaths won't be noble; a sticky end awaits around every corner and is never more than a moment away. You'll die of starvation (characters need to eat in the game, every action gradually sapping their energy reserves), you'll die after being ambushed by monsters while resting (there are no safe areas here), or by casting a spell only to have it backfire and disintegrate you.", 
      "The loot you pick up frequently needs to be identified, but the scrolls required to do so are expensive. If you’re a Wizard and sufficiently high-level then you might have learned how to identify items magically, but casting the spell carries a high mana cost and you never know if there might be a monster just around the corner waiting to take advantage. Of course, you could identify an item by using it, but doing so is risky. That shiny new sword could be cursed, that potion could be poisonous, and that scroll could summon a swarm of monsters from the darkest depths of the dungeon to surround you. Even the loot has it in for you.", 
      "Even in town you're not safe - urchins will sneak up behind you and steal your items, a mercenary might mow you down simply for getting too close and even the village idiot will follow you around trying to drool on you.", 
      "And when you descend the stairs back into the dungeon after a trip to the shops? The dungeon is generated all over again, the passages down so convoluted that it’s impossible to ever return from whence you came (unless you were lucky enough to have used a scroll of Recall to return above-ground).", 
      "Make no mistake, this game hates you with a passion.", 
      "But by God, it's satisfying. After your first, brief, humiliating trips into the darkness below the town, you'll learn to take it slow. Your first attempts at the game are unlikely to last more than an hour if you’re very, very lucky. But gradually you’ll learn to stock up on rations and torches (yes, you always need to ensure you have a light source in order to see the world around you) and you'll realise that often the best way to progress is to retreat; the best way to survive a fight is to never start it in the first place. Slamming a door shut and running away isn't cowardly - it's downright essential and until you learn that you haven't got a hope of even descending to the 5th level, let alone the 100th. Learn those lessons though and the game transforms into one of the most tense, rewarding and satisfying games you'll ever play. There's not many games that can make you let out a genuine sigh of relief simply for surviving after drinking from a bottle.", 
      "It's this sense of incremental progress that will have you coming back again and again and again. You'll die, you'll curse and you'll bang your head against the back of the chair. But then you'll go right back and create a new character because this time you might get a little deeper down, or achieve that next character level. You’ll make daring hit-and-runs on levels deeper than you have any right of being in, simply to try and get some more valuable loot, before escaping back up to a higher level either with a shiny prize or a slither of remaining health. The game is punishing, but the fine balance between risk and reward means that it never feels unfair – every mistake is your mistake, every failure your own. Victory is certainly slim, but it never feels unattainable.", 
      "Few people have ever reached Morgoth. Fewer still have defeated him. I’ve never managed to get further than the 23rd level, after more than a decade of playing and the official forums are filled with similar tales of woe – people who managed to make a character survive for months before late-night exhaustion caused them to make a stupid move or one gamble too many finally saw the game exact its revenge.", 
      "But even now, twenty years later, those players yet to conquer the deepest levels of the dungeon are still staring at that gravestone, still rolling new characters, and still breaking out in a sweat when they see the letter D coming down a corridor created by hash symbols."

The graphics had to be kept within 32 dots x 32 dots, and all the action had to be within those restrictions. However, the DS does not have such restrictions, so players will be able to see many changes. Of course, the technology has advanced a lot in the last 10 years.",

      "Tomie – The very basic premise for SFC Shiren was to make the players play repeatedly. Players will be able to move on with the scenario and will get a bit stronger (stronger equipment, items) every time they play, and progress as they play multiple times. So players of the SFC version may feel that the DS version is easier, due to their familiarity.", 
      "Yamamoto – For example, players of the SFC version may already know the special abilities of the monsters, so they may feel the DS game is easier.", 
      "- In other Mystery Dungeon games, we heard that there are certain restrictions within the title…", 
      "Nagahata – In Shiren, our team members [at Chunsoft] decide the characters and their specs, but other titles have their own set world that we cannot change. So we could say that Shiren is a title where we can fully express what Mystery Dungeon is capable of. In other titles, however, we can pick and choose the good parts of their world, and create a whole new Mystery Dungeon, and that’s definitely fun, too.", 
      "[About Characters and Gameplay]", 
      "It seems that the way Shiren’s party members follow Shiren is a little different…", 
      "Nagahata – In the SFC version, party members wander off unless until everyone reaches the exit room, but this time [in the DS version] they’ll follow as long as they are on the same floor.", 
      "Ishigami – This time, the company will keep following even if you fall into a hole. That doesn’t apply for Surala and Naoki [two non-combatant NPCs that you encounter during bonus scenarios], though… Well, Surala can recover her HP herself.", 
      "Tomie – I thought keeping Surala in your party would be tough, so I proposed it. By the way, Shiren’s company will appear in the ending if Shiren clears the dungeon with them. However that’s really hard, because they don’t level up and in most cases, they get defeated somewhere.", 
      "Yamamoto – In addition, monsters only went after Shiren in the SFC version, but in the DS version, characters like Oryu are also targeted. Pekeji at full-strength mode in the DS version is stronger than in the SFC version, though.", 
      "Nagahata – So then, Kechi might be the most difficult guy to keep alive?", 
      "Tanaka – We really wanted to change that one. They ask for players to give a valuable item, and they give back a Scroll of Need (laugh). In the DS version, they will give back something more useful.", 
      "Tomie – In the SFC version, Pekeji eventually stops appearing if you keep ignoring him… but that would not let players do the Bungee Jump event (laugh). So we changed that part.", 
      "- Are there any other things regarding events that players should know?", 
      "Tanaka – We struggled with the Bungee Jump event. The map generally allows moving sideways, which is different from other maps…", 
      "Yamamoto – We didn’t want to have vertical scrolling during that part…and we really had a tough time coming up with that. (laugh)", 
      "Tanaka – Besides the vertical scroll, the Bungee Jump is a flashy event so we took our time adjusting it. In one of the early versions, a different screen was linked when Pekeji fell… it was hilarious to see Pekeji fall into such a place (laugh).", 
      "Ishigami – In some of the dungeons, we couldn’t add monsters because there was no space to place them.", 
      "Yamamoto – Yeah…that part, the Bungee Jump and battling Kigny King were the parts we had a tough time on, because the programming style is different. In recent Mystery Dungeons there are 2 different programs: there is the one for the main story line with several events in between, and another separate one for the special dungeons. However the SFC version had to handle all of that using just the dungeon program. For example, in the part where the King of the Kigny is defeated and a bunch of townspeople come out, only two npc’s could be generated (laugh).", 
      "[About the Dungeons]", 
      "There are many dungeons after the ending stage (the Golden Condor)…", 
      "Tomie – We’ve always thought that carrying traps would be fun, but it ended up not being as fun as we thought (laugh).", 
      "Nagahata – Absolutely. We thought “that should make the game that much more fun,” but when we tried it, it just wasn’t as good as we imagined (laugh).", 
      "Tomie – Nagahata-san was obsessed with it after the N64 version (laugh).", 
      "- The DS version has additional dungeons, and each of them has a boss.", 
      "Umetani – So that’s why they appear every 10 floors. We did have an idea to have smaller Tainted Insects, though.", 
      "- Was Wi-Fi implementation difficult?", 
      "Ishigami – We first asked Nintendo if we could use our original servers. So the tough part was before the system actually went live. After it went live, it went smoother than we expected. This is probably because of our experience with Shiren for mobile phones.", 
      "- Are there limits to how many times a player can rescue/be rescued…", 
      "Umetani – Players can be rescued 3 times, but the number of times you can attempt a rescue differs depending on the dungeon. It’s determined by the difficulty of the dungeons; fewer attempts are allowed in dungeons where the rescuer is allowed to bring items with them, and more for dungeons where the rescuer cannot, like the Final Puzzle.", 
      "- The rescuers will lose all their belongings if they die during a rescue attempt.", 
      "Nagahata – Yes, they will be gone (laugh). We had that as a concern from the test players and the people who helped us in development. However we had to have the players lose items, because otherwise, players could abuse the Rescue feature to generate items.", 
      "Yamamoto – The rescuers will follow the exact footsteps of the player being rescued, so if the rescuer falls during a rescue, wouldn’t that mean the rescuer is less capable than the person being rescued?(laugh)", 
      "Nagahata – We have a reward system for the rescuers. Players can be rescued by many people via Wi-Fi, but the first one to successfully complete the rescue can also receive items from the person he/she rescued. We would really like to see a lot of communication through this system.", 
      "- Lastly, any message to the fans?", 
      "Yamamoto – There are many changes, so please explore the game.", 
      "Tanaka – Please jump the Bungee Jump. That’s all that I’d like to say. (laugh)", 
      "Tomie – Don’t give up… Something good will eventually happen if you keep at it.", 
      "Umetani – We would like you to check out the very different DS version, so please enjoy.", 
      "Ishigami – Everybody says that we made this game easier, but I don’t think so. Please check for yourself.", 
      "Nagahata – It may not look different at first, but once you get your hands on it, I think you will be able to see the difference. Players of the SFC version will surely like the DS version so please enjoy.",

      "Shiren already has a warm place in some gamers hearts thanks to a fan translation many years ago, but I don't think this fanbase contributed to Sega's decision to localize Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer. What did?", 
      "KD: Chunsoft and Sega have always had a great relationship. However few of Chunsoft’s titles have made it over to the US. Shiren is a solid game and well-adapted to the DS, so it’s a perfect way to test the waters.", 
      "While Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer is based on the Super Famicom game Chunsoft revised the title. What's new in the Nintendo DS version?", 
      "For starters, there’s a huge improvement in the graphics. The DS doesn’t have the severe graphic limitations of the Super Famicom and they’ve taken advantage of it. There is now a fourth type of each monster (as the monsters themselves can level up) with different appearances and abilities. New dungeons have been added, each with their own themes and goals; for example, a dungeon where utilizing traps is the key. In addition we also have a new Nintendo Wi-Fi Rescue system that allows friends to resurrect your character if you fall in battle.", 
      "There are a few really cool items unique to the new dungeons. The Trap Armband will let you pick up and set traps, makes traps work on monsters instead of you, and gives you a snazzy red cloak. Bufu’s Cleaver can instantly carve any monster into Meat. If those make it sound like everything was made easy though, there are also new, gigantic Tainted Insects waiting to gobble you up.", 
      "My favorite new feature is how you can be saved via Nintendo Wi-Fi if you die in a dungeon. Can you elaborate on this? And why did Sega or Chunsoft feel it was a necessary feature?", 
      "The Rescue system is actually really versatile and can also be done using Wireless and with passwords. A defeated player sends a request to another player’s DS. The player who received the request actually fights his way through the dungeons up to the spot where the fallen player is. Then he sends a Revival Spell to the first player’s DS and he can also send one item from his warehouse to help the player out. The revived player can send a thank you note and also send an item. Even if you rescue someone and they don’t say thank you, Hoi the Missionary will give you a reward for your efforts.", 
      "The Rescue system is great because it adds a sense of a community to what otherwise is a single-player game. And of course it offsets the harshness of losing all the items you’re carrying when you die.", 
      "Only the North American and European versions will be compatible (as both are in English). The reason for this is more technical than language-related. Slight differences in the game program made it just too difficult to bridge the gap.", 
      "Is Sega making any tweaks or adding any new features for the US version?", 
      "Fundamentally, the games are designed to be identical though of course there are a few slight changes here and there to accommodate the change from Japanese to English. For a game like Shiren, you don’t really want to try to make the game different from the original. You might lose the flavor.", 
      "Speaking of tweaks the box art gives Shiren a different feel. Maybe it's just me, but I recall Shiren being a carefree character with his happy demeanor on the Super Famicom box and his optimistic smile on the DS box. He looks like a fierce warrior on the US box. Why the change?", 
      "Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer is rife with Japanese culture. Did this make the title difficult to localize?", 
      "There are always at least a few words or situations that are hard to transition to the English version, but the “Japanese-ness” didn’t prove too difficult however.", 
      "Will Sega ever consider localizing the original Super Famicom game and selling it on the Virtual Console? I recall the Japanese equivalent is already up there.", 
      "Currently we don’t have any plans to bring the Super Famicom version to Virtual Console, however we are bringing other classic franchises from that era to Virtual Console.", 
      "The Mystery Dungeon franchise has been very successful and popular with gamers over the years. We truly feel that this title is perfect for the handheld market as it’s a great pick up and play game. The Random Dungeons really lend themselves to a new experience every time, and due to the way the game is designed, players can play for a short period of time and still have a very enjoyable experience. Releasing Shiren on the right platform was definitely a key objective. Finally, we’re getting the word out through sites like yours, where we know your readers include the gamers who love this style of dungeon-crawler/Rogue gameplay.", 
      "What tips would you give to players who never played the original Shiren the Wanderer before?", 
      "Keep in mind that dying and losing items are all part of the game. New items are pretty easy to come by so getting upset about dying is kind of like getting upset about dying in Pac-Man; just roll with it and keep going.", 
      "There are a couple tricks that will help you out in the beginning: you can build up an inventory pretty easily by going through all of Fay’s Puzzles in Canyon Hamlet or even by picking an easy puzzle and going through it several times. For food, the tavern keeper in Canyon Hamlet will give you a Big Riceball every time you enter the town and talk to him. You could build up a supply by entering and leaving town several times and talking to him each time. Also, don’t forget to talk to people, especially if you feel stuck. They’ll either give you advice or help you out when you need it.", 
      "The last question is something I'm burning to know. Is Mystery Dungeon: Shiren the Wanderer the start of a new Sega brand? Will Sega localize Shiren 3 for the Wii?", 
      "It would be great to bring over more of the Shiren games to the US. Of course, we can’t say we have any definite plans at this time but it will be interesting to see how well this first game is received and how loud the call is for more.", 
      "Nice job Spencer. This is the sort of content that you won’t find ANYWHERE else, and that’s why I keep coming back to Siliconera.", 
      "Yeeeeah! GameSpy also had an interview with Keith Dwyer but you, Spencer, asked MUCH better questions (as one who knows the wonders of the MD games)!", 
      "Great interview! I kind of forgot about this game until I read this, but I’m definitely going to get it now. I’m excited about the reviving aspect of the game, but hopefully it doesn’t take the other player too long to find your body.", 
      "i think the second game will be brought a few months before the third game arrive ^^", 
      "So buy this game people, and buy copies for your friends and family! I’ve been playing the Japanese port for over a year so I already know its a GREAT game (even if I didn’t understand any of the sotryline/dialogs), but I assume its going to have to sell pretty good for them to consider bringing Shiren 3 over on the Wii!", 
      "very awesome interview! to anyone from SEGA reading: THANKS!!! Moar Mystery Dungeon o kudasai.", 
      "While some of the guy’s answers are definitely marketdroid speak (like how he ducked questions about the fan translation), there is some heartening stuff here. I’ll probably have to write a column about this….", 
      "Thanks for the positive feedback, I’m glad you guys enjoyed the interview!", 
      "@Lord Gek – I wasn’t aware Gamespy even did a Shiren interview too. Thanks for the heads up. I’m glad Shiren is getting more coverage so it doesn’t slip past people’s attention.", 
      "Rumor has it Nintendo Power’s March ’08 issue (Tales of Symphonia cover) gave it a 6.5 (its too harsh with its death penalty). I have no reason to doubt this but haven’t seen this for myself yet.", 
      "Sorry, this terrible box art does not convey a “new edge” for me.", 
      "Lord Gek: Sounds to me like a classic case of a clueless reviewer. He’s probably never even heard of Nethack.", 
      "@John: I wonder, I plan on reading the review myself today. This is exactly what happened to Torneko: The Last Hope back in 2000. It was torn limb from limb in the reviews with the reviewers finding the game too harsh and simplistic (which, yes, if you didn’t get that this was a roguelike and not a standard RPG they may have had a point)."

      "I call these rules for rhetorical purposes only.  I don't think there are any inviolate laws of game design.  But given we are talking about roguelikes, there are certain properties that have been important to the genre.", 
      "Maybe not to all roguelike games; some of these have to do with designing a good item identification system, for instance, and many of the more recent games do not use that.  I'm fairly outspoken in my appreciation for item-ID systems, so please calibrate your wonk-o-meter appropriately.", 
      "I use the term \"reasonable play\" several times here. It refers to being in a neutral state in terms of danger.  For example, almost any bad effect from using an item can prove fatal if the player uses it at the wrong time.  Discovering the potion of confusion by quaffing when a troll is attacking you is dangerousâso don't do that!",

      "If a game has pre-made levels potential problem situations can simply be made not to ever occur.  In a game that generates situations algorithmically, a lot more care must be given to, generally, the rules of the world, and, specifically, the items and monsters within it, so as to be fair to the player.", 
      "Player fairness, to the uninitiated, might seem to be a laughable thing for roguelikes to worry about.  Is this not the genre that contains Nethack, of that legendary player mortality rate?  But in fact Nethack is an almost ludicrously fair game; the fact that 10+ game winning streaks are possible, covering all the races and roles, proves that.  When you look closely at it, nearly all causes of death come down to player ignorance or carelessness.",

The other two are Baroque, which we'll be looking at shortly (so everyone in the comments can be patient a little while longer) and Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon.",

Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon was a similar kind of thing.  While the Chocobo's Dungeon games have been developed by Square (and later instalments by h.a.n.d.), the first two at least were supervised by the president of Chunsoft, so at least some know-how is behind them.",

      "Roguelikes are the genre of game most associated with randomization of game content.  Some other games, especially classic games, feature substantial random elements, but most of them use them as an afterthought, or in an ineffective manner, or without fully realizing how they change the dynamics of their game.", 
      "As an example I offer a Gamecube game, Nintendo's Pikmin 2.  One of the advertised features for the game of the randomized dungeons that players would enter during play.  I consider that the original Pikmin, which had little or no random elements, to be brilliantly designed.", 
      "It forced players to make wise use of their actions within a strict time limit (30 game days), and yet the limit was short enough that mistakes were duly punished and players had a disincentive to grind for additional troops.  Yet, it wasn't really so difficult that it took players more than one or two attempts to win.  And really dedicated players could win surprisingly quickly; the shortest possible time to win was nine game days out of the thirty allowed.", 
      "But some players, and more importantly game blogs, complained about the overall time limit, so it was removed in the sequel.  Further, for the random dungeons which were advertised as the major addition to the game, the day timer is disabled.  Each floor's layout is not actually randomly generated: instead, the maze layout, the treasures to be found, the resources provided, and the enemy opposition are all static, predetermined for each floor.  Without the timer, there is no pressure that might force players to move on without having found everything.", 
      "The only real randomness is in the locations of all these things.  Scrambling the start location too helps a little, but not much.  Thus, the only effect that the randomness has on the game is the order in which things are found and the relatively small variable tactical challenge that comes from fighting enemies under differing terrain conditions.  For all the promise that randomization maps held, it really barely made any more sense to scramble object locations than to keep them static too.",

      "It is a game, ultimately, about gaining levels and making good use of limited resources, it's quite difficult and yet also has a strong sense of balance, where a decision made half the game ago can suddenly be what pushes you over the edge at the end.  Also, live or die, each game is usually less than thirty minutes, so bad decisions don't drag you down.  If it turns out you can't win, you just retire and try again.  Really good players can tackle one of the challenge dungeons, or even participate in ranked games the scores of which get uploaded to an online scoreboard.", 
      "The game seems to be pretty popular on the gaming blogs right now.  In this interview with South African creator Rodain Joubert, alias \"Nandrew,\" we discuss the game's creation, its great, sudden popularity, its inspiration in Dungeon Crawl, and a little bit about goats and orcs.",

      "Last night, former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was on ABC News to discuss continuing foreign aid as well as his philanthropy work. During the interview, he was asked about Steve Jobs’s less than kind words about him in Walter Isaacson’s bio: specifically, the part where Jobs (unfairly) says that Bill Gates had no original ideas and got rich just by ripping other people off.", 
      "Gates’s response is gracious enough. He says that Steve Jobs and he had a long history with each other, and their relationship as colleagues-turned-competitors was complicated, but that he doesn’t fault Steve for anything he said about him.", 
      "For me, though, the weird part is when Bill Gates says he helped create the original Mac. Maybe Gates doesn’t spend all his time ripping off other people’s ideas, but he sure seems to like ripping off posthumous credit for them.", 
      "Here’s Gate’s full quote on Steve Jobs:", 
      "I like Bill Gates a lot, but this sort of comment isn’t exactly proving Steve wrong.",

      "A lot of the early software available for the Mac came from Microsoft.  In fact, many Office titles originated on the Mac before being ported to Windows.  So, in a sense, Microsoft helped “create” the Mac", 
      "Prior to Windows 95, Windows was nothing like the Mac OS.  The Mac OS at that time was completely different.  Based on software created by IBM, which Apple bought it from.  A lot of the early software available for the Mac DIDN’T come from Microsoft.  Apple built their own “Office” apps, and “Paint” apps.  Which was better than Microsofts current (at the time) software.  Microsoft ripped off the Mac OS to create Windows 95, which is the base of all Windows OS up to this day.  The only contribution that Microsoft put into Apple, is 1. The competition, making Apple “think different”, and creating something Microsoft didn’t have.  And 2. They bought $150 million worth of non-voting Apple shares.  This was to help themselves from going under, and at the same time, also helped Apple from going under too.  But to say that Microsoft helped in building/designing the first Macs is way off base.", 
      "Bill Gates does have a point. If it were up to Steve Jobs alone computers would be purely an upper middle class luxury. Even though there is no doubt in my mind that Apple products provide the best experience, and I am willing to pay for it, I am willing to admit that there is a place for $299 Desktop systems and $329 laptops.", 
      "That place is in the hands of lower income people who live paycheck to paycheck and for whom computing is not a big priority (i.e. reading the news, Facebooking, and checking e-mail, which is probably like 90% of the computer market today).", 
      "Imagine if $1,199 was the cheapest full Desktop system you could buy. There would be a whole lot of people who would not have computers in the house or even more people who would not update as frequently (which would limit software innovation).", 
      "And the $1,199 price tag is only that low because of competitive pressures from lower cost systems. If there was nothing cheaper available, Apple would probably charge a lot more.", 
      "And then there’s Gary Kildall. I’m with Steve Jobs on this one.", 
      "This is an unfairly biased attack at Gates. I love macs, could never see myself going to Windows after so many years but I think to accuse Gates of not working to create macs is unfair. Just check your facts…", 
      "I for one agree with Teds. This is an unfairly biased attack at Gates.", 
      "What else could Gates do? Al Gore already took credit for inventing the Internet. And this does prove that Gates is a genius. He did, after all, wait until Jobs died so he couldn’t call him out on it.", 
      "That’s a rather long winded statement that has nothing to do with fact that he DID NOT help create the Mac. All you are arguing that if it wasn’t for Gates then all computers would be more expensive. Which is a ridiculous argument in of itself since it’s something that you really can’t prove. Just because Gates did it first doesn’t mean that it would have never been done. There are PLENTY of cheap Apple product knockoffs. Just look at anything running Android.", 
      "Well, Gate beat Jobs in this respect: He’s not dead.", 
      "Also, while the code may have been incompatible, many of the “desktop” paradigms were strikingly similar. The Mac was the first to release a successful computer with a graphical user interface on January 24, 1984, and MS released Windows almost a year later on November 20, 1985. They both featured a GUI with “windows” and a “desktop” with “icons”, etc.", 
      "I am pretty sure that they both talk about helping each other out when it comes to mac and windows. they both helped each other, this is the video I believe it was in.", 
      "“Well, Steve, I think there’s more than one way of looking at it.  I think it’s more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it”.", 
      "Don’t feel bad about not knowing these things.  A lot of Apple fanboys tend to base their heart-felt (cult-like) praise for all things Apple (and Jobs) in a skewed version of the truth.  Kinda like Jobs’ “reality distortion field”.  Oh wait…I’m sorry…you might not know what that is.  Read the AUTHORIZED biography and learn about it.", 
      "Bill gates – world best software guru…", 
      "Steve jobs – world best salesman…", 
      "Bill gates was the richest guy in the world for long time and known philanthropist…", 
      "Steve jobs never belong even in top ten richest guy and known ass hole…", 
      "STOP IDOLIZING STEVE JOBS…", 
      "HE WAS AN ARROGANT PRICK…", 
      "NEVER INVENTED ANYTHING, JUST A GREAT SALESMAN…", 
      "I never said Bill Gates was the reason computers can be made cheaply, I just said if all we had was Steve Jobs then computers would be expensive.", 
      "First, Gore really did invent the Internet as we know it today. He carried and won passage for a set of crucial legislation that changed the Internet from a closed system used by government, large corporations, and research universities into something that was commercially viable. One of the main things he changed was the rule against advertising and commercial promotion, originally prohibited on the Internet.", 
      "Gates’ firm did contribute mightly to the Macintosh, particularly in its early days. Apple did not produce an office suite (Macintosh Office was a Lisa, modified to be a MacXL as a server, a laser printer, and the AppleTalk network, not a set of applications). Apple produced MacWrite and MacPaint. MacWrite was fine for most simple things (in those days, command-s was superscript in those days, not save, and one needed Cassidy & Green’s SpellWrite to have spell checking), but Word was necessary for any complex writing task. Word started as an application called Multi-Tool Word for Xenix systems. It was ported to DOS in 1983 to little success and to the Mac in 1984, to great success. Word for Windows doesn’t appear until 1989, well after the Mac Plus was making great strides.", 
      "A MacPlus with a 20 meg, SCSI hard drive, armed with Word and PageMaker, along with a laser printer, was a formidable machine in those days. Nothing in the PC world could touch it. Yes, that system was about five, maybe six, grand, but it was vastly cheaper than the type setting equipment it replaced and made possible low-cost, high-end looking materials in about any office.", 
      "Gates also contributed Excel, a spreadsheet, something Apple greatly lacked. Excel for the Mac appeared in 1985, and the first Windows version doesn’t came out until over two years later in 1987.", 
      "Without the software from Microsoft, the Mac platform would likely not have survived, let alone thrived. While the Mac mainly made strides in nitches, such as publishing, those were nitches kept the platform alive during some very dark days. Frankly, without Word and Excel, I doubt the Mac could have survived with just PageMaker alone, assuming PageMaker would have been writen for the Mac in those circumstances. If Word for Windows had debuted in 1987, that might have killed the Mac platform. We all rather take for granted the amazing abilities of Word, particularly compared with MacWrite. The only real competitor was WriteNow and it has now been lost to history when it wasn’t ported over to the new PowerPC chip set (strange, really, when one considers the owner of WriteNow was originally Jobs). MacWrite couldn’t even handle footnotes originally. Thus, Word was the word processor choice for students, writers, and anyone with serious work to do.", 
      "Thank you, Mr. Gates. I don’t know if you intended to help or did so by accident, but you really did contribute to the Mac in greatly positive way.", 
      "Bill Gates created Windows so you could see the future of technology, but not totally get your hands on it- Steve Jobs put the future of technology in our hands!", 
      "Seems like a poor attack at Gates. While it’s obvious he did not directly contribute to the engineering of the Mac, he was key in the beginning with providing software. It’s clear he just mispoke and wasn’t trying to take credit for anything.", 
      "Bill wasn’t very well prepared for this interview, was he…", 
      "just a perfect answer!", 
      "Too much LSD will do this to you! Don’t try this at home kids.", 
      "Actually Xerox’s PARC design centre came up with the GUI Apple used in Mac OS, not IBM. Apple allowed Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a reduced rate, in exchange for 3 days with the PARC designed computer, which used the first mouse to navigate on a “desktop” and used folders and windows rather than a command line. People believe Apple stole the idea, but they clearly had an arrangement with Xerox, who in fact, dropped the idea of making computers because they believed there was no future in it for them. Microsoft were writing software for the new Mac OS, which they had full access to, and hence lifted chunks of code to develop windows 95, which they didn’t have an agreement for. Seeing as Apple hadn’t patented or licensed the OS, they failed when they sued Microsoft for stealing the OS code. Which is why microsoft will never have an original idea, only copy what others have done.", 
      "Now try to say it without being a total jerk. You’re not completely right either, so don’t sound so self-assured. I’ll let you pick apart your posts for the mistakes, but trust me: they’re there.", 
      "The reality distortion field exists outside of Apple as well…", 
      "Casady (not Cassidy) and Greene… Did the original Word have spell checking?", 
      "Remember, Pagemaker was released before there was really an MS Windows. The version for Windows 2.0 was terrible compared. And crashed a lot! No fonts, no good printers… It was a terrible world, from what I remember.", 
      "Back in 1987, video graphics on PCs were limited to Hercules mono (the best card at the time), or CGA (YUK!) and EGA (not great either). VGA if you had a PS/2. (I forget when Matrox became a player). Pagemaker would not have done well on those at all. Heck, the Commodore 64 with GEOS was almost a better choice than a PC at that time. (That should be a joke…)", 
      "At that time, there was no Excel either. It was MultiPlan (Microsoft’s best revenue generator at the time).", 
      "While I agree that MS may have helped Mac sales, I’m not sure who helped who more. There was no version of Windows that made people want to use it for graphically intensive work at the time, and the PC hardware was a mess of IRQs and bad DOS memory managers, TSRs and drivers. Windows 95 (8 years later) was the first version of Windows to provide real competition for the Mac.", 
      "I wonder what would have happened had Gary Kildall decided not to play golf when IBM came a callin’…", 
      "Two words: Macintosh BASIC. Yes, Bill has a right to say they worked together in creating the Mac.", 
      "See, while the now infamous quote from Gates, about how he went to steal a neighbours (Xerox) TV only to find that Jobs got there first, is true because (and no one knows if Microsoft did visit Xerox and see the Alto in action) graphical interfaces were viewed as the future of computing, it’s undeniable that it was upon seeing the Mac while Microsoft battled ahead with the vastly inferior DOS, that Gates decided he wanted his own version of what was on the Mac.", 
      "The Alto didn’t inspire both Jobs and Gates, it inspired Jobs first and Mac OS was born. It was then that Mac OS “inspired” Gates, who went on to rip it off while working on software for the Mac. Also, people from that era will remember that while Windows copied Mac OS, it was inferior in it’s presentation, lacking the graphical prowess (overlapping windows, etc) found in Mac OS.", 
      "As for co-creating the Mac itself? Bullshit, Bill … and he knows it.", 
      "My heart is shaped like an Apple, and have some different opinions about Mr. Gates. But I got to hand it to him, he took it like a man and I respect him for it.", 
      "Gates could have decided to be rude or angry but instead he remained calm and relaxed.  I have gained more respect for Gates because he clearly chose to speak positively about Jobs; his composure and positivity tell a lot about Gates’ character.", 
      "Either his handlers suck, or he doesn’t use any, because he never seems very prepared. He likes to talk about his philanthropic efforts now and everyone always wants to talk to him about Microsoft and many times get gets visibly annoyed by it.", 
      "Nonsense Mr Gates. You are not able to claim a philosophy or attitude in systems design, meaning innovation! It is similar to a successful innovation vehicle such as BMW where the tire manufacturer are also only a ‘supplier’. Remember also that Gates & Co purchased ‘DOS’ from Nixdorf Computer AG, Germany. Gates further developed and only IBM brought ‘DOS’ to world wide success. remember?", 
      "Yes, Steve had Bill help him out in the early days of Apple. It’s weird that you don’t know that… being a Mac enthusiast blogger", 
      "How was I being a jerk? I was merely pointing out where his version of reality was distorted. And yes, while I may not be COMPLETELY right ( I didn’t bother to cite contracts or give explicit details like you did) the gist of what I wrote was correct.  Let’s pick it apart (as you suggested):", 
      "“The OS was based on software created by XEROX”", 
      "This is a factual statement.  Is it not?", 
      "“Microsoft’s office based apps (specifically Excel) were superior to Apple’s, especially in the early days (Apple’s were shit)”.", 
      "Ok…this could probably be argued as being personal opinion. There are folks out there (Apple fanboys) who feel nothing produced by Jobs and company could ever be shit. It should be noted, however, that God…er…Jobs was enamored with Excel (straight from Isaacson’s book) as it was certainly more robust than the spreadsheet module included with AppleWorks for the Apple II (so much so they didn’t bother porting it to the Macintosh until much later).  In addition, although MacWrite was ok, it was not as good as Word (not by opinion…by the numbers).", 
      "“Um….no. They both ripped off Xerox”", 
      "I made this statement in reference to the fact the original “idea” for a GUI interface came as a result of what Jobs and Gates saw at Xerox. Sure, Apple licensed the “idea” from Xerox (Microsoft subsequently licensed it from Apple for Windows) but when Apple faithful distort reality and believe Apple invented it, I say no.  They extend this distortion by saying Microsoft lifted chunks of Apple code to create Windows 95.  Maybe so.  The courts, however, did not agree.  To be clear, both Microsoft and Apple have been guilty of ripping each other off through the years.", 
      "“Um…no. Microsoft was nowhere near going under”", 
      "They weren’t.", 
      "Is the gist of all this not correct? Please point out where I’ve made a mistake.", 
      "OK, just to make sure I understand the folks agreeing that Bill co-created the Mac with Steve… if I write an app for the iPhone, do I get to say “Steve and I worked together, creating the iPhone”???", 
      "“How was I being a jerk?” By inserting snide comments that dismiss your detractors as the “Apple fanboys”, the followers of “God…er…Jobs” or the “Apple faithful”.", 
      "“‘The OS was based on software created by Xerox’ This is a factual statement. Is it not?” Not entirely. As you admit further down, both Mac OS and Windows were inspired by Xerox. Saying they were based off of it (to me) implies a common code base, which is certainly not the case.", 
      "Yes, your statement about Apple software being “shit” early on is completely objective. I have no loyalty to Jobs or Apple other than what they have earned. But one could make the argument that Word, Excel and other MS Office programs’ success was directly proportional to the success of the OS as a whole. Or not. There are any number of arguments that can be made once objectivity is thrown out – which is why objectivity SHOULDN’T be thrown out.", 
      "“Um…no. They both ripped off Xerox.” Again, this implies foul play by Apple and MS, which wasn’t the case. It may not have been an idea that originated at Apple, but it was all above board. And if I may be allowed a colloquialism, Audre Lorde once said, “There are no new ideas. There are only new ways of making them felt.” Xerox didn’t have the original idea either – everyone is inspired by something. The original mouse was pioneered by Doug Englebert in the 1960s, and the original GUI by Ivan Sutherland (also in the early 1960s). These men in turn were inspired by others with “original” ideas.", 
      "“Um…no. Microsoft was nowhere near going under”. No, they weren’t. You were quite right.", 
      "Mistakes are relative, as are truths. Your mistake was in being so absolute that you painted yourself into a corner.", 
      "sir1jaguar…", 
      "Likes to use a lot of periods…", 
      "After each statement…", 
      "Not really sure why…", 
      "Guess he likes them a lot…", 
      "Ah, yes, Casady & Greene. They were a wonderful company back in the day. They had a spreadsheet program, fonts, games, you name it. They were so inventive and creative. I really miss them. I don’t know if the Multi-Tool Word version had a spell check, but the first Macintosh version did. For its day, Word was surprisingly sophisticated.", 
      "I agree PageMaker really didn’t have any choice but the Mac platform, given its visual representation of a page (the most radical use of WYSIWYG at the time). I can still remember discovering Times was substituted for New York when something printed and all the trouble that caused me until I figured it out (yes, that substitution was clearly noted in the documentation). Still, I could do things with PageMaker that were noithing short of remarkable.", 
      "Still, I am not sure PageMaker alone could have saved the Mac. Even then, PageMaker imported text and most things were written in Word at the professional level. If anything, Word spured on MacWrite and WriteNow. Excel for Mac comes out in September of 1987 and was a big hit from the start. With PageMaker and Excel only really available on the Mac in 1987, 88, and most of 89 (Excel for Windows comes out in December of 89), I think the Microsoft products gave the Mac a big advantage back in those days. Keeping them available on the Mac back in the Dark Days of the early 90s I think saved the platform and the company.", 
      "Thus, I think Gates can legitimately claim he “did key software” for the Mac and those products did help in very positive ways create the Mac as we know it today.", 
      "If you write an app that turns the iPhone from an interesting curiosity into a viable platform, an app so useful and widespread it helps define the platform, and then, when the iPhone is having trouble competing, you keep producing great updates for the iPhone so the Apple can fix the problems, then, yes, I think you helped co-create. Fortunately, the iPhone didn’t need that and it didn’t happen.", 
      "I think we can say VisaCalc helped create the Apple II.", 
      "I think your point is that Visicalc is one of the applications that helped make the Mac popular and successful, and that allows Visicalc’s developer to claim the title of creator of the Mac. Wow, that opens a whole new world to me as a “creator”.", 
      "But why stop with “hey I wrote an app for the thing you made, so that makes me a creator of the thing you made”? For example, what really made the Macintosh a success was all of the users who bought and used one. I was one of those people. Ergo, I am also a creator of the Mac…!!?? And I didn’t even use Visicalc.", 
      "“By inserting snide comments that dismiss your detractors as the “Apple fanboys”, the followers of “God…er…Jobs” or the “Apple faithful”.”", 
      "I see nothing snide about those comments nor the context in which I made them.  In fact, I was being quite direct about what I feel accurately describes a person who can blindly dispense with the truth and state things as fact, with little or no research.  Is this not what “fanboys” do?  Is this not what Eric27 did? Take a look at some of the other comments here.  Have any trouble discerning who’s who?", 
      "And no…I don’t dismiss all detractors as “Apple fanboys”.  You’re kind of a detractor. I don’t consider you a fanboy (despite your avatar and username).  Why?  Because you’ve obviously done your homework.", 
      "“Saying they were based off of it (to me) implies a common code base, which is certainly not the case.”", 
      "Oh come on…you’re reaching here.  You know damn well I wasn’t trying to imply they were from a common code base.  Geez…the thought never even entered my mind.  I was simply pointing out to Eric27 it was Xerox (not IBM) he should have been referring to.  You inferred incorrectly here, sir.", 
      "“Yes, your statement about Apple software being “shit” early on is completely objective.”", 
      "Never felt cornered.  Always felt as though I was in the middle of the ring, going toe to toe.", 
      "Umm, my point is either Word & Excel helped make the Mac platform, or Visicalc made the Apple II platform. As far as i know, Visicalc was never released for the Mac platform.", 
      "Do I think the definition of “create” is expansive enough to include those not on the Mac128 development team, yes. Do I think users had much to do with the creating the Mac. Yes, I would argue we did, but our individual contributions are hard to trace.", 
      "The contributions of Bill Gates are relatively obvious, as are those of Jeremy Jaech, Mark Sundstrom, Mike Templeman, Dave Walter, and Paul Brainerd (the PageMaker team); Spec Bowers, Alan Albert, Dan Chadwick, Jega Arulpragasam (from Wang, who are the core who gave us FileMaker);  John Warnock and Charles Geschke (who gave us PostScript);  Gary Starkweather (who gave us the laser printer);  Hartmut Esslinger,  Andreas Haug, and Georg Spreng (founders of Frog Design, who, along with Steve, made great industrial design a part of Apple all the way back to the Apple IIc);  David Bunnell and Andrew Fluegelman (who gave us MacWorld); and, of course, Steve Jobs.", 
      "Jobs didn’t invent them Mac on his own, nor was it solely his vision. There was a whole team at Apple that made the Mac. Does anyone want to write Jobs contributed more than  Jef Raskin (who was working on the Mac well before Jobs was), Bill Atkinson, Burrell Smith, Andy Hertzfeld, Guy Kawasaki, or Bud Tribble?", 
      "If Jaech said he’d help create the Mac with his PageMaker software, would anyone challenge him? If Starkweather claimed the laser printer helped create the Mac, who would disagree?", 
      "Touché. Well reasoned and (mostly) snark-free.", 
      "I’m definitely not a fanboy (my name AND avatar are actually intended to promote my stance on platform agnosticism – “mac ” and “google” combined).", 
      "It was a reach to claim you were implying a common codebase, although that was my initial impression when I first read your comment.", 
      "Oho, a bit of snark there – you can call him whatever you want. Mr. Jobs, Steve-O or borderline sociopathic nut-job. You’re not going to offend me, as long as you can back up why you label him that.", 
      "My point was not that they invented it, but that no one can truly claim to be the author of a completely original idea – all are based off of inspiration and precedent. Fanboys DO cut a lot of corners and say he “invented” the mouse, the GUI, etc when it would be more accurate to say he refined these paradigms to where they were accessible and then popularized them.", 
      "Again, touché. Your corner might not be as inescapable as I first thought. We don’t disagree near as much as either of us initially thought. Cheers!", 
      "I respect your position. I just disagree with it. Not necessarily any of the individual points, but rather the whole of your argument that the Mac (or the Apple II, or the iPhone, or Windows, or MSDOS, or the Zune) was “created” by anyone who happened to write a successful application for the platform. My example of how I helped create the Mac because I owned one was sarcasm (I also owned an Apple II, so my list of contributions to the computing world is expanding during our back and forth).", 
      "As for the team that did create the original Mac, Kudos! I still have  the old mac with everyone’s signature molded into the case. Yes, these endeavors are almost always the work of more than one person. And even when it’s mostly just one person, that person is standing the shoulders of giants. When I look at the amazing technology we hold in our hands, I don’t look at it as the achievement of just one person, or one company, or even one industry. It’s culmination of what started with some guy in a cave who thought fire was pretty nifty.", 
      "But to try and twist all that to say that Bill is the creator of the Mac is just plain silly. IMHO.", 
      "I absolutely agree we stand on the shoulders of giants and  the technology available today is nothing short of amazing. I am old enough to have used punch cards and was dizzy with joy for getting access to a computer with them, so all that I have now makes me feel like I live in a sci-fi adventure novel sometimes. Fire is a rather nifty thing.", 
      "I don’t think Bill created the Mac, but was a significant contributor to it. I think he had more programers writing more good stuff for the Mac almost anyone save Apple.", 
      "You know the old saying, victory has many parents, while failure is an orphan. The Mac has been triumphant, converting essentially everyone to GUI, even its opponents. I give Steve the most credit, but I say Uncle Bill put in a pixel or two.", 
      "Well said, and we end this discussion in agreement :)", 
      "My original (and only) beef was with the comments that seemed too eager to grant co-creator status to Bill. It just seemed to lower the bar a bit too much – not unlike how nowadays they give trophies to every kid on every team. I remember in my day, we used to… OK, I’ll save that for another thread.", 
      "Casady & Greene was a nice little company… Good people, and great software. Strange that it was in Salinas (well, close) and not in Silicon Valley. Then again, Digital research was in Monterey.", 
      "I wish there was an iPad port of Mission Thunderbolt. (Calhoun, you listening?)", 
      "Seems I got some dates wrong regarding Excel. It was ’85 when it was released for Mac. I thought it was later.", 
      "I agree, PM was not enough to save Apple, and MS continuing to make Word and Excel for Mac was certainly helpful. That price issue was always the real killer. $5000+ for a Mac, vs $999 for a basic PC, and about $2500 for a good one. The Mac was a great machine, but most could not justify the cost. And the accessories… Windows added to a PC was a no-brainer, and I’m sure most copies of Windows 3.1 were pirated :-)", 
      "Nobody can deny that BG and MS made great software for the first Mac. He and his company had the experience, and they had worked with Apple to create Apple II Basic (Woz just wouldn’t do floating point…??), so having them create the first Mac software was a natural choice. Whether it can be said that he helped “create” the Mac… That’s debatable.", 
      "My god.", 
      "Mmm… reading “Steve Jobs” by Walter Isaacson I found the following quote referring to Bil Gates:", 
      "“We did the Mac together” Jobs said. “How did that work for you? Very well. Now we’re going to do this together and this is going to be great.”", 
      "This was in reference to Steve Jobs pitching Bill Gates to get involved with his new company NeXT.",

      "The game's interface was designed for touch screens but isn't perfect: it's too easy to order your hero to move when you're trying to select your portrait, and to change your aim with a ranged attack when you're trying to confirm it. Also, until you figure out that you nearly always want to tap a destination rather than holding down on the direction you want to go, you'll die many a pointless death and fall off every time you try to ascend a ladder.", 
      "All this makes the game really easy to put down and pick back up again, assuming you can bear to put it down. Right now, Emma the Frosty, my 11th level White Witch, is busy confounding a Roman Legion into fighting itself (and feeding their corpses to her pet wolf). She's invisible, regenerates mana like a mofo, and is rocking a turban with her +2 blessed Japanese Robe, courtesy of a Jinni and a Tengu respectively.", 
      "\"moble-friendly\"??", 
      "Up until this review, i had no intentions of buying this. It just looked amateurish. This review may have talked me into picking this up.", 
      "I always thought Brogue had a quite lot of frills compared to classic roguelikes. How many ASCII games can you name with animated liquids?", 
      "The review mentioned Brogue as being a \"no-frills\" roguelike, but in comparison to a traditional ASCII roguelike it's been modernized and frilled-up considerably to make it more accessible.", 
      "I love this game. Its absolutely compulsive playing !", 
      "This game is the best $2 spent on iOS so far!  I rec this game to all my iOS friends, no hesitation.", 
      "Personally I found the art style so distracting that I quit playing the game.  It seems like an attempt at a more cartoonish style but there isn't an underlying style to the artwork. IMHO it lacks the charm and whimsy that exemplifies great artwork.", 
      "It's really just Rogue turned on its edge, sort of like Terraria compared with Minecraft.", 
      "No disrespect to your point of view but to offer a different take i personally find the art utterly charming.", 
      "Agreed. Art couldn't be more ugly", 
      "Love the art.", 
      "Some of us come from the days of the ZX spectrum.", 
      "You guys don't know ugly...;)", 
      "My first console was the ColecoVision, and I think this game is pretty ugly. But it's also a lot of fun too.  It's a bit sad because you can tell someone spent a lot of time on modeling and everything, but the art just didn't get there.", 
      "I agree that the art is not very appealing; when I first saw screenshots of this game, I was initially put off by its appearance. However, once I started playing it (I downloaded it because what the heck, it's free!), I found the gameplay absolutely enthralling! To anyone who doesn't want to try it because of the visual style I say give it a shot! It's truly a great game!", 
      "Pretty tasteless art, I agree. There are ways to do ugly right (Dragonslasher, Morrowind, Another World) but the theme here is off putting. I'll give another shot, maybe it will grow on me.", 
      "Terraria has a wonderful art style on that note.", 
      "Warwick has been doing amazing things for a long time.", 
      "I found the touch controls ruined the game for me. To many deaths from the character going the wrong way. Controls killed this game for me. Had to delete.", 
      "Yeah, I'm in a similar boat. I love all things roguelike, but the last time I tried this game it felt supremely... 'slippery'. Got frustrating fast.", 
      "Also, I have an iphone5 and NO problems running high-end 3D stuff, yet this game plays like a pig. Hiccups every time (I assume) it loads a new area in, see: OFTEN.", 
      "This game is awful", 
      "I'm on an IPhone 4, and the controls and graphics are great. I've never had a problem telling my character what to do, and am always amazed at the new options available. 4.5 stars is an appropriate rating. It is amazingly easy to pick up and just as difficult to master.", 
      "The art style heavily reminds me of Swordigo (iOS game)... Which I really hate. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved Swordigo (beat the entire game) but the art is very off putting. The art style they're going for in this game looks very amateurish/unprofessional. No, I'm not a graphics hose, but the art style has to look somewhat appealing to me for me to buy it.", 
      "I think this game is excellent. I have spent more hours playing this than any other IOS game.  In fact, this is my favorite roguelike ever.", 
      "I love the humour in this game!", 
      "Good GOD this game is choppy. I turned on the FPS counter out of curiosity and wasn't too surprised to see I was getting around 2 to 5 FPS.", 
      "5th gen iPod users need not apply...", 
      "Not choppy on iphone 4.  Strange, I thought your iPod 5 had better stats?", 
      "Oh... It does, but the choppiness doesn't lie. Don't knock me down one point until you've tried it on a 5G yourself.", 
      "I've got a 5th gen 32 GB iPod Touch with 7 GB space free and no visible performance hit here.", 
      "I'm not a huge fan of the graphics and art style, but the game itself is great. It is very accessible in the sense of being easy to play on a mobile device, and to pick up and play for a few minutes at a time, but not in the sense of being easy or shallow.", 
      "My only complaint so far is that the dev goes a little *too* far with the idea of withholding information to let the player figure it out. I'm fine with that for items and monsters and stuff - not learning about new parts of the game until the first time they kill you is half the fun of roguelikes, isn't it? - but the game doesn't ever seem to tell you basic things like how much different items weigh or what each primary stat does, which means you either wiki that stuff early on or accept that you don't really know what is going on and can't make informed decisions about the few things you can control, like initial stats.", 
      "At least now I know I'm not the only one who's desperately chugged pots only to have myself set on fire.", 
      "Whether the art is great or awful, it's easy to tell a \"d\" from a \"D\" this way heh.", 
      "I really enjoy this game, though I'm not getting too far.", 
      "Love this game, spot on review TA.", 
      "This game has wonderful mechanics but the art style and movement system is a horrible joke which cripples the game. I only bought it off the back of its review on here - which proves once again that TA are getting tired of reviewing games and really the stars mean sweet f all these days. I am on the verge of deleting ta because of all these embarassing reviews you are putting put for average at best games, some blatant copy and pastes, leading me to believe you are financially sponsored by gaming companies.",

      "Roguelikes are definitely a niche genre. There’s those who grew up on them and have been playing them for years, and those who have never heard of the term. But recently there has been a growing number of Roguelikes that have been made with the idea of introducing modern gamers to the genre.", 
      "For those who aren’t familiar with Roguelikes, here’s a bit of a rundown. Roguelikes are generally turn-based games with a large focus on replayability and intricate gameplay. They tend to be role-playing oriented, giving the player a character that they create and explore the world presented to them. Roguelikes tend to be very challenging and feature a permanent death system; if your character dies it’s game over. The focus on turn-based play makes them more strategic than reflex based, winning is about how you build your character and the choices you make, rather than how fast you can hit a button.", 
      "Games such as Dungeons of Dredmor provide a relatively easy step into the world of Roguelikes with a more graphical approach than is traditional in the genre. In the past Roguelikes have generally been text or ASCII graphics based, using simple letters and symbols to represent the player, monsters and the dungeons. But there has been an influx of newer games that have started implementing everything from simple tiles to full graphics in order to present a more modern face to the genre.", 
      "WazHack by Warwick “Waz” Allison, a 42-year-old “beardy old hacker” in Brisbane, Australia, is the newest entry on that list. Waz has been writing computer games since he was 12. He created Troglodyte for the Atari back in 1988.", 
      "“[WazHack] is most heavily inspired by NetHack,” said Waz, “which I worked on in the past. I created the original “tile” graphics for it years ago.” The inspiration is clear when presented with the countless references from the classic game.", 
      "WazHack presents a new twist on the standard “top down” view that most Roguelikes use. Instead of the traditional bird’s eye view that players have, WazHack gives you a side view of the game. In essentially a side-scrolling style the player will travel down through the dungeon in an attempt to find the Amulet of Zaw, a mystical artefact – and a classic objective in Roguelikes; finding the uber doo-dad of power to win.", 
      "The game is also fully graphical. The player sees their character exploring and the game shows all equipment changes they go through. Enemies are well detailed and minor details in a monster can show the player the difference between variants of a type. The sewer rat that is of little concern stands out from the plague rat that can cause you great trouble. The graphical style has more appeal to modern gamers who aren’t used to text-based games.", 
      "The game is currently in the Beta4 phase but a new version should be released soon. While the game is a little bare bones at the moment there are a lot of features Waz intends to implement.", 
      "“High on my list are side-branching dungeon areas and special levels,” said Waz. “These add variety to the scenery and of course they will come with their own unique fauna.”", 
      "The game currently sports over 100 different monsters and over 250 items to be found and used. For every item Waz has to create a new in game graphic, so that’s a great undertaking. As is standard with Roguelikes, the dungeon and what you encounter is randomly generated. So every adventure is a unique experience. While there is a general progression to monsters and loot as you explore there is a great deal of randomness that will help shape your journey. Finding a powerful weapon early on or a useful spell might drastically improve your chances of survival; of course that water nymph that runs off with your armour might change them just as much.", 
      "“I’m developing a very unusual form of co-op play,” said Waz. “I can’t say more yet because the design is not complete. I love co-op gaming so this feature has been planned from the start, but it will need a lot more testing help and input from the player community than the single-player game.”", 
      "There will be two styles of multiplayer, co-op and competitive. In the co-op mode, players will both run through copies of the same dungeon and will automatically share information with each other in regards to identified items as well as being able to communicate to warn each other of dangers they each face. There will also be a trading system in place so that they can share items between each other to help each other out. Having the warrior player pass spell books over to the wizard player while receiving armour in return would definitely help with survivability. In the competitive mode, these features will be disabled and it will be more of a contest of which player can outdo the other.", 
      "As the game is turn-based, lag and latency shouldn’t be a problem. If one player is dying they can wait for the other to explore ahead so as not to put them at more risk. Or if one player is having problems with a monster the other could drop off some healing items to help them out. All this is a wonderful new approach to Roguelikes, which have always been single player affairs.", 
      "“Yes, it’s weird,” said Waz. “But it’s great fun, and feels a lot like other co-op games, while definitely being true Roguelike.”", 
      "Reliance on the community is often a key factor in the development of Roguelike games. As with most independent developers their design isn’t a matter of a marketing department telling them what the players should enjoy. It is usually an open dialogue with the players to receive their input on what’s desired, what works and what doesn’t.", 
      "There are various ways that Waz checks on player feedback. The direct emails, posts on the Reddit page and thousands of game results are key sources of information. But the wishing system in game is also something that lets Waz see what they players are demanding. “There are times in the game when the player may wish for something,” said Waz. “If the wish cannot be granted, it is added to a database that other players can then vote on. In the Talent system of Beta4, almost all Talents are answers to wishes. For example, some players thought that there was not enough food, so now those players can choose to pursue the Anatomy talent which gives them more meat from creatures they slay.”", 
      "Seeing this level of dedication to the players is one of the things that get independent developers so much praise. It’s also one of the reasons there are countless Roguelikes out there. No matter what it is you’re seeking, there’s bound to be something out there to your tastes.", 
      "Currently the game has a two-dollar registration fee. This small fee allows you to actually complete the game, though you can still play down to 800 feet down in the dungeon before that point. When the game is “released” Waz intends to make it a five dollar cost, available on Steam and Desura, so early registrations will save you a little money. However the game will not be “finished” for some time as Waz will continue to add content even after the game is fully released. The release version will be a standalone program however, the current web based form is being used for the ease of development and ensuring the players can test the latest version.", 
      "WazHack is a great Roguelike game that lives up the standards of the classics but still presents a more modern face to players. Whether you’re a Roguelike guru or new to the genre this is one game that’s definitely worth taking a look at."

He does so by entering the Circuit and going into the Copy World, a dungeon that’s a copy of the Original World, stripped down to the bare essentials relating to the wish. By defeating aberrations, manifestations of mental obstacles keeping the wisher from changing their own fate, that appear in the randomly generated dungeons, Renya is able to fulfill his duty as God and grant the desire of those who have prayed to him.",

      "After constant use, equipment will “burst,” causing a slight decrease in strength while granting you Holy Icons (more on those in a minute). You can reset the “burst” status on your equipment by upgrading it at the blacksmith, which also gives you more time to use the equipment before it “bursts” again.", 
      "Whenever you die in one of the game’s many unique and diverse dungeons, not only do you lose all of your equipment and everything in your item pouch, but the level you were inside of resets. Still, leveling up is essential as even though you’re level one each time you enter a dungeon, the levels you gained are added to your Total Level, which are your base stats (eventually you can trade in levels from your Total Level for rare items).", 
      "Holy Artifacts, meanwhile, grant you special skills and abilities. The downside is that they have to be placed on top of Icons, thus negating their effects.

      "Our story opens up with the world being held hostage by the nefarious Darkdeath Evilman. Living up to his name, Evilman has kidnapped the Super Baby, a newborn messiah who has the potential to save the world. The only person who can save the Super Baby is the Absolute Victory Unlosing Ranger, a legendary masked warrior with amazing strength. Unfortunately, the Unlosing Ranger is hit by a car on his way to the battle. With his last breath, he gifts his magic transformation belt to a nearby pedestrian and tells him to take over as the Unlosing Ranger. The poor bystander is promptly slaughtered by the unfathomable power of Darkdeath Evilman. Surprisingly, he is rescued at the last moment by a girl called Etranger and offered the chance to train as a hero on a monster-filled Bizzaro Earth. If he can solve the problems of Bizzaro Earth, he'll restore the faith of the people on Earth and gain the power to save the Super Baby. If he fails, Super Baby and the world are doomed. No pressure, right?", 
      "Each level boss has a trick that must figure out to most effectively damage him. One boss hides inside a giant submarine, and the only way to damage him is to figure out where he's going to attack and throw his explosive torpedo back at him before it detonates in your face. Another boss is hidden behind an impenetrable barrier, and the only way to damage it is to complete a puzzle while fending off a swarm of constantly replicating monsters. Most levels have a ton of supplies for you to use, and the bosses have pretty simple patterns. It's a matter of keeping up your health and hunger to outlast the boss. It's nice to have boss fights that are interesting and memorable, as opposed to a sack of hit points that you must beat into submission.", 
      "But what about all those items that you've lost? The game also has mechanics in place for that. You can convert your weapons and armor into more permanent boosts. By visiting the local mad scientist, you can have your items converted into chips that are implanted into your body. This is done by placing the chips into a grid diagram of your body. Each chip gives a boost to one of your stats, and the more chips you add, the greater the boost. Once you place chips, you can also place boosters over those chips for additional passive bonuses, like increase your inventory capacity, earn extra experience, keep certain items when you die, or even survive a fatal blow. The placement of the chips and boosters also impacts their effectiveness. The boosters closest to your Hero Energy Generators will have dramatically increased effects. Smart placement of boosters can turn you into quite the juggernaut, while poor placement can make things frustrating.", 
      "In addition to being able to customize yourself, you can also customize your home base. You begin the game with a few basic buildings, such as a blacksmith and your home. These buildings grant benefits both in and out of dungeons. For example, your home includes your wife (a guest-starring Prinny from the Disgaea series), who will ask for money for expenses. Giving her cash will lead to increased storage space. You can summon your \"wife\" once per dungeon to bring you a homemade lunch, which is a great boost if you're low on EN. As the game progresses, you'll unlock more locations. My favorite is the insurance building, which lets you pay a premium to insure your dungeon dives; the more you pay, the better your insurance will be and the more items will be covered. The catch is that you can only have a set amount of buildings. You have to decide which ones are most useful and which ones you can do without. You can switch buildings easily, but you might regret putting the blacksmith into storage when you're trapped 20 levels deep in a dungeon and your best weapon is about to break.",

    "http://www.siliconera.com/2013/04/18/nippon-ichi-software-ceo-sohei-niikawa-reflects-upon-past-mistakes/": [
      "Due to the negative income Nippon Ichi Software saw in 2009, they had to resort in halting developments for several titles that didn’t meet quality standards, and several games were never released for that reason.", 
      "Well, Good luck NIS!", 
      "I think the japanese game industry lost its ‘can do’ spirit, that’s why we see so much drama.", 
      "Personally I feel like much of the game industry has forgotten that they are making a product, and that pleasing the consumer of the product should be paramount if you want to stay in business. There seems to be an unhealthy amount of not even obliviousness, but outright disdain for the customer amongst the game industry these days…", 
      "I think NIS is heading that way too. Probably why they are making a part 2 to the most popular disgaea. I will admit Disgaea 1 was my favorite, as only one character has had as much charm as the cast of part 1 in the ones that followed, and that was Desco. Tuna vampire and werewolf weren’t bad, but just didn’t quite measure up to the quality of the original Disgaea cast.", 
      "They really seem to be focusing more on making their games accessible now, which works for me. D2 is WAY more friendly than previous Disgaea games, especially after the ship parts debacle in D4, and a cursory glance at the trophy list for the Vita port of D3 indicates a much more friendly approach as well; gone are the tedious pirate trophies, thank the maker.", 
      "Add to this the cheat shop in D2 instead of tedious bill passing as well as adding the bribe option to passing bills instead of the tedious ‘Use Force’ option and you’ve got a much improved experience. Honestly I think D2 is the most enjoyable Disgaea I’ve played as a result of all the changes they made to how the game fundamentally plays.", 
      "I don’t mind them making disgaea a little more accessible, but doing away with the senate isn’t hte way to to that. This game hits home about demon negotiations and the way to get your things to go through without a hitch is to beat up the senate. I always enjoyed that, and the senators themselves were easy enough since they never had any gear to pump up their defense or attack.", 
      "They haven’t done away with it, it’s still there. They’ve just made it a hell of a lot easier to pass bills. Personally I hated having to use force all the time because it got really boring really quickly. Though since the cheat shop replaces a lot of bills now anyway you’ll be passing fewer bills in the senate in any case.", 
      "The only bill I didn’t enjoy, well bills, was monster power up and down. Other than those, I had 0 issues with the senate. I would rather be able to choose how much monster power goes up and have a less likely yes vote the higher I go than have to redo it 8 times to maximize monster difficulty.", 
      "But over all, I haven’t been paying attention to that part of the discussion on the new game and I barely remember Disgaea 2. That was the only Disgaea I never finished because it bored me.", 
      "Monster bills are gone now, they’re in the cheat shop. You can just increase or decrease monster level at will, it’s glorious. Exp boosts and other things are there too so you don’t need to spend as much time looking for exp innocents and the like.", 
      "You can tell too that this really soured their relationship with Hit Maker. You can sorta tell after Last Rebellion and A Witch’s Tale failed, there’s a distinctive lack of anything Hit Maker.", 
      "I wonder, actually, if they’re still making games now? Does anyone know what their latest release was?", 
      "I wasn’t talking about NIS, I was talking about Hit Maker, haha.", 
      "And I know all about NIS releases! I have Guided Fate Paradox and Disgaea D2 on pre-order along with Witch, and I own Disgaea 4 and Legasista.", 
      "I checked there, but the list feels outdated, since they mention that, at the time, they were working on Last Rebellion. Not exactly very current!", 
      "Reading from both of those lists, yeah, I’m not surprised at all that NISA may have decided to kick those guys to the curb…", 
      "Yeaaah, something tells me after Last Rebellion failed, they probably don’t really have the money to do anything else. And Last Rebellion was probably done with NIS’s assistance in terms of funding, too.", 
      "Just went to their website looks like they’re making stuff for ios I think they ported a Witch’s Tale to it.", 
      "I think Dennou Senki Virtual-On Force was their last…it makes Last Rebellion look good", 
      "What’s worse is that’s apparently just a 360 port of an arcade game from 2001!", 
      "It’s a freaking awesome port of a wonderful game. Age has nothing to do with it, VO Force is fantastic and held up wonderfully, at it was great for fans of the series to see it finally released on a console.", 
      "ah, thanks", 
      "It seems like lately, everyone is concentrating their efforts on internal development again.", 
      "While I can understand quality concerns, I’m a bit bummed that this will probably mean less work for smaller developers, and less chances of discovering new talents.", 
      "I honestly didn’t mind A Witch’s Tale being touchscreen-only for gameplay. What I did mind are some of the spell-casting runes that you have to sketch in a single continuous stroke and how the detection on that was kind of off for certain runes.", 
      "Aside from that, I think the bonus area could have benefited from a bit more design consideration.", 
      "I remember that dark period of NIS. I think N.A. received another degree of burns with the botched Rhapsody DS game. Seeing how we never got the PSP game that takes place in the Mark Kingdom (or any of the Mark Kingdom games that are on PSN, and the avatars, etc. for that matter), I’m sad to say that franchise is pretty much dead here.", 
      "BUT, I’m glad to be part of the NIS renaissance era! They really are a mark of quality, and improved beyond compared to any game company I’ve seen.", 
      "I think NIS’ problem is that their fans only buy one kind of game from them and on one platform. They’ve kind of worked themselves into a corner where the only titles that sell are Disgaea games on PS3. This is probably in part due to the fact they haven’t really put a comparable effort into developing high-profile, quality games for other platforms.", 
      "Last generation, a lot of Japanese publishers managed to make a name for themselves on the DS and later the PSP. NIS were one of the very few companies that couldn’t do it. Even Imageepoch who are now known for their generally mediocre games managed to find sales successes on the DS and PSP. If NIS want to see an uptick in how they’re performing, they’re going to need to try to move out of their comfort zone. I don’t know if they’re a small enough company that they can survive off the otaku market alone.", 
      "I think Fate Paradox may be a step in that direction. Take a game which was critically well received yet did not find traction outside its niche, add the recognizable designs of Ito and what seems some care to the story and presentation side of things. It’s still PS3 yes, but Shana for example found a somewhat broader audience in anime.", 
      "Have Fate Paradox be a success and you can then roll those new fans into the portable games from which it spawned.", 
      "The problem is Fate Paradox didn’t really make much of a splash. It sold less than 24,000 copies in its first week.", 
      "That’s the issue, IMO—NIS are a bit of a one-trick pony, and when that trick doesn’t work, they don’t know what to do. Look at that Witch and Hundred Knights game… the first time they actually try to do something significantly different and the game goes into development hell and suffers a major delay.", 
      "Hundred Knights will exist — it’s not vaporware, at least I don’t think so.", 
      "You’d almost think a smart play might be to take advantage of the recent otome and yuri-light craze and do something with Marl Kingdom again. Even if that series is Disgaea’s mother, it never was only a SRPG.", 
      "Yeah, I’m not saying Hundred Knights is vapourware. It’s definitely coming out. Just that it’s kind of odd that anything outside of their comfort zone causes them so much trouble.", 
      "That might just be the problem, once your move a developer from something that they are familiar with… there are a lot of new things that you got to take into account, that takes time and money to flesh all out.", 
      "I am not say that it’s a bad thing, but it does show a level of immaturity on the part of NIS. And really, there is only one way to fix that.", 
      "I don’t really see why they need to expand. If they have their loyal following that buys whatever they put out, they’ll make their money so long as they budget accordingly. And besides, who are they competing against in the SRPG market? Nobody. You could argue Fire Emblem, or the occasional SRPG spin-off of a larger franchise like Devil Survivor, but that’s kind of a different area. There’s nothing wrong that NIS does one thing and does it very well. And I refuse to believe they are somehow doing poorly, considering they have more projects in the works than ever before and are opening a second office.", 
      "Generally speaking, whether they need to expand is not really something that I would concern myself with. Being the consumer at the other end of the spectrum, if I like the product… they get my money.", 
      "My concern would more or less lean to how much money they are spending to product, both new or old IP. Lately, development cost seem to be ramping higher, which is a concern at the end of the day. We’ll see if NIS has kept a fine eye to that as we transition to “next-gen”.", 
      "There is certainly evidence that the cost issue is getting to the developers who have made the games for our niche. Major companies have dropped smaller franchises like Breath of Fire or Shadow Hearts, SquareEnix basically has everything in the FF13 basket, and Atlus has only Catherine and soon SMT4.", 
      "Among the smaller companies NIS has Disgaea in what will soon be its third iteration on the PS3, plus multiple ports of the first two. Complie Heart’s solution seems to be to tighten the customer focus to one part of the niche and save money by far from pushing the tech. Neither of these allow much room to grow an audience.", 
      "In Atlus’ case, I think it’s more an issue of they don’t want to work with current gen hardware more than they can’t. For whatever reason, they don’t like working with HD graphics.", 
      "Compile Heart’s “solution” is hurting their games more than it helps. They’ve shoved out atleast, in my count, 11 games in the past 6-7 years, and all of them fall short compared to their contemporaries. Their “solution” is to reuse every available asset, try holding it together with duct tape and shove it out the door and onto shelves before customers realize it’s falling apart.", 
      "Again, you have no countered my point. I don’t believe two things. 1. That NIS is struggling financially. or 2. That NIS has a bad reputation.", 
      "As noted above, I do think Fate Paradox is an attempt to do something a little different. In the last gen even after Disgaea set an amazing standard for SRPGs, they were willing to tinker with a Phantom Brave, Makai Kingdom or Soul Nomad. A few of the more complex gameplay tweaks found their way back into the Disgaea series, but things have been pretty much the same since D3.", 
      "So currently for NIS games, you either roll with Disgaea or you don’t. The one test subject (ZHP) did birth Fate Paradox so I’m not saying the company is doomed. But remember what was so remarkable about the original Disgaea, it was a JRPG not named Final Fantasy which found customers outside the niche. It grew our fanbase, I just don’t see evidence that any of the PS3 versions have had that impact.", 
      "I don’t see a problem. There hasn’t been any decline in quality. I’d argue, and others have to, that D4 is the best entry in the series since the original. All your proving is that the same people who loved it then still love it now. Why can’t we have our Disgaea games AND they can still experiment on the side, like they ARE doing with things like Witch and the Hundred Knights.", 
      "They made great games, gained a loyal fanbase, and continue to make great games. What do you want from them? Lightning doesn’t always strike twice, I think there’s only so many SRPG fans in the world. I don’t see the niche fanbase growing continuously. It will gain and lose different people but probably remain about the same size. But as long as they budget accordingly, they shouldn’t have any problems.", 
      "It’s not too odd. When you take on something very different from what you’re used to, it’s bound to take time to get used to it.", 
      "Think about Gust and Rorona and At3. Both games obviously showed that Gust was struggling with going 3D. They mostly sold well still because, for one, the previous games had been such a huge departure from the Atelier formula, and so the market was pretty much devoid of that experience, and two, Gust got a very renowned artist to pull off the character designs. As for Ar tonelico, they had the help of Namco with marketing, they had a soundtrack like no other again (hymmnos sell games pretty much xD), and it was also the conclusion to the two games that their fans loved so much. They also did some other things right too.", 
      "NIS is taking a big risk with Hundred Knights, because not only is it a game system they’re completely unfamiliar with, it’s also supposed to be having an atmosphere that their fans are completely unfamiliar with from them, and really has no previous merit to work off of, except that it’s from NIS.", 
      "This could pay off big, but it could also fail hard. It’s going to be interesting to see where this one goes", 
      "Well, in the case of Gust, they managed to adjust very quickly to the PS3, to their credit. Once they had their first Arland game out, it was relatively smooth sailing from there. Meanwhile, here we are, a good six years into this generation, and NIS are still fumbling, avoiding every platform on the market except for one, and even on that platform not putting their best foot forward. It’s a messy situation.", 
      "Yeah, Gust pulled their stuff together rather quick. Though it took them two games to do so.", 
      "The problem is NIS has always almost religiously stuck to the 2D sprite world (and almost exclusively SRPGs) and this has really stifled their ability to branch out much. And while 2D sprites are still appreciated by some, the audience isn’t very large unless it’s a fighting game really. And I feel like the audience for 2D sprites is shrinking.", 
      "So, this has resulted in their experience being very limited when it comes to game design. Making them even more critical of how well they pull off something. For all we know the game could have been decent enough before they decided to delay the game to talk to all these ‘experts’ on Action games. And I’m not saying getting advice is ever a bad thing, just that the huge amount of time without any info did most certainly cause a bit of a hole in the game’s marketing, which won’t be easy to patch up.", 
      "Still, with a proper trailer they could really get people excited for this again.", 
      "I disagree about the 2d sprite thing. Most indie games nowadays are 2d sprites and they are gaining ground extremely fast. The problem is they stick to the same formula non-stop and don’t, as many have said, go out of their comfort zone. There are so many things that can be done in 2d still, and they can make a ton of 2d games due to the extreme downgrade in costs and not needing big dev teams. Imagine if they made the spiritual successor of Secret of Mana in the West. Other Mana games have been released in the West, but none of them had the Secret of Mana feel with action rpg with items drops.", 
      "NIS has a lot of potential, they just need to learn to expand instead of remain introverted.", 
      "But i like that they are one of the few developers still doing some niche jrpg on ps3 unlike most companies that went for handhelds instead.", 
      "I’d love to see a new Marl-Kingdom game come out!", 
      "Hundred Knights…I’m not sure what to think of that really. We still haven’t seen much of anything on it.", 
      "I’m personally hoping that NA sales for Fate Paradox are better comparatively. I have my pre-order in right now, and I hope at least the people on Siliconera who like NIS games will be doing the same by picking it up.", 
      "They have options, Makai Kingdom, La Pucelle Tactics…they could easily cash that cow in for a quick buck if they gave NA the same thing they gave JP. Do what Atlus is doing. Step 1 port them to PS Vita with additional storyline, step 2 ???, step 3 profit!", 
      "La Pucelle would be great, really, but I realize by now that the La Pucelle sequels that they said were gonna be made in the wake of Ragnarok, probably got canned especially /due/ to that period of being in the red.", 
      "I think that’s precisely the problem, though. None of their stuff (except Disgaea) is big enough that they can fall back on it with ports and re-releases. Meanwhile, they’re not exactly doing a good job branching out into other genres/platforms either.", 
      "Doesn’t mean they haven’t tried to hit ports and re-releases pretty hard anyway. It’s not just Disgaea, they’ve ported many of their other internally developed games: Phantom Brave (PSP, Wii), Rhapsody (DS), La Pucelle (PSP), Makai Kingdom (PSP). The only PS2-era RPG they DIDN’T port has been Soul Nomad.", 
      "And I don’t know, there’s something to be said for specializing at the thing you’re really good at. Nippon Ichi are very good at intricate strategy RPGs, and I wouldn’t want them to forsake that at the expense of branching out to stuff they can’t do as well. Maybe work on a good traditional RPG or action RPG in addition to the Strategy pillar, but you don’t want to lose that unique competitive edge in their entrenched genre. I think a company like Falcom does it right – two main types of games with the Ys series as the action-RPG standard bearer, and the Legend of Heroes/___ no Kiseki games as the story-heavy turn based RPGs. Don’t go overboard, and keep quality control high in a limited set of genres.", 
      "I do kinda like NISA’s (the US branch) strategy of filling gaps in their publishing portfolio but still sticking to the overall JRPG genre by publishing games from other developers like Gust, Idea Factory, and Compile Heart.", 
      "Maybe work on a good traditional RPG or action RPG in addition to the Strategy pillar, but you don’t want to lose that unique competitive edge in their entrenched genre.", 
      "What unique competitive edge? @_@ It’s not like Disgaea sells by the buttload, and none of their other SRPGs have posted booming sales either. I mean, I know NIS has its niche of loyal fans, but that’s kind of the problem… that’s all they have, and they haven’t really been able to branch out beyond that, even within the SRPG genre.", 
      "If they were doing A-OK relying on their fans, that would be perfectly fine, but clearly that isn’t the case here.", 
      "I agree Falcom is an example of doing it right. Stay small, stay efficient, put your games out on a variety of platforms. Falcom’s business model is very smart. So is Atlus’ for that matter. Atlus are the masters of asset re-use but no one ever really complains about it too much since they use their assets for games that are always very interesting and very different from one another.", 
      "I dunno, I think sometimes niche appeal is the ceiling for a company. No matter what they do, I just can’t see NIS breaking into a huge new mainstream audience, so it might be foolish to chase “new” and neglect the dedicated niche audience that already does support them. Might just have to ride that out as best they can and hope there’s still an interest in SRPGs (not that they can’t do new and interesting stuff in their genre – say, make a good 3D engine).", 
      "There’s nothing inherently wrong with specialization, lots of the most respected developers are laser-focused on a very specific kind of game. Sometimes it’s a niche audience that a developer serves very well (Cave with shmups in the past decade plus, SNK’s 2D fighters in the 90s-00s, Sierra adventure games in the 80s-90s), sometimes it’s a very specific kind of game that happens to have huge mainstream appeal (Game Freak, Polyphony Digital, Infinity Ward – heck, Bungie has been iterating on basically the same sci-fi FPS idea for over a decade and they’re viewed as one of the current elite US developers).", 
      "A ton of my favorite games ever come from these developers who were true artists for one very specific kind of experience. It’s not really that uncommon for a developer to just do one thing and do it well. It’s far less common to see a smaller developer that’s truly capable of releasing high quality stuff across a wide range.", 
      "How many devs (other than huge publishers with multiple teams and lots of resources like a Capcom, Nintendo, Ubisoft) REALLY can be a multi-trick pony? It’s a rare feat.", 
      "Imo, they should port the games to other systems, especially 3ds and Wii U and make absolutely sure its a quality port instead of a quick cash in.", 
      "Noticed that same trend for NIS in regards to how huddled into a corner they are. It’s somewhat of the reason why I progressively lost interest in their games and found Disgaea 4 to even be rather dull — I can’t find myself even being remotely interested in the next installment they have planned.", 
      "I do feel they ought to try branching out instead of settling on the otaku market alone.", 
      "I love NIS but the only thing I can do is what I have done and that’s buying their games.", 
      "Agreed:) totally with you there.", 
      "I love NIS and what they bring to us. Yes, there were some low quality games, and I never really expected them to sell… However, they’re now releasing three titles this year that fans wanted. I don’t know how well they’ll be received, but I hope that Disgaea D2 and Guided Fate do well. I’m not sure how well the Summer “anime-game” will be received due to Ni no Kuni’s release. People are going to expect that quality of “anime-game” from my perspective. I haven’t played either yet so I can’t really argue that point of view, but I speculate it. ZHP is my favourite NIS game, I even put it above Disgaea; did it have flaws? Most certainly! But so did Bioshock Infinite. I believe in NIS an what they can bring to us, but I agree with other people in that NIS needs to step outside their comfort zone.", 
      "Wishing all the best to NIS, and I’m buying a new PS3 just so I can pick up Guided Fate when it releases. That’s how much hope I have for that game. Still waiting for Disgaea 4 Vita too NIS ;). [this is inevitable, right?]", 
      "Funny because Time and Eternity was in top worst games from 2012 in japan. Pretty much voted by users.", 
      "While that may be true, it’s not everyone’s experience. Now like I said, it does have its issues, I would never deny this fact. However, even with the issues I found the game to still be an enjoyable experience.", 
      "I am buying it entirely for its nostalgia feeling of Thousand Arms. That, and I pretty much buy anything NISA that isn’t Vita only.", 
      "I don’t expect reviewers to treat T&E well at all. Won’t stop me from buying it. And I hope that’s the same for many others so that another game like it can be made.", 
      "It’s a new concept and an attempt at something new. I’d like for them to be able to improve on it in the future.", 
      "My thoughts exactly, my friend?", 
      "If you go in with this mindset, “It’s a new concept and an attempt at something new. I’d like for them to be able to improve on it in the future,” seeing it as the first attempt at a new concept it is (not even Tales has attempted this) and you don’t expect to much…I say you will enjoy the game :3", 
      "Oh boy, if there was a company that suffered at the beggining of the gen, it was NIS. Not only because of these really bad games, but Disgaea 3 was also crushed by everyone by the PS2 Graphics (And, for some bad game mechanics too, I guess… It was my least favorite Disgaea game, for sure)", 
      "But, hey, glad they got past that and gone back to release the great games they’re known for. I really can’t wait for Guided Fate Paradox, I just loved Zettai Hero Project.", 
      "And, hopefully, since The Witch and a Hundred Knights is going to be released now, it shows that they know how to work with 3D now. Seriously, those lame 3D inviroments should just die already", 
      "The dude is being a bit hard on himself. Dude, you’ve made maybe 3 or 4 bad games and upwards of 15-20 great ones. That’s a track record very few devs have.", 
      "Whats a shame is I kinda liked the Last Rebellion and it isn’t a failure in my eyes. Only gripe was the single player system, but I got used to it, and beat the game. I like it when a game tries various combat systems that haven’t been tried yet.", 
      "There’s a reason.", 
      "If they did what you ask, they’d up development costs to a point where it’s completely unrealistic. Better graphics won’t get more people interested in niche content. So their games would cost more to produce and sell about the same. Total waste of resources.", 
      "And D3/4 have so much content without the DLC, that it hardly matters. And if you wait, then odds are it’d get a portable version with said DLC that you can buy for less than the DLC total price. That’s what I did with D3 and it turned out well. And that’s what I plan to do with D4. Have yet to buy any of the DLC.", 
      "Makes me sad to hear about A Witch’s Tale. I’m concerned about them not releasing their port/remakes overseas, like La Pucelle and Makai Kingdom. It could have made a decent splash. But I do have a feeling that their Japanese market is the bigger problem, as the fans seem to have gone down some. Disgaea D2 should have sold more.", 
      "I sense a ZHP 2 announcement.Yeah! I knew it was happening.", 
      "I kinda like Last Rebellion.", 
      "did any of their tactical games had a fastfoward button? for the enemy phase i mean…. that burned my interest for lapucelle and phantom something..", 
      "I bought Last Rebellion when it came out for full price. No regrets. Sure, it’s deeply flawed. DEEPLY… but I still enjoyed it despite it’s flaws. Plus, the artwork was still some of the best I’ve ever seen. So lovely~", 
      "I wanted to pick up A Witch’s Tale, but never got around to it. But now, I pretty much buy every NISA release.", 
      "Im in a similar position. I try to get almost everything NISA brings out except their digital releases only releases. A Witch’s Tale and Last Rebellion are basically the only two I don’t own.", 
      "I think the main reason why NIS end up in this position is simply because they are banking too much on maintaining their fans which in this case have been decreasing each year.", 
      "Not to mention, NIS seems to have some problem on moving out of their comfort zone as we can see that they never meet any big success on DS and PSP platform while many other small companies actually able to take advantage of that market.(Level-5, Imageepoch, even Sega to a certain extent on Miku series while the other series is not really doing well.T_T)", 
      "Here hoping that Niikawa will be able to revitalize the company and bring success to NIS again.^_^", 
      "I laugh at all the FPS addicts who say that Japan is the only country where their Video Game industry is failing. Thinks to himself “These people are dumbasses cant they see that games like COD are hurting the industry cause so many buy them, and the other groundbreaking Innovative titles suffer in sales cause the fans are idiots”", 
      "I mean no offense but the fact of the matter is “The WHOLE Video Game industry is suffering” even EA games is suffering while Craptivison’s COD fans are blind like sheep to buy every game.", 
      "I think it’s about time Japanese developers started dominating the video game industry again. It was only in the 80s, 90s nd early 2000s that the industry was doing well- because Japanese developers were the catalysts thatmade it run and be exceptional. Now other developers have only tried to copy them and even copy each other with only fee developers having the courage to stand on their own while standing on the shoulders of giants all at the same time. If nobody takes the step to make the change then I will. Someday you will hear me industry and know who I am and remember me because I had the vision to make a difference when no one could."

      "2008 must be the year of the dungeon crawler. After what seems like ages between dungeon crawling titles, this year we were treated to a veritable explosion within the genre. With games like Shiren the Wanderer, Chocobo's Dungeon, and of course the newest Pokemon Mystery Dungeon title, this year has been a real winner for fans of rogue-like gameplay", 
      "And it is with this dungeon-overloaded mindset that we begin Izuna 2: The Unemployed Ninja Returns. Although the game references the first title several times, playing the first game is totally unnecessary, as this title is a standalone adventure. Izuna 2 opens with our girl Izuna following her stomach, as usual, all the way to a wedding, which holds the promise of free food. While at the wedding, however, Izuna's ninja cohort, Shino, believes she may have accidentally picked up the trail of her long-lost, little sister. And even though Shino attempts to look for her sister by herself, Izuna and her gang can't help but follow!", 
      "The story here is pretty generic, and while some may be a little bit bored by the run-of-the-mill, \"looking for a long lost relative\" plotline, the game's story is saved from mediocrity by the series' trademark humor. Izuna's clueless yet heroic demeanor is very reminiscent of vintage anime series like Sailor Moon and Fushigi Yuugi, and while some may characterize this as being formulaic, the fact is that it still remains quite funny and really helps you care about the character.", 
      "Aside from the somewhat generic storyline, another aspect of the game that seems fairly standard is the dungeon crawling style of gameplay. You are able to trigger randomly-created dungeons which have an excessively turn-based system, where every step you make, every item you use, and every attack you attempt counts as a turn. And of course, if you die while in a dungeon, you lose everything you brought in to the dungeon including items and money. Izuna 2 also incorporates a co-op system where you can elect to control another character as well as Izuna. However, the co-op is a little counter-productive because you can only control one of the characters at a time, so it is still like having only one character. The other character just goes away until your current character dies or you switch them out. It might have been nice if you could have incorporated a multiplayer aspect with the co-op system, but unfortunately there is no multiplayer aspect of this title.", 
      "One issue I have with the gameplay in this title is it follows the formula a little too closely. As a seasoned player of the dungeon crawling genre, I wouldn't normally hold that against this title, and if you had asked me about it two or three years ago, I would have applauded this title for sticking so firmly to its roots. However, with all the new and innovative dungeon crawling titles that have come out recently, Izuna just feels a too basic in comparison and has no real distinctive elements. Games like Pokémon and Chocobo incorporated elements that made them very unique (like jobs and battle elements), even within their own very specific genre. Izuna's gameplay works on a very basic level, but it just feels a little hollow, without any distinctive characteristics.", 
      "Another issue I have with the gameplay is there is a very weak correlation between the story elements and the dungeon crawling. When it is time for a story element, you'll sit though some dialogue, and then you'll find yourself in the game's village area, with no certain path to the dungeon you seek. Instead, you'll have to start talking to the same 12 or 13 characters until you find the one who will suggest you go to the dungeon. This is very tedious, and makes getting to the meat of the gameplay very difficult. It is also quite unclear why you have to go through these little interview sessions, as the dialogue scenes will generally tell you where to go. It's just a bizarre and annoying facet of the gameplay, and I just can't decipher what its purpose may be."

If you answered “a tie-in game inspired by the film and/or the book,” you’re on the right track with Sega’s upcoming adventure game The Golden Compass. We had a chance to get an early look at the game, which is due for release in conjunction with the film this December.", 
      "The story of The Golden Compass game centers around the main character from the book and film, Lyra Belacqua, her shape-shifting demon friend Pan, and a heavily armored talking polar bear known as Iorek. In the demo version of the game, we got to see Lyra riding Iorek as he trekked through a snowy wasteland, battling packs of wolves as they traveled. As you might expect from a polar bear, Iorek’s abilities are all about brute strength, and he tosses off attacking wolves with ease in order to protect his rider.", 
      "That isn’t to say that Lyra is helpless. Thanks to her demon friend Pan’s ability to shape-shift, Lyra can access areas of the map that would otherwise be unreachable. Though Pan can shift into many different forms in the books, the developers at Shiny have settled on four different forms for Pan in the game: ermine (essentially a weasel), sloth, hawk, and wildcat. Pan and his shape-shifting will be most useful in the platforming sections of the game, where Lyra has to use Pan’s various abilities to get from one point of the level to the next.", 
      "While you might not think a sloth or an ermine would be useful, each form Pan can take offers its own unique abilities. For example, when transformed to sloth form, Lyra can use Pan as an extension of her own reach to grab ledges and poles. In hawk form, Lyra can glide using a double-jump move, and descend huge cliffs via Pan’s hawk-form wings to glide to safety. As a wildcat with Lyra on his back, Pan can climb obstacles that would otherwise be insurmountable. Interestingly, you can switch between any of these forms on the fly; indeed, some of the more difficult puzzles in the game will require you to move from one form to the next quickly in order to move from spot to spot.", 
      "The titular golden compass isn’t used for navigation in the game, but rather to divine the truth about the people and situations Lyra meets over the course of the game. Along with collecting clues about the many symbols on the compass as she navigates the game’s levels, she’ll use the compass to help answer questions that will periodically creep up throughout the course of the game. Though we weren’t entirely clear on the mechanics of how the compass works, it sounds as if it might be add another level of depth to the game’s adventure genre roots. We’ll be bringing you more on The Golden Compass as we get closer to its release, so stay tuned.",

This is where    innovation in entertainment is happening right now,” Mr Levy added.",

      "For Activision, the key attraction was Blizzard, the American software group    owned by Vivendi Games which created World of Warcraft, an online world of    orcs and dungeons that at last count had signed up 9.3 million gamers, each    paying a monthly fee of around £9. The economics of such online games are    very powerful because once the games are designed, they have a steady    subscription-based revenue stream and require minimal marketing, as their    popularity is fed by internet forums and word of mouth. Blizzard, for    example, expects to generate an operating profit of $520m on $1.1bn in    turnover this year – a margin of nearly 50 per cent.", 
      "Getting access to those margins means that the combined group will be ”   light years ahead in terms of operating profitability” of its other    rivals, said Robert Kotick, chairman and chief executive of Activision.", 
      "Activision, which will remain as a publicly traded stock on the Nasdaq    exchange, expects the deal to add to earnings immediately. Under the terms    of the transaction, Vivendi will end up with a 52 per cent ownership stake    in the combined entity through two separate transactions. First, it will    merge its games unit into Activision in exchange for 295 million shares of    the American company’s stock at $27.50 per share. It will then pay an    additional $1.7bn in cash for a chunk of newly issued shares.", 
      "Vivendi could push up its holding to as much as 68 per cent if investors    fully take up a $4bn tender it plans to launch within a week of the deal’s    completion.", 
      "The transaction comes as the world’s big three console makers – Nintendo,    Microsoft and Sony – are set to square off in a sales race pitting their    respective next-generation consoles against each other during the Christmas    shopping season.", 
      "Crucial to winning the sales war is the quality of the games that are    developed for each system. Activision’s Guitar Hero series, which is sold    with a replica Gibson guitar fitted with multicoloured buttons on the neck    that the player has to “play” in time with scrolling notes on the    screen, has been a boon to Sony’s Playstation.", 
      "Mr Kotick will be president and chief executive of Activision Blizzard,    while Vivendi Games’ chief executive, Bruce Hack, will take over as    vice-chairman and chief corporate officer of the combined group. The deal is    subject to approvals from the US and European antitrust authorities and    Activision shareholders.",

      "LOS ANGELES, Calif., November 20, 2007 –", 
      "Sweeney became most well-known for working on Epic’s Unreal engine, the game engine used for the Unreal series of first-person shooters and other computer games.", 
      "For Unreal Engine 3 and upcoming Epic Games titles, Sweeney states that he is not doing as much programming as was done on previous projects, and that he is fulfilling the role of a technical director. His duties include: setting the overall direction of the engine and the various projects based off the technology, meeting with the independent hardware vendors, and doing research and development work for future engine technology.", 
      "Sweeney is frequently considered the counter-part to another famous game programmer, John Carmack. Both are industry leaders in game engine design and, although various tools now allow these developers to program less, it is noteworthy that they simply focus more on engine programming. Testament to this is the next Unreal Engine (Unreal Engine 4) already being under research and development with a team of 1, Tim Sweeney. These new technologies as well as additional programmers take away some of the tedious work of project specific programming and instead allow the game engine programmer to focus on larger and more difficult concepts.", 
      "He is well known for his love of exotic sports cars; he owns a Lamborghini Diablo and a Ferrari F430.", 
      "Tim currently lives in Raleigh, North Carolina.",

Items can augment the relationship with the enemies, such as claws that allow for more damage and different attack patterns, a saddle which acts as armor and gives Chocobo resistance to damage, and collars which could grant powerful bonuses to Chocobo (or devastating ones as well).",

      "Full disclosure: I’m male, and not an expert on real-life romance. As with any editorial, you can take what I say with a grain of salt, and you definitely should. However, I write these because I think there’s an important discussion regarding the place of romance in games, and the place of actual romance games in the game industry and why it’s viable.", 
      "MacDonald gave many examples of games that have romance in them, often as a core mechanic. Japan has an entire genre of ‘otome’ games, or romance-themed games where the story is based around developing relationships with the characters (often multiple). She believes this market can take root in the west, and that western companies can make games like this and find a strong market. She qualified with ‘among’ women.", 
      "Personally, I saw more men than women in the audience, so the games might not be exclusively appealing to female players.", 
      "I think there’s a fear of that. Macdonald’s presentation included a brief mention of that, but the question of sexism and gender portrayal in games is a current and controversial topic. The industry is only recently getting over the idea that male and female players are not entirely separate, mutually exclusive groups that cannot be appealed to together. But one of the things romantic content in games does is foreground the actual issues of sexism and gender portrayal and open them for discussion. To be perfectly frank, the controversy engages players, and it’s simple enough to intentionally evoke issues deliberately and intelligently in order to bring these issues out. Companies can avoid major faux pas by making a visible effort to be respectful, and Western RPGs have a trend towards allowing players to decide sex and other personal factors (also, sexuality, what with LGBT representation in the industry increasing steadily).",

      "The science and magic of developing a game with your community", 
      "kleientertainment.co...", 
      "Speaking from the Klei Entertainment offices in Vancouver, founder Jamie Cheng is as surprised as anyone at the popularity of its wilderness survival game Don't Starve. \"Even the success now was something we didn't expect, there was nothing in our projections like that.\"", 
      "\"Don't Starve was basically our grand experiment, that's how we saw it,\" says Cheng.", 
      "\"We had our other games, Mark Of The Ninja and that kind of thing, and those projects are about 18 months long. For Don't Starve we had this idea, and it started as a game jam, we built it over two days and we really enjoyed the idea. And that was back in 2010, the end of 2010.\"", 
      "\"So fast forward a couple of years and and we've got the opportunity and the timeframe to build this game. But we weren't sure how exactly it was going to turn out, so we decided that we're going to get it out as soon as we can and get people playing as soon as we can.\"", 
      "And that's how the game ended up sneaking onto the Chrome store, a free little oddity. Klei gave itself 6 months to get that working build out, and set itself a rigid schedule to add updates every two weeks. New characters to unlock, new hazards in the world, tweaks to food systems. As a player it's satisfying to feel the game growing around you. For Klei it allows it to get realtime feedback on the development process - and find out what players think about shaving sleeping buffalo creatures in the dead of night.", 
      "\"From a business perspective I felt like if we can build a strong community and we can test with the players as we go along we'll have a much better chance of that spreading over time.\"", 
      "\"For our game especially, having external goals is extremely counter to what is fun about the game.\"", 
      "But these risks and experimentation seem to be what Cheng is all about, he seems to have an actual aversion to the same old, same old approach that is such a big part of the industry today.", 
      "\"I can't speak to larger companies, because I've never run one, but what I can say is that for us it was important for us to have freedom to be able to do the things we wanted to do, and from a business perspective it was a specific goal for me to start to build our company so that we had leeway to try different things.\"", 
      "Klei runs multiple projects at once to spread risk, and ensures it has a steady stream of royalties to make sure those projects are supported.", 
      "\"Let's try things knowing that we'll fail. Knowing that we can fail and keep on trying new things. So that was our strategy, creatively you need that leeway. As everyone knows in the industry the quality of the game is what matters in the end, if you put out a shitty game, you're probably going to be out of business. So you need that leeway.\"", 
      "As for selling a game based around chopping wood and building science machines to an audience more used to shooting men and... shooting men, Cheng reveals it hasn't been as difficult as you might expect.", 
      "\"Don't Starve is the easiest game to sell I've ever had. People look at the game and they're interested. They want to know more about it. They look at the art and animation and say what is that?\" he says.", 
      "\"Our biggest success has been to let the community tell other people, that has worked out fantastically for us. And we enjoy that, because we get to focus on the game and focus on the community, and that community helps us spread the word.\"", 
      "Cheng loves to play as scientist Wilson, mainly because he can grow a fabulous beard (something Cheng jokes he can't do) but there's also something in the mad scientist character that must appeal to Cheng. This is not a man that wants to do the same things as everyone else.", 
      "\"From the perspective of should it be more mainstream, I didn't get into games to be the lowest common denominator, I wanted to do something different, and to me that's the biggest risk of all, to be just simply bland.\"", 
      "Don't Starve is due to be completed in March, but is currently available on both the Chrome Store and Steam in beta form.", 
      "The Klei team , with Cheng farthest right", 
      "Klei was founded in Vancouver in 2005 by Jamie Cheng, using proceeds from the sale of his THQ shares (Cheng was once a Relic programmer) and a hefty loan from his brother. Since then the indie studio has developed a diverse portfolio of titles, including Eets, Shank and Mark Of The Ninja, and currently has a number of other titles, including some that stemmed from game jams, in the works.", 
      "\"We do have game jams every once in a while here,\" says Cheng, \"And the idea is not to have to think about what the business ramifications are going to be of the game that you're making.\"", 
      "\"I didn't get into games to be the lowest common denominator, I wanted to do something different\"",

      "Let’s dial the time-wheel back a little to better understand what that means…", 
      "I went back to my hotel and instantly purchased it for US$13.00 which also awarded me a second copy I could gift to a friend, which I immediately passed along to my PAX colleague. I started playing it that night, and couldn’t stop. The game was uncompromising indeed, but hours later, I realized that in spite of its early development state, there was something about the game that successfully balanced all the most addictive elements of a game – easy to pick up with fast-scaling complexity, logical but interesting tech trees, short and long range goals, discovery, mystery, causality and the non-linear challenge of seeing how long you could last before your own idiosyncratic impulses led to your untimely and irreversible demise in an open world.", 
      "A tall, thin man in a pinstriped suit welcomes Wilson (or on of several other unlockable characters) in the midst of the wilderness, with naught but the clothes on his back. The first stages of his survival require him to gather food, and materials for a fire that can last through the night. To accomplish these tasks, the player can mouse over various items on the screen and click to interact with them. Some will result in picking up a resource that can be used or combined with other elements. Others (such as trees and large rocks) might require the acquiring of buildable axes, pickaxes or shovels as the case may be, before they can be manipulated.", 
      "By climbing this gradual hierarchy of needs, Wilson can eventually create a Science Machine, allowing for the creation of more advanced implements. While the milestone is impressive, the new creations should be pursued with caution, as Wilson will still meticulously gravitate towards malnourishment without the occasional roasted rabbit or two.", 
      "I learned this the hard way. After a series of moderately successful rounds of survival, I encountered my first gold nugget, and eagerly constructed my mechanical brain-booster. I toiled over new tools and niceties well into the night. It wasn’t until I noticed that my health was plummeting that it dawned on me: It had been nearly a full two days since the last time I trapped a rabbit. Scouring my inventory revealed that all of my edibles had gone into my brainy exploits. My quest ended, and I was returned to the title screen. Oh, right…Don’t Starve…", 
      "In hindsight, The Science Machine was but the tip of the iceberg. The Alchemy Engine opens a second tier of goods that be can prototyped from more refined materials. Whip up a crock pot, an ice box, and a drying rack. Not only will you be able to keep meat from spoiling for longer, but by combining meats and veggies, you can whip up tasty treats that come packed with boosts to all three attributes.", 
      "Should you choose to explore the entirety of the crafting tree (note: it gains branches with every content update), the capability is there for Wilson to create a wealth of helpful items that will assist him in farming, the preservation of food, and weaponry, but only if he doesn’t first keel over from hunger.", 
      "This delicate balance is what generates the real challenge. You’ll need to scavenge and hunt to keep your belly from shriveling into a husk, but you need to make discoveries and create new items to keep your mind active. While a starvation death makes for a far more drastic end, losing your mental focus will result in the emergence of ethereal shadow beasties. They’ll only lurk near you at first, but for each Cocoa Puff you drop in the insanity bowl, they get more and more substantial.", 
      "Eventually, you’ll be battling it out with invisible critters that can nevertheless sink their fangs into you. Also keep in mind that every time you start a new game, (which will be often when you first get going), the world is randomly-generated. There are extensive controls for tailoring in what way it may be generated, adding biases for certain elements etc.", 
      "In some games I had a world of grassy pastures patrolled by manure-dropping beefalos, while others were chock-full of pig-men and spiders at war with one another.", 
      "In some there were gold nuggets literally laying about as if they were raining down from the sky, while others I couldn’t mine a gold vein if my life depended on it, which made any scientific research impossible and starved me out intellectually, rather than physically.", 
      "All of the beasts (real or shadowy) share a cartoon-like whimsy. Most of them look rather harmless, but getting too close or carelessly lashing out at any of them can result in a quick death, or a run that will take you far from camp. Some beasts will require you to develop some hefty upgrades before they can be feasibly confronted, but most of them are going to trounce you if you’re fool enough to challenge a pack.", 
      "Not all critters automatically want to eat your face. Some can be bargained with, and might even toss a few haymakers about should a nefarious brood of pack animals decide you smell delicious. There’s nothing worse than getting gang-mauled and having your carefully constructed slice-o’-paradise go to waste, so make friends and don’t be afraid to sweeten the deal with a savory morsel here and there. You can even gain the knowledge of how to construct domiciles that will attract allies; think of it as a primitive barracks at the edge of town.", 
      "Alternatively, and perhaps the better solution, is to build your HQ in a savannah, near a dense cluster or rabbit holes, and then, once you are far enough up the tech tree, build a hammer and break down some pig houses to relocate nearby. This way you will have a steady supply of food to dry on meat drying racks (that produce jerky) to get you through the long winter. Don’t forget to lay as many traps as you can over those rabbit holes though!", 
      "In the event that you are having trouble making friends with any of the strange creatures in the strange land you are inhabiting, there are (sometimes) shrines that you can tap which will allow you to resurrect your character, albeit without all of the materials he or she has so painstakingly gathered. Alternatively you can build a meat effigy deeper along the tech tree. Perhaps the gods of Don’t Starve are merciful after all?", 
      "And this sense of loss – rez spots or otherwise – is where the game will polarize players – some may find it simply far too exasperating to lose so much time with nothing to show for it but some daft memories, and maybe a character unlock. Others will find this is survival, time-management game a big slice of Heaven pie…", 
      "Well, I got schooled. Gathering and hunting is a noble and exciting path all its own, and this is what Don’t Starve relies on, because what combat there is, is decidedly unfair in the enemy’s favor, and provisional at best. By the way, this is not a criticism of the combat, it is a necessity in the world of the play as it heightens the nightmare belaboring your character – like trying to run from a killer, but not ever gaining any momentum. In fact, the false sense of security that spears, fire darts and twine armor afford, is an ingenious way of heightening the sense of fear, urgency, dread and suspense in the 2D world Klei has created.", 
      "For those who find time and resource management and experimentation the height of entertainment, Klei has created a gift for you wrapped up in big pink bows. Striking a careful balance between your hunger, health and sanity is addressed in a manner far more creative and generous than simple gauges that rise and fall (there are now mods that allow you to repurpose the GUI for when you mean business) – they have gone a step further to artfully craft the symptoms of their effects into the very fabric of the experience.", 
      "Once you have got your bearings, figured out the tech trees, and maybe even made it through winter, having crafted some bunny muffs, a puffy jacket and a barbecue, with your trusty heat stone safely stowed on your person, it may be time to finally leave the endlessly fascinating variation of the sandbox and find out just what in the darkest of hecks is actually going on.", 
      "Because in fact, that tall man in the pin-striped suit you met way back at the beginning of this Count of Monte Cristo-like prison? His name is Maxwell, and he means you no good. In fact in a sort of JJ Abrams style twist of fate, you may in fact be a pawn in some far deeper endgame, and the only hope of respite for your soul, is to track him down and figure out what it is he wants from you after all.", 
      "Suddenly the game opens up into a whole new scale, as you discover a strange mechanical device marked “Maxwell’s Door” and upon engaging it are warned that you are about to leave the little concept of a world you have thus far fashioned, behind – along with everything you have so meticulously gathered – and leap into a far more perilous odyssey.", 
      "Needless to say, many may never even arrive at this campaign mode, but it is rather remarkable that an entirely separate kind of game exists beyond the initial scenario to which you are presented.", 
      "Six months after my first taste, the company had released a series of updates and patches, all of which added substantial new gameplay elements – weather, mental health gauges, new beasties, additional crafting, rich modding tools, and even a new underworld (still a work-in-progress), all of which also recursively improved the way they had been done up until that point.", 
      "Many suggestions came from the user forums, and many of those were considered or addressed in some way directly by the developers. This long paid beta, and wide-open transparent dialogue with the public was a very alluring and evidently successful collaborative method for improving the game in the direction that its demographic desired, but never cowing to their every whim – thus maintaining its integrity whilst demonstrating the framework to be adaptable.", 
      "I stepped away from the game in this time, just to give it some breathing room in hopes that I could see it more clearly as the full game it was destined to become, and I was simply astonished by the amount that was added from the time I first got hooked all those months before. It had already been a fun, engaging, and highly replayable title, but now it had enough variety that even two good solid nights of play still had not revealed all that there was to discover. Indeed a year later, this remains true.", 
      "I will say, that every so often, on my Quadcore laptop with integrated AMD graphics, the game can sometimes choke up a little, and I have to close all other running applications or restart the game. Other times, when I would try to plant something, Wilson seemed unsure of what I wanted and would stutter back and forth in place until I reclicked in a spot that pleased him. Perhaps this is intentional, but it looked glitchy, and not something that should be happening this late into release.", 
      "I am not exactly sure I can blame it on the game, but it may be a little further optimization is required on the dev’s side. It most definitely is not a killer, but it is there and worth mentioning, as so much timing and precision is required to beat the three clocks you have constantly ticking down, and stand to lose so much, that smooth gameplay is a must with this title.", 
      "For example, when you have only moments of daylight left and your fire needs to be built and you left it too late, you could technically build a campfire, but if clicking doesn’t happen in a split second, all goes dark and you are going to die at the hand of the boogeymen. At one point I was trying to click on my logs to add fuel to my campfire, but they would not pick up, and then there was no turning back, so yes, precision and timing matters and any lag on the game’s part can cause you to lose hours upon hours of work.", 
      "Only for this reason, and the fact that it may not appeal to everyone for its “uncompromising,” unforgivingly grindish mechanic does it not get the perfect score it otherwise more than deserves.", 
      "In fact Don’t Starve is easily one of the most engaging and entertaining games of 2013 or any year, in any category – the artwork, with its Georges Méliès styled undulating ocean waves, the beautifully sinister Klezmer soundtrack and woodwind-voiced avatars, the time management game design are all creatively first-rate and compose a deliciously villainous universe to romp around and tinker with. The animations all feature lovely subtle variation, and every object in the world feels alive, even expressive – from the way the trees pop up or shrivel, to the vast array of critters fluttering, skittering, crawling and stalking about, all with unique proximity responses to your player character.", 
      "The updates keep coming – new characters have been added, along with new craftables, whole new zone types (the bunny caves which can be accessed by mining randomly placed sinkholes), all manner of creatures and “power-ups”. What Klei has done is defined, in the best way, a new legitimate way of procedural game development; rather than charge a smaller sum for these expansions under the guise of downloadable content (aka the ubiquitous “DLC”), they simply keep expanding the original idea with a healthy dose of feedback, suggestions and requests from the growing fan base. It is a case study in how to do this right.", 
      "A little over a year since I first started playing Don’t Starve, I feel like I have barely scratched its necessarily multi-terrain surface – the same surface that now covers an even more mysterious subterranean adventure and answers to questions, so very many questions…",

      "Dinofarm's Keith Burgun on roguelikes, licences and the future of the industry", 
      "Dinofarm's decision to take an obscure genre and turn out a high-quality, high-price-point iOS title seems to fly in the face of the current swing towards cheap, franchise licence material. However, that decision seemed to pay off when the reviews started rolling in - journalists and critics praised the game for its flawless presentation, generous levels of content and deep mechanics. But how did that convert to sales?", 
      "We spoke to Dinofarm's Keith Burgun, lead designer on 100 Rogues, to find out if he'd do it the same way again, and where he sees the market moving in the future.", 
      "So it's really tough. It almost seems like we have to have a constant media campaign, every day to make it bring in serious money.", 
      "First of all, when we started out, our game was $4.99, which was very expensive for the App Store. Also, it's a little bit less casual than most App Store games. We were trying to make a game which could exist on any platform, really. I think 100 Rogues could be a PC game, it could be a DS game or a console game. We were trying to make it work well on the device, but we weren't really trying to make an App Store app. We were just trying to make a game that we would really love.", 
      "So that's another factor, as well. But yeah, that top-heaviness is really rough. At the end of the day it comes down to how much we invested in that game. If it was a much smaller project, like most apps are, what we'd be making would be closer to financially rewarding.", 
      "I'm trying to establish our company, Dinofarm Games, and I'm trying to show that we're a company that loves games and really wants people to think \"these guys really care about games, they love games, they know games.\" So that would be important for me, but yeah, the scale would defintiely be smaller.", 
      "We had something like six months of free updates, one of which increased the size of the content in the game by something like 30 per cent. We had so many free updates before the Skellyman Scoundrel was released. By then we really just wanted to try something different, which was why we decided to see how it worked as an in-app purchase.", 
      "So it's done okay, but we thought it was going to be a much bigger deal, sales-wise. We thought it was going to be... It did okay at first, it seemed that everyone who wanted it, got it. Then, pretty much it seemed that we just had to keep hammering away, media-wise to make sure we were getting any significant sales, for the character or for the app itself.", 
      "I think that it's frightening when I look at the App Store and look through all the apps. It seems to me that there must be some studios that put out an app almost every day, you know?", 
      "If we were a bigger game... maybe. I think it would require a totally different model than what we've been working towards.", 
      "Sometimes it's simply impossible to do so. If that's the case then that's the case. As long as it's a possibility it should always be made a priority to take care of your games. I think that Vesterbacka was absolutely right - I think it's threatening, not only your own game, but I think in a way it actually threatens the whole industry.", 
      "Everybody knows about the crash that happened in 1982 or 83, and that was because of a similar problem. I don't really know if that can happen again today, but it seems like we're asking for it, a lot of the time.", 
      "The people who own Android are a little bit different, I think. A little more techy, perhaps a little more familiar with Roguelikes as a genre. I just think that it might work out a little better. We kind of just can't afford to port the game. It was coded in objective C, in Apple's nice little walled garden, and to port it we'd have to re-code it from scratch. We just can't afford to do that, at this time. We'd love to, in the future.", 
      "Our next game is going to be an Android game, actually. We've already begun development. It's a little similar to 100 Rogues, but as I said, a lot smaller scope. Much more focused design.", 
      "When it shipped in the US it came with this hideous box-art, it had no PR whatsoever - they kind of bungled the release. Really that's an example of how you can absolutely make a roguelike game super-popular. I think someone's going to do that, eventually, and that's what our attempt with 100 Rogues was. Because, inherently I think that roguelikes meet all of the standards required of a popular genre.", 
      "They're a quick, pick-up-and-play arcade experience because it's just a one-shot, let's see how well I can do, Pac-Man and Galaga experience. They have the RPG elements which have now crept into every single genre in existence.", 
      "The reason they're niche is because the presentation has never been there. 90 per cent of roguelikes have been graphic-less, ASCII games which required you to memorise fifteen hot-keys to be able to play. Which is obviously not something most players are willing to do.", 
      "My games are like my babies - I want to take care of them as long as I possibly can.", 
      "You know, 'this is Halo, but with, I don't know, Jurassic Park', something everyone knows and loves. I think that is causing massive damage. Not just to the industry but to people's perception of games. I'm a real fighter for games' legitimacy. I really want people to understand that games are important, that games are culturally relevant. I really resent that kind of attitude, it holds us back.", 
      "But would I do it? I may, if I was really struggling. I wouldn't be happy about it though. I have a bunch of friends who work in the industry and I would not want to work at a big, triple-A studio. I mean it's not something I would remotely want to do. I'm very happy to be where I am, an indie who can actually make creative decisions. Make the games I want to make.", 
      "I think that the industry, in the future, will be a lot smaller. I think that video games have achieved, in the last 20 years, this bizarre, rockstar status in our culture. Because of that, our industry has become way bigger that it ought to be.", 
      "That causes a lot of problems because when the industry is that big, and you get studios that are that big, you have to do the sort of stuff that Eric Brown was talking about. It's not their fault, they're right. When you get to that sort of outrageous size, you do have to do that sort of stuff. Everything is going to get smaller. Games are always going to be important, they're always going to be huge, but they're a little bit crazy right now.", 
      "If you look at board games - it's an industry that's doing pretty well, but there's a lot of quality. It's mostly people who are really into games who are into it, it doesn't have the same status as video games, where everybody is supposed to be super into it. I think that the way that the boardgame industry looks is something like the way we can imagine a future video games industry looking.",

There is a priority to attacks however, so if you are adjacent to an enemy, and attempt to move away, they will attack first, otherwise, your character attacks first. Throughout the dungeons, there are treasure chests, which contain items, or occasionally, enemies. As well as surviving the creatures of the dungeons, you must make sure that you do not loiter too long on one floor, as throughout the game your belly decreases. It starts at 100 and decreases slowly. When it reaches zero you begin to lose one hitpoint per turn. You can refill your belly by eating food found in the levels, or by drinking a potion.",

      "The Dark Genie, an ancient evil evil power has been awoken by followers after centuries of sleep. He unleashes his wrath upon the world, supposedly destroying virtually every person and structure in the world. One boy, Toan, from the small village of Norune survives. An old mystic reveals himself to Toan as the Fairy King, the one who saved Toan from being destroyed with magic. It is revealed that the fairy king protected all the structures, objects, and people in magical spheres before the genie could destroy them. However, the magical spheres, or Atla, were scattered into many dungeons by the genie's powers. Toan must take the sacred Atlamillia stone into the dungeons and use it to free all the people and their belongings and restore them back to their rightful place, before going on to defeat the Dark Genie.", 
      "Beginning with his home town of Norune, Toan collects the various pieces and residents of the town within the Divine Beast Cave and quickly rebuilds the town before facing the first boss within the game, Dran, the Divine Beast himself. Within the cave, Toan first encounters Seda, a mysterious man who attacks Toan in several instances throughout the game. After defeating him, Toan finds a magic potion which is able to transform a stray cat into the first companion of the game, Xiao. After bringing Dran back to his senses, Toan quickly progresses to the forest village of Matataki. There he finds the same destruction as with his own homeplace. Venturing into the Wise Owl Forest, Toan is able to bring the ancient tree, Treant, back to life and restore the village. Treant is able to give him the Serpent Sword, a legendary sword said to be the only way of defeating the Killer Snake within the forest. After doing so, Toan is able to convince Goro, a local mallet wielding resident, to join the party. After defeating Master Utan, a giant monkey in the center of the forest, Toan finds Brownboo Village where the Moon People live.", 
      "Discovering the only way of defeating the Genie is to travel to the Moon, the Moon People reveal that there is a vessel that can transport them there hidden within the Sun and Moon Temple, but to power it, the Moon Orb which (somehow) was transported to a port, Queens, which was mistaken for fruit. After fighting his way through an ancient shipwreck, rebuilding Queens and defeating the Ice Queen, La Saia, Toan and his party retrieves the Moon Orb. At this point, Ruby, a genie, joins the party after vowing to remove the shame cast on her kind caused by the Dark Genie.", 
      "With his party assembled, Toan makes his way through the desert to the Sun and Moon Temple on the outskirts of Musta Lacka. There they meet Ungaga, a warrior who is ashamed as he was unable to help his village following the attack. Fighting their way through the Sun and Moon Temple, it is quickly apparent that Ungaga's skills will be needed to make their way through the temple further. A Moon Person, Theo, that was accompanying the party brings him to his senses and Ungaga joins the party. With Musta Lacka rebuilt, Toan and his party venture into the very heart of the temple, defeating the King's Curse, an evil spirit from long ago and find the Moon Ship.", 
      "From there, the party travels to the Moon, where they discover a massive weapon which is planned to be used to combat the Genie. However, the lead designer, Osmond, lacks the parts necessary to complete the Giant and requests that Toan and his party retrieve them from Atla Spheres within the Moon Sea, a massive network of craters. With the Sun Giant complete, it requires a power source, one that can only be acquired from a competition within the Colosseum. After defeating Minotaur Joe, the Sun Giant with Toan and his party inside sets off to fight the Genie in single combat. After an epic battle, the Dark Genie is defeated and the party lands at Dark Heaven Castle.", 
      "Inside, Toan encounters Seda yet again, who reveals that he made the Genie and that the only way to truly defeat it is to travel back in time and destroy it when it was first conceived. After travel ling back in time and unravelling Seda's memories, Toan discovers that Seda was once the Prince of the East when he fell in love with a woman called Sophia. The West then waged war against the East and the East very quickly began to lose. Offered a chance to save his kingdom by a mysterious old man, Seda received vast powers that enabled him to win the war with ease. However, when he returns from the war, it is revealed that an assassin has killed Sophia and taken her place. When Seda discovers this, he is heartbroken and from this rage and sadness, the Dark Genie is born. Discovering this, Toan finds himself at the birthplace of the Genie where he engages it in combat. After defeating the Genie, Toan and his party where they return home to the celebrations seen at the beginning of the game.", 
      "Georama is the world construction mode. Each time an Atla sphere is collected in a dungeon, it can be opened and the contents can be place in the town, the player being able to arranged the objects however he\\she may like. Any people or objects found must be attached to the house they belong to before they can be placed in the world. For example, Macho can not be placed back in the town until Macho's House is also found, so Macho can be placed inside of it, and the house can be placed in the world. There are also environmental elements that can be found such as trees, roads, bridges, lakes, rivers and hills. The challenge comes in when each person in the town has their own desires for the rebuilding of the town. Each person will give the player a reward if their desire is met, and if the entire town is satisfied, the player will receive a great reward. For example, and old fisherman may ask that his house be placed next to a fishing pond, however, someone else may ask that they not be placed near the old fisherman because they do not like him, and so on. Each town becomes a puzzle in itself, challenging the player to work to find the perfect placement for each structure in each town.", 
      "The majority of the game's action will take place in the large dungeons near each of the towns in the game. It is essentially a traditional dungeon hack. The player must traverse through many identical, randomly generated floors, battling monsters, collecting items and Atla, searching for the key that will take them to the next floor and the next floor until they finally reach the boss at the bottom.", 
      "The most risky aspect of Dark Cloud is the weapon deterioration. Each time a weapon is used to attack an enemy, it 'weapon HP' meter depletes a little bit. The player must use a repair powder item on the weapon to restore its WHP before it reaches zero, or the weapon will break and disappear forever. Because, as explained below, the weapons in Dark Cloud are responsible for all the stats of a character except thirst and HP, permenant weapon breakage in Dark Cloud is akin to permanent character death in other RPGs.", 
      "Unlike most RPGs in which the characters level up, in Dark Cloud, it is the player's weapons that level up. Each weapon gains experience points from killing monsters. Each weapon can also be socketed with stones that offer statistical bonuses. When the weapon levels, it will absorb the stones permanently, allowing new stones to be placed in the sockets.", 
      "Where this system becomes really interesting is when weapons themselves can be broken down into stones, retaining many of their stats, which can then be absorbed into another weapon, fusing both into a brand new weapon. The most powerful weapons in the game can only be attained by fusing many weapons together over time.", 
      "Each character in Dark Cloud has a thirst meter represented by droplets of water in the top left corner of the screen. In dungeons, the player's thirst meter will slowly deplete. To refill the meter, the player must always carry bottles of water, or find one of the springs throughout the dungeon. If the thirst meter becomes totally empty, The character's health will slowly start to deplete. Although this became less tedious throughout the game, due to the fact that the thirst meter becomes greatly elongated, ultimately it was more annoyance than good gameplay, and was removed from the sequel.",

      "Yeah. That was just a bit of wishful thinking on my part. Level-5 is always going to stick DQ to the biggest install base, so a 3DS DQ is most likely. The online aspect however might give them pause, since DQX didn’t really become this big thing they were expecting.",

      "Interesting. I had no idea that some of True Fantasy was salvaged for use in Rogue Galaxy. It’d be interesting to see it come full circle like that.", 
      "That combat system just screams MMO. Timed attacks which piggy-back off each other for increased damage. Early bosses and maps also look almost identical to things shown for True Fantasy.", 
      "Hm. Good point about the combat. I hadn’t seen anything from True Fantasy, so I’d never have noticed the visual similarities. Very interesting. I really do hope they bring that full circle and do a Rogue Galaxy MMO then.", 
      "You still need to come at least say hi to us on twitter sometime, dude.",

      "I’ll probably make a Twitter one of these days, but I can never keep up with social media. One of these days! *shakes fist*", 
      "We don’t keep track of who keeps up and who doesn’t. Just know the invite still stands.", 
      "Huh… didn’t know that… It would explain some of my issues with Rogue Galaxy.",

      "Ya pretty much everything you don’t like is the MMO speaking. Healing isn’t so tedious if there’s always a WHM player. And of course every ‘great’ MMO must overwhelm ya with twenty billion menu choices.",

      "And now I already have to buy a PlayStation 4.", 
      "So much hardware, so much hardware.;_;", 
      "I own so many consoles by this point just to play exclusive games that I swear I could build a computer with two GeForce Titans in SLI for the same price. Oh console exclusives, you cost me a pretty penny.", 
      "Which is the main reason why gaming is more or less the most expensive hobby you can hoped for lol.^_^", 
      "Not even close, really. Being a musician is the most expensive hobby I’ve been a part of, but luckily for me I like gaming more.",

      "Are you saying the PS4 will cost as much as 2 gtx titans? that’s $2000. Sony already said, the PS4 won’t cost above $500.", 
      "No, I’m saying my huge collection of consoles has cost as much as an extremely high end computer would.", 
      "Some of these I’ve piled up over the years. So it isn’t so fair to count them since they were good during their time. But a lot of these are recent purchases. All of which add up to well over $2000. Especially by the time I purchase a PlayStation 4 to add to my collection.", 
      "Think of it this way. New graphic cards come out so fast that in 2 years time the Titan will be outdated. But the PS4 will still keep you going with new gorgeous games :)", 
      "Well, both of them will become “outdated”. And both of them will keep me going with new gorgeous games.", 
      "maybe a new Dark Cloud game. Dark Cloud 2 was one of my favorite PS2 games and im surprised that it hasn’t shown up on PS2 Classics section of PSN.", 
      "This. This so much. Every day I pray that Level-5 does an HD collection of Dark Cloud 2 or just announces a sequel to it.", 
      "HD COllection would be amazing. Im still hoping for a HD collection of Xenosaga but I doubt it’ll happen. It’s already long way overdue :(", 
      "Rogue Galaxy 2 please!", 
      "I tried to like Rogue Galaxy but the constant need to heal got tedious. Dark Cloud 2 however is one of my favorite game ever.", 
      "You think the constant need to heal was tedious?", 
      "How far did you get in the game?", 
      "Edit: Because… let me tell you, and the fans of the game won’t like it but… The game was just filled with tedium in terms of it’s gameplay as you advanced forward…", 
      "And this comes from a guy who spends many hours doing nothing but item worlds in Disgaea and overgrinding in the too-many dungeon crawlers he owns… While simultaneously loving just about nearly every genres of games…",

      "Jade Cocoon 3?",

      "Genki. Level-5 would actually be a pretty nice fit to take over the series though, now that I think about it…", 
      "Dark Cloud 3", 
      "*GASP* O_O", 
      "Definitely not DQX since Level-5 didn’t develop that, and unlikely to be DQXI since Square Enix has all but declared that series Nintendo exclusive. I’d love to see Level-5 do another single-player DQ, but that in itself looks unlikely since Squenix has been playing up the series’ multiplayer for two games now. If and when it does happen though, it’ll likely be for Wii U or 3DS.", 
      "First Bayonetta now DQ XI *sigh* well that’s nintendo’s strategy….", 
      "The DQ relationship is a bit different. Square Enix doesn’t have to keep the series exclusive to Nintendo, but the DS and Wii’s larger install base led them to do so this gen. The 3DS is most popular now, so the series will likely remain with Nintendo.", 
      "Dark Cloud 3 or Rogue Galaxy 2 and I’ll get it for sure.", 
      "Rogue galaxy 2 Ç_Ç yes! so many yes!!!", 
      "My head will explode if it’s related to Rogue Galaxy (I really want that IP to make a comeback, man), but I’m excited regardless of what it ends up being.", 
      "Level-5 has been one of my favorite devs for a while now, and they’ve yet to let me down. So I’m really, really, really looking forward to seeing what they do on PS4.", 
      "As long as it’s more like DQVIII and Rogue Galaxy and less like… every mediocre title they’ve put out in the current gen, I’ll be happy.", 
      "Rogue Galaxy was mediocre though.", 
      "Edit: yes, I expect a lot of sudden hate by this statement… But… It really is just an okay game… And okay is pretty much the equivalent of mediocre.", 
      "Rogue Galaxy was awesome though.", 
      "I think Rogue Galaxy is the way to go, but with the world creation abilities in Dark Cloud, there are some interesting opportunities.", 
      "I dunno… I just couldn’t stand White Knight Chronicles, and Ni no Kuni wasn’t that better either… It’s hard for me to get hyped", 
      "Agreed about WKC, although Ni No Kuni was/is flipping awesome!", 
      "Trust me, I really wanted to like Ni no Kuni (I mean, I’ve payed full price for it), but… I just couldn’t.", 
      "I’ve beaten the game, but the more I played, the more bored I was", 
      "That’s okay.", 
      "I’ve seen a lot of praise tossed towards it… From my personal observations? It’s a fine game but it’s understandable if some aren’t exactly finding the gameplay all that appealing.", 
      "I personally dug it….. And now I’m thinking I want a new Monster Rancher game… I know it’s not Level-5 that makes those. It’s just thinking about Ni no Kuni somehow makes me want a Monster Rancher game.", 
      "Dark Chronicle 3 Yes Yes or Ni No Kuni 2", 
      "Just imagine, Rogue Galaxy 2 which also has some kind of online to it. That would be nice =^_^=", 
      "If it’s Rogue Galaxy 2 or something of the sort… So long as they fix the many little issues the first game had and give combat a proper bump and more variety.", 
      "And by variety, I don’t mean having a single gun that breaks shields that needs only be fired once at the enemy to make them defenseless to your regular attack otherwise they’re invincible if you don’t use that gun type of variety in combat… Which honestly wouldn’t be so bad if there was some way to rapidly switch between weapons.", 
      "Please be Dark Cloud 3.", 
      "If yous people ever do get the chance to do a Rogue Galaxy 2 for the PlayStation 4, your company, Level-5, will deserve a High-5.", 
      "I think this is new IP.", 
      "I wonder what kind of game it is. I’m really curious and interested~.", 
      "This just gives me another reason to own a ps4 :D, I really hope its a sequel to Rogue Galaxy. That game really deserves one, Jaster’s story isn’t over!", 
      "“Figuring out how to use network functionality is paramount.”", 
      "Yeah, too bad you don’t have a series that’s all about network functionality or anything…", 
      "My guess at the moment is another WKC or a spiritual sequel to it.", 
      "My heart would go to Dark Cloud though… But I’m fairly sure that series is over with.", 
      "They’re kinda establishing a pattern here, though.", 
      "They seem to be like Naughty Dog in that they have this mentality of “new console generation, new IPs.” It’s not strictly a bad thing, but it leaves fans who wanted more a bit out in the cold.", 
      "whatever what game is it i buy it if iscome to the west Level-5 always made great games", 
      "Just going over the comments, I’m a little surprised at how many people want more Rogue Galaxy. Only one other person I know in real life knows what it is, so I’m glad it’s popular somewhere. :>", 
      "I’m probably going to get a lot of hate but.", 
      "Rogue Galaxy was rather unimpressive as a whole and underwhelming. And that’s jumping into the game with zero expectations… Hell. It took me getting halfway through the game until I began to realize “oh hey, it’s made by Level-5″.", 
      "So yeah… My opinion here is stated purely from what I’ve played with no regard whatsoever to the company that built it or it’s history and with zero idea of what I was getting myself into. And that opinion makes me surprised that Rogue Galaxy is relatively well spoken about…", 
      "Okay, the start was promising, very promising. I really dug it at first, it certainly gave a slight Star Ocean feel to the whole thing and had a slight western deal that was reminiscent of Wild Arms to me, just a slight bit, the active battle system directly in the map we traversed was entertaining and whatnot…", 
      "But then some minute little troubles came creeping up, which forced dull repetition into combat that flowed relatively well but didn’t evolve much past what was first presented save for three gimmicks, one being to jump on enemies to stun them, another to jump attack them to make them vulnerable or deal damage pending the enemy and the last being the more annoying one, being that Jaster was the only character with a shield breaking gun that dealt extremely low damage. And there isn’t a lot of guns that can break shields… Actually I think there’s only one gun that breaks shields because I don’t remember ever seeing another one.", 
      "The flow began to stutter and interrupt itself. I was alright with it being a pretty cookie cutter story because, hey, to me it’s sorta like a throwback. Simple, fun, classic boy becomes hero may or may not be born from a legendary person, very run of the mill but nice presentation…", 
      "But the gameplay just stuttered and eventually grinded down to a halt. Every battle felt the same, if they didn’t feel the same it felt like the game was just forcing me to play with a relatively useless gimmick outside of those gimmick battles and even then it didn’t flow very well, jumping wasn’t exactly the best of things to control in fights and changing guns was a hassle. While you could just stick with the shield breaking gun you kill about a quarter to a third of your combat option which really stiffles the gameplay and the presence of these shield enemies discourages experimentation with your party composition and then there’s the fact that you get a full field damaging skill pretty early with every character which makes every fight a breeze to the point where the game might have benefited from having a much smaller encounter rate with more substantial battles instead so to better capitalize on the fighting system and not overplay it until it was a dead horse beaten down by just how long it had to walk down the same repetitive straightforward path.", 
      "And then there was me finding out I could get an end-game sword within the start of the game… With relative ease… And I did… Prior to actually looking up a faq to discover that yes, I had accidentally created an end-game sword that could fare all the way to the end… Making the weapon crafting system somewhat superfluous but still, hey, it’s there it’s not bad… But even that became slow because that’s a whole other bit of grinding that just felt superfluous and tacked on…", 
      "Rogue Galaxy was one of the very few PS2 games without load times in-game (thanks to SCE, I imagine.) Being a very long game on-top of it and being easy to find and cheap (SCE again) made it popular amongst those that got it.", 
      "A lot of people had tolerated Xenosaga, so something along the same lines in terms of repetition and availability minus the down-time was appreciated.",

      "Izuna and her friends — Shino, Gen-An (a.k.a. “Grandboss”) and Mitsumoto — have just lost their jobs as ninjas in the city, so they’ve got to find a new place to live. They come upon Kamiari village, which they decide to make their home. After going on a quick tour, Izuna is told to go find Gen-An, and heads off in search. Eventually, she gets to the village’s shrine, where she spots a beautiful gem, and Izuna decides to snatch it for herself. This is generally not a good idea, as it usually leads to some kind of retribution.", 
      "Right on schedule, Izuna’s actions anger the six gods protecting the village, and somebody’s got to pay for it. The gods curse the village and everyone in it, causing them to act strange. That is, except for Izuna, oddly enough. Realizing the trouble she’s caused, Izuna sets off, determined to kick the gods’ butts and restore everyone to their old selves.", 
      "The game also has a “fun” little clause in it that when you pass out from losing all of your HP, you happen to lose any items and money you have on you as well. Anything you’ve got saved in the storehouse remains there, but there are times you may want to throw your DS at the wall after losing a prized weapon or item.", 
      "This isn’t a game that you’ll just put down after beating the last boss, though. They have gone to lengths to make the game very replayable, including a new mode once you beat the game where the bosses start leveling up to become tougher each time you face them. Alongside the randomly generating dungeon maps, there are endless hours of fun for those who enjoy the dungeon crawler genre.",

      "Nich Maragos: Your ninja instincts have not failed you: this is a roguelike or \"mysterious dungeon\" type game, where the dungeons Izuna faces are randomly generated every time she enters. Enemy management and survival are the key things to occupy players in Izuna, since you’ll have to start from the beginning every time you exit a dungeon, and everything will be completely different than when you left.", 
      "The entire game is played on the touch screen, but Izuna herself enforces a strict \"No touching!\" rule.  The game didn’t need touch controls, and the developers didn’t force it in there.  Combat and exploration are handled on the lower screen, while the map on the top screen acts as the HUD.", 
      "Since this is a dungeon RPG there’s going to be a lot of combat. How does Izuna bash monsters?", 
      "The actual act of combat is simple, in keeping with the DS’ mandate for accessibility: just press the A Button to attack the space in front of you. But slugging it out with monsters directly is a good way to have your HP sapped, which is where the game’s depth comes from. Izuna can use ninja talismans with various effects, as well as ninja tools like shuriken, kunai, and caltrops to thwart enemies from a distance.", 
      "Dungeon RPGs are typically more difficult with lots of leveling up. What’s the difficulty in Izuna like?", 
      "It starts off easy, letting people get used to the game, but gets pretty tough. Eventually level advantage becomes useless and bulldozing through the game is no longer an option.  You’re going to have to power up your weapons and think about every step you make.  Even then, there are some aspects of Izuna that are more forgiving compared to some other roguelikes, One such instance is the fact that though you lose all your money and health and have to start from the beginning of the dungeon, your level doesn’t reset.  That being said, gamers looking for a challenge will find one here.", 
      "A little of both… One of the odd things when working on Izuna was that a lot of the situations lent themselves to humor–like the premise of the unemployed ninjas, and the ridiculous curses that affect the townspeople–but the actual dialogue was pretty tame. So although we left a lot of the villagers’ lines more or less alone, we focused on making Izuna herself funnier. Since she’s involved in just about every conversation in the game, there were plenty of opportunities to do that.", 
      "What are some of the difficulties in localizing jokes in Japanese to English?", 
      "It’s usually something culture-specific. Izuna is set in a rural Japanese village during the feudal era, so there was a chance some things might not translate–though oddly enough, now that you mention it, we didn’t have as much of a problem on Izuna as on some games. I think you can attribute that to the way Japanese pop culture has soaked into our audience enough by now that they’ll be familiar with the setting. Aspects of the game that might have been difficult ten years ago, such as casting spells with small paper talismans, are easily understood now.", 
      "It’s rare that you won’t have the opportunity to talk to someone again, so the dialogue options are mostly there for fun. You can say whatever you want, and if you didn’t like the response, just try the other one. We tried to make every choice worth exploring.", 
      "When I first heard Izuna in the announcement she sounded kind of ditzy when she said \"Ninjas are sooo yesterday\". What kind of character is she?", 
      "Ditzy isn’t quite the word I’d use. Izuna isn’t dumb, or at least not in that way. She was a really fun character to write, because she’s full of herself in the way a modern teenager would be, but she slowly gains the skills to back it up. She’ll go after something she wants with everything she has, regardless of the consequences. No matter how arrogant or obnoxious she is, she eventually wins people’s respect, because her absolute persistence gets results.", 
      "Which is really a reflection of the way people should play the game: if you lose the first time, hang in there until you show ‘em who’s boss!", 
      "Editors note: You’re going to have to hang on when you play Izuna: Legend of the Unemployed Ninja. While she’s got shuriken throwing skills, Izuna doesn’t hold up well when she’s surrounded. You can’t just run in and start hacking away, you’ve got to put some thought into each step when a group of monsters appears. Also as Nich says Izuna’s isn’t dumb, she just sounded like that when I first heard about her. She’s actually a pretty cool character, something like an American teenage ninja.", 
      "What, no Touch screen function??? I’ll probably have to change my vote on that game.", 
      "A DS game should use of of the DS’ feature such as:", 
      "If it doesn’t do any of that, it’s nothing but a GBA game that uses the DS’ graphic capability :(", 
      "I find that very sad that you won’t get a game because it uses every single darn function for the system. That is just ignorant in my opinion and you could miss out on a game you really might like you loss, deeply.",

      "The generation (PS2, XBOX, GameCube, GBA) really let me down. Most games were nothign but ports, sequels and games with the same concept. Yes, every system had their unique games, but not enough unique games on one console to make me say “Wow, that was a great console for it’s time”. This was not a problem for occasional and newer gamers since they was still a lot for them to discover, but for me, bah, been there done that.", 
      "It wasn’t until I purchased a DS that I realized what I was missing, fresh game ideas. I was ready to give up on consoles and simply stick with my DS because there is a lot fresh game ideads on that system and that the XBOX 360 (at the time) only had the same type of games that the 1st XBOX had with better graphics. But after seeing E3 online, I decided to give consoles another chances and bought a Wii on launch. I don’t regret anything.", 
      "So to summarize, Pichi, I’m not a game whore. I have develop a fine gaming taste with years of experience and now I know what I like and what I’m willing to pay for. Nothing published by Atlus can be considered a AAA title, so with no usage of any of the DS’ feature (not to mention looking like a GBA game), Izuna will probably be one of those games that will not be put back on shelves after 4 months.", 
      "Innovation, that’s what the DS is all about. If you’re not gonna use it, you’d better publish the DS game of the year if you want my money.", 
      "I don’t believe in that at all! That’s like saying books are inferior just because it still uses words instead of pretty special movie effects! That’s just crazy, IMO. I’m shocked because you’re an old school gamer and yet your one of those types that “any innovation = AAA game!!!” No, just no…",

      "Hey kid, if you’re willing to spend $40 on this thing, knock yourself out, but don’t come crying to me when you can’t even sale it back on eBay for half of what you paid for.", 
      "Give me the game for $5 and I’ll play it, but anything higher than that is not worth it. Oh and BTW, I know it’s asking a lot for you youngsters these days, but try to read carefully. I never said “innovation = AAA games”. I won’t detail your mistake anymore than that, go back and read.", 
      "Hey dude, I’m a 22 year old woman who has played since NES, not exactly a kid you know. ~_^ Your just four years older. ^_^", 
      "To me, it just seems like your brushing off any game that doesn’t take advantage of the DS reguardless of the possible innovation of gameplay that doesn’t use it. And what about games that tacks on touch screen?", 
      "NSMB just seems hypocritical to say, IMO. But to each their own…", 
      "BTW, hon, I don’t sell my games. ^_^ Story, characters, and gameplay makes me very happy reguardless if a game isn’t flashy graphics or don’t take advantage of the hardware.", 
      "Remember folks, don’t turn your back on the old. =)", 
      "Not just games that do not take advantage of the DS, but the entirety of this site. I don’t think I have seen him praise a single thing here. Also, last time I checked playing a game was about having fun, not whether or not you can turn a profit.", 
      "To say that the PS2, XBOX, GameCube, and GBA were a letdown, is just unheard of.", 
      "As for Atlus, the Shin Megami Tensei series come to mind.", 
      "Someone is perpetually irascible.", 
      "“Innovation, that’s what the DS is all about. If you’re not gonna use it, you’d better publish the DS game of the year if you want my money.”", 
      "i really dont want his money. in fact i dont want anything to do with him! a fine gaming taste? more like an arrogant outlook on video games", 
      "Alright, you guys are all able to talk big, but talk is cheap, let’s see you put your money where your mouth is. 02/20/07 is the current release date, one week from this date, I want to see a pic from each of you proving that you purchased it.", 
      "If I don’t see a pic from one (or all of you), I’ll come to the conclusion that you read the reviews before buying and found out that it was a total let down and not worth purchasing.", 
      "Oh and Pesmerga00, if you would remove the following titles from existence: FFX, GTA3 (all versions), Halo (1 & 2), SSBM and Wind Waker, the console sales for the previous generation would have been much lower, making it one of the weakest generation. Doesn’t take a genius to figure out that this entire generation relied on a few key titles.", 
      "I’m honestly going to buy it despite reviews. If I listened to reviews, I would have missed out on TONS of games I enjoyed! Sorry, I don’t have a digital camera, but rest assured I’m getting this baby! ^o^ If Atlus has a preorder bonus, I’m SO there!",

      "What, not Digital Camera, no Webcam to take pics (every women online I know has one), no scanner or all in one printer that includes a scanner?", 
      "Perhaps you should concentrate in buying AAA titles and save some cash to buy one of those devices. Games are great, but you can’t cut on today’s electronic essential.", 
      "It also doesn’t take a genius to figure out that sales are not everything. According to your logic; low sales=bad game, which is simply wrong. As I find most enjoyment from RPGs, the PS2 is certainly not a disappointment. You are missing out on a lot of good games with that attitude. I guess that doesn’t matter though, because it is all about money, and sales right?.", 
      "Must be fun living in Candy Land, can I join you? It would sure be a good change from the real world where everything does revolve around money.", 
      "Now getting back to reality, here’s a cold hard fact. In NA, Altus is a company the will publish the Japanese games that no one else wanted to touch. Sure some titles like Trauma Center are good and are worth picking-up, especially used or on sale, but Atlus is not the company that will publish AAA titles, companies like Ubisoft, Activision and SEGA will pay big buck to publish those. Atlus is basically the last resort and although the games they publish aren’t all terrible, Izuna will not be the title that will impress the people looking for something innovative on the DS nor will it attract the", 
      "….nor will it attract the graphics freaks out there. There are far superior RPGs out or on their way to DS.", 
      "So, should I expect a pic of that game from you the week following the game release?", 
      "Candy Land eh, you should join me, it is a lot better than your spiraling pit of despair. Yes, the world does revolve around money, but a low budget does not spell ruin for a game. Besides you are completely missing the point. There are plenty of fantastic albeit, low-selling games out there.", 
      "I don’t know where you get your facts from, but you couldn’t be further from the truth. Atlus has quite a few excellent games.", 
      "Also I do not recall ever saying I was going to buy Izuna. I was simply pointing out your fallacies, but you go on ahead with those sweeping assumptions, and generalizations you have.", 
      "While it is nice to take advantage of the abilities of a piece of hardware, some games lend themselves to more traditional control schemes. Take for instance Smash Brothers; if Smash Brothers Brawl shipped without a GC or classic controller setup practically everyone who played Melee on an advanced level. I don’t want to think of how to Wiivedash. That being said, this game could have benefited from some touch screen controls, but it also is difficult to find a balance between dpad for movement and buttons for controls that allows for stylus use.

      "While consoles do have some system movers, the majority of sales don’t depend on only one game, but rather, lots normal selling games make the bulk of the money made, there’s a game for everyobody, and there different perspectives of what is a “AAA” title; for example while GTA is a series you would probably consider “AAA”, it’s not a game that attracts me one bit, and while Final Fantasy X is probably the best selling RPG of PS2, I would hardly say it’s the best; even though sales were phenomenal and they were among the best selling games ever, the approval of the masses doesn’t really mean they’re the best; i’d have Suikoden V, Valkyrie Profile 2, Xenosaga or any Megaten game over FFX any day and ANY game over GTA.", 
      "Also, have you played a Castlevania game for the DS? I have both and both are great, but if there’s one thing i hated about the first one was the tacked on touch screen support; lo and behold the sequel didn’t have it; it was really uncessary and bothersome, and the sequel was really better, proving that games don’t have to be gimmicky (even though on a gimmicky console) to be fun.", 
      "All these titles were stellar in every aspect, all offered innovative gameplay, beutiful graphics and sound, yet weren’t financial succeses even though they were critically acclaimed, aslo note that even though they were done by the “strong” companies you mention, they didn’t sell well; and btw I don’t know were you get that those companies only make “quality games”, because they make tons of garbage, tasteless sequels and rehashed ideas for everyone good game they make.", 
      "Now just to end my commentary here’s the list of various “AAA’ titles published by Atlus through their history.", 
      "Yes, they are probably niche titles, bot all of them are tons of fun and deep as hell and from an “hardcore” point of view, most of them deserve more sales and are better made than many mainstrem success titles.",

      "SMT Nocturne, Disgaea, Atelier Iris, not in 2006 but good game none the less. I’m sure there are others, but I will only comment on games I have played.

      "SEGA and Midway have barely published AA titles in the last few years.", 
      "Ubisoft just keeps coughing sequels and ports and unless you count the Greatest Hits version of God of Wars that came out this year, SONY had no AAA either.",

      "Everyone has different opinions, and I respect that, and if you want to judge games by how many “A”s they got, go ahead, but imho, most games’ enjoyment is more subjetive than objetive (proveed by how you didn’t like both of the “AAA” titles I mentioned)and a number or letter really doesn’t do justice to most games.",

      "Looks like cesca and I are trying to say the same thing, but it is an up hill battle. If you only play the games magazines, and web sites tell you, then good for you.

      "Well let’s face it, 2006 was not a great year for most companies. But with that being said, if you were to look at the “History of games” of all the companies, AAA titles do not rank high Vs pretty most companies, I think I would only rank them above Acclaim and LJN.",

      "Please, missing out on Final Fantasy or Diablo clones is not a miss period. How many decades can buy the same game over and over and be proud of your purchase. If Zelda Twilight didn’t have innovative controls, I would have waited for a price drop before buying it. Although I don’t consider Wind Waker a failure, I was disappointed that the gameplay was too similar to Ocarina and Majora.

      "So by your the way you’re defining me, you should be owning and/or renting every games out there. But you probably don’t, so saying that I was a snob to judge games the way I did when you’re probably doing the same thing makes you an hypocrite.",

      "Your theories intrigue me, I’d like to subscribe to your newsletter.", 
      "Most of these I’ve pretty much summed up with my posts. So if all of these are wrong, then the only way left is to try the games before judging them. Now is that what you do?", 
      "I have already passed judgment on Izuna by saying it will resemble a basic GBA RPG because it will use none of the DS’ features in a useful way and because of the simple fact that it practically looks like an old SNES RPG (which the GBA is full of).",

      "Obviously, the importer, you’re a rather avid debater, but don’t go bashing people just because of a game, (which ironically has disappeared from the discussion) and while you might respond to every claim everyone makes with a “justification” of why everybody’s wrong, that doesn’t make what you think the “right thing” in the matter; also when people are saying to “not diss a game because of the x feature isn’t used”, they are reffering to games you’re interested in, for ejemple, in your first post you said you “would change you’re vote on the game” because it didn’t the DS unique’s features.", 
      "It’s unreasonable for you to say that if we’re not dissing games for “x” thing, we should be buying/renting them all; that’s just stupid, everyone has genres they don’t like or games their just not interested to, obvuiously nobody has the time/money to but everything; it’s you’re tastes and they are respected, it’s just that in most people eyes you’re reason for dissing the game seems stupid, that’s all.", 
      "Oh, and about SEGA, Ubisoft, etc. “passing” on some games, and then smaller companies picking them up that’s just rubbish, there’s thing such as copyrights, company profile and target market to keep track of; Altus focus market is obviously the J RPG/quirck niche, while UBI aims for broader market, and mostly most companies develop their own games of have hired studios to do so specially the big companies, so they won’t bother going out of their company, just in some very rare cases.",

      "Well now that every results are in, I’ll tell it like it is.", 
      "First let’s summarize the main points. Please note that the usage of “You” will be used to talk about everyone here that participated in this discussion minus yours truly since I’ll be identifying myself as “I”", 
      "-I made an judgment of a NDS game because it will lack any usage of the DS’ special features", 
      "-I’ve been told that my way of judging a game is wrong and pretty stupid", 
      "-I’ve stated that people judge games before they try them all the time", 
      "-You’ve said that games need to be tried before passing judgment", 
      "-I’ve said that you are hypocrites for not buying the game if you believed that trying before judging it was your way of thinking", 
      "-You’ve said that trying every game is not possible due to time and financial issues", 
      "-You’ve said that everyone have their taste in gaming", 
      "Alright, so let’s start with that last point and try to connect these dots. Everyone has their taste in gaming, true and fair enough.", 
      "So let’s take Japanese turn base RPGs. If you love Japanese turn base RPGs, then with the idea of trying games before judging them and not relying on everything else would mean that you must try (renting and/or buying) every Japanese turn base RPGs available in your region.", 
      "Now let’s add the time and financial factor into this. You’ve said that because of time and money, it’s impossible to try every game of the type you’re into. So the big question remains, out of all of the games of the type that you like, how do you choose the ones to play? Now I doubt that you’re doing your choices randomly, so that only leaves judging a game before playing it.", 
      "I took Japanese turn base RPGs for a good reason, because in North America, Square games, more precisely the Final Fantasy franchise, is used by a lot of people for judging this type of game. When an upcoming Japanese turn base RPG is aanounced, some people look at the pictures, view the videos, read the previews and then compare it to past experience gaming (Final Fantasy) and use their gaming knowledge to judge the upcoming game and come to the conclusion of if they will purchase it or not. The same principal applies when the game is out but instead of using previews, they’ll use reviews and the opinion of people they know that have tried it.", 
      "Like it or not, this is the strategy that the majority will use to pass judgment on a game. If this wasn’t the case, they’re wouldn’t be more game review websites than gaming companies. Odds are, if you’re not trying every games in the types that you like, you must be doing that as well. In the end, it’s judging before trying.", 
      "Now that we have established that, let’s look at my scenario. I’ve passed judgment on a game before it is release because it will not use the special features of the NDS. Now I’ve been criticized for my method of judging, you’ve said that I’ve judge the game before trying it using a rather dumb method. But let me ask you, what justifies the method that the majority uses to pass judgment and why is it better than mine.", 
      "The reason I’ve been criticized is for the same common reason that humans generally criticize someone’s unique ideas, because it’s to different than what the general mass is used to. A fine example is how both the DS and Wii were criticized for failure before their release and how after their release, well that all changed. The idea behind these devices were new and people we’re unsure, so they made up their mind before they were release.", 
      "What I’m looking for in a DS game is something that takes advantage of what the DS has while the majority will look if the game resembles something that they’ve played before to see if they like it. To put it in a real life scenario, I have women’s clothing and I need a female model to wear them in a fashion show. I can’t hire a man nor can I hire a woman that won’t fit in those clothing. It doesn’t matter if the man or the woman that couldn’t fit in them were good looking, I need a woman that fits into those.", 
      "To me, seeing a company make a DS game that doesn’t take advantage of any DS features is just like taking advantage of a popular movie or TV show and making a game about it (license games as we call them). 95% of the time, these games will suck balls, but they still manage to sale enough to cover the cheap development cost and to make it little profit. Why? Well it’s because some the fans of the movie or TV show that this game was based on jumped on it without thinking (mostly young or novice players).", 
      "Companies are taking advantage of the DS’ popularity and are also taking into consideration that a lot of popular companies are bringing their RPG franchises to this platform. RPGs have proven that they can use the DS’ features, so for this game (Izuna) not to do so is a clear sign of laziness on the behalf of the creators.

They're voting with their wallets--and we are grateful that there are enough of them asking that we can justify the cost of developing the content,\" the representative stated.", 
      "\"We're mindful of it, and the corollary is that with a lot of games today, three updates later, it's a nice evolution of that game--it's a different game that's been modified and adjusted, based on what people are enjoying and having fun with. And we think that Achievements should match that,\" he said.", 
      "\"Especially if a game's been on the market for a while, and they have the opportunity to add all these new Achievements--if you start playing a game a year after it ships, there's probably 2000 Gamerscore to get for that game or more.

That every Xbox One can be used for development,\" Xbox corporate vice president Marc Whitten said in a statement. \"That every game and experience can take advantage of all of the features of Xbox One and Xbox Live. This means self-publishing. This means Kinect, the cloud, achievements. This means great discoverability on Xbox Live. We'll have more details on the program and the timeline at Gamescom in August.\"", 
      "According to the report, a \"cacophony of naysayers\" pushed Microsoft to reconsider its position on the matter. The new terms reportedly will allow developers to choose release dates and pricing.", 
      "The move would put Microsoft in line with Sony and Nintendo, which have said that they will allow developers to publish their own titles on the PlayStation Network and Nintendo Network, respectively.",

      "There is concern about the potential for negative impact of video games on youth. However the existing literature on gaming is inconsistent and has often focused on aggression. Health correlates of gaming and the prevalence and correlates of problematic gaming have not been systematically studied. We anonymously surveyed 4,028 adolescents about gaming, reported problems with gaming, and other health behaviors. 51.2% of the sample reported gaming (76.3% of boys and 29.2% of girls). There were no negative health correlates of gaming in boys, and lower odds of smoking regularly; however, girls who reported gaming were less likely to report depression, and more likely to report getting into serious fights and carrying a weapon to school. Among gamers, 4.9% reported problematic gaming, defined as reporting trying to cut back, experiencing an irresistible urge to play, and experiencing a growing tension that could only be relieved by playing. Boys were more likely to report these problems (5.8%) than girls (3.0%). Correlates of problematic gaming included regular cigarette smoking, drug use, depression, and serious fights. Results suggest that gaming is largely normative in boys and not associated with many health factors. In girls, however, gaming appears associated with more externalizing behaviors and fewer internalizing symptoms. The prevalence of problematic gaming is low but not insignificant, and problematic gaming may be contained within a larger spectrum of externalizing behaviors. More research is needed to define safe levels of gaming, refine the definition of problematic gaming, and evaluate effective prevention and intervention strategies.", 
      "Multiple research gaps exist presently. First, not all adolescents play video games, and the health correlates of gaming (e.g. relationships with drug and alcohol use or depression) are incompletely understood, as much of the published research has focused on school performance, obesity, and aggression. Second, the likelihood of gaming, and the clinical correlates thereof, are likely to differ by gender, and sex differences in gaming and its health correlates are poorly understood. Third, much of the research on gaming has utilized online samples of gamers or small groups of individuals identified as having problematic gaming behaviors, presenting problems for generalizability. This study utilizes survey data from a large sample of adolescents and examines the prevalence and clinical correlates of gaming, reported problems associated with video games, and the prevalence and correlates of problematic gaming.", 
      "In most cases, the entire student body was targeted for administration of the survey. Students were told that they could voluntarily refuse to complete the survey if they wished and were reminded to keep surveys anonymous. The survey took approximately 50 minutes to complete.", 
      "The measures used in this analysis included self-reported gender, race, ethnicity, grade, and family structure (living with one parent, two parents, or other family structure).", 
      "Health and functioning measures were categorized as presented in the tables and included: grade average; extracurricular activities; lifetime smoking history; lifetime marijuana use; lifetime history of a sip of alcohol; current alcohol use among those with a history of any alcohol consumption, categorized as none, light (1-2 days or drinking in the month), moderate (3-9 days of drinking in the month), and heavy (10 or more days of drinking in the month); lifetime use of other drugs; caffeine use; report of being sad or hopeless for two weeks or more in the previous year; getting into fights requiring medical attention in the previous year; carrying a weapon such as a knife, club, or gun to school in the past year; and body mass index (BMI) as calculated from self reported height and weight.", 
      "Respondents were asked to report how much time they spent playing video or computer games in a typical week. Respondents who reported “None” were classified as non-game players. For those who played games, the frequency of play was categorized as less than 7 hours per week, 7-14, 15-20, and 21 or more hours per week.", 
      "First, demographic characteristics and health correlates were compared between respondents who played video or computer games and those who did not, stratified by gender, using Chi-square tests for categorical variables and t tests for continuous variables. Second, logistic regression models were fit to assess the association between each health correlate and playing video games, adjusting for demographic differences. Interaction terms between gender and health correlates determined whether the associations were significantly different in girls and boys.", 
      "Next, among the sub-sample of respondents who reported any game playing, those with problematic game playing were compared to those with non-problematic gaming, stratified by gender for bivariate analyses. Logistic regression models were fit to examine associations between health correlates and problematic gaming, adjusting for gender and race. There was insufficient statistical power to test gender interactions in multivariable models.", 
      "There were significant gender differences in patterns of gaming and problems with gaming as well. Girls as compared with boys more frequently reported playing fewer than 7 hours in a week, and 14% of boys reported playing 20 or more hours per week. Girls also reported problematic gaming less often than did boys. There were 84 boys (5.9%) who endorsed the three problem measures, while only 22 girls (3.0%) did so.", 
      "This study is among the first and largest to examine clinical correlates of video gaming and problematic gaming in a community sample of adolescents. We found that about half of the students reported gaming, concentrated among younger students and more common in boys.", 
      "There were no significant negative health correlates of gaming in boys, likely reflecting the popularity and normative nature of such games for this group. Additionally, boys who reported gaming were significantly less likely to report being a regular smoker. However, among girls gaming was associated with modestly lower risk of depression and moderate increases in serious fights (OR=1.7) and carrying a weapon (OR=2.1).", 
      "We also found that among boys reporting gaming, 5.9% endorsed problematic gaming, compared to 3.0% of girls reporting gaming, suggesting that male gamers may be at higher risk for developing a gaming problem, but that overall the risk of developing a problem is relatively low. Problematic gaming was associated with some important risk behaviors, with moderate effects sizes found for depression (OR=3.6) and fighting (OR=3.0), but was not associated with grade averages, extra-curricular activities, marijuana use, or alcohol use.", 
      "The gender differences observed between gamers and non-gamers, coupled with the contrast in frequencies of gaming across gender, is suggestive of a gender-specific self-selection process. That is, while gaming may be more appealing to boys in general, it may be particularly attractive to girls with particular characteristics. Although causality cannot be examined in these cross sectional data and competing hypotheses not eliminated, this finding may suggest not that gaming leads to aggression but that more aggressive girls are attracted to gaming as a recreational activity. The finding may also reflect cultural differences in socioeconomic conditions at home and in their communities: it is possible that girls who live in more violent neighborhoods, where they are more likely to experience fights and to carry a weapon for protection, are also more likely to be attracted to gaming, may be more likely to spend time with male peers who are themselves gaming, or may prefer to stay home and play games rather than be outside in dangerous communities.", 
      "The finding may also be reflective of personality characteristics that are more externalizing; girls reporting gaming are not only more likely to get into fights and carry weapons, behaviors generally considered to be externalizing, but also are somewhat less likely to report feelings of depression, which would reflect more internalizing patterns. An additional possibility is that gaming may exert a positive effect on mood in girls; however, this hypothesis and the precise nature of the relationship warrant additional study in longitudinal investigations.", 
      "Among boys, the finding that gaming is associated with more pro-social or beneficial behaviors, such as less cigarette use, may reflect a different peer group among gamers. As noted above, the general lack of associations between health behaviors and gaming in boys may also reflect the normative nature of gaming for boys in the current US culture.", 
      "Boys were significantly more likely than girls to report problems with gaming. When examining the three measures of an ICD, a relatively low but important proportion of both boys and girls have gaming problems. Further research is needed to examine the accuracy of self-reports of such problems, and whether these or other questions are the best way to assess impairment related to gaming. It is possible, for example, that some of the items may be endorsed as a “badge of honor” (e.g., claiming to have a problem or an irresistible urge to play as a sign of a ‘serious’ or very experienced player).", 
      "The results of this study suggest that adolescents with problematic gaming are more likely to also be engaging in other risk behaviors such as smoking, drug use and violence, and are more likely to report depression. It is not possible in these data to determine whether problematic gaming leads to experimentation, aggression, or depression, vice versa, or the factors develop in conjunction, perhaps related to common etiological factors such as the violence content in games, or other common underlying traits such as introversion/extraversion, impulsivity or sensation seeking. Future longitudinal research is needed to examine the onset of risk behaviors in temporal relation to gaming and their potential roles in the development of health problems.",

      "The developers have often spoken of the goals and tactics they'll use to incorporate story into Diablo III. They're aware that while some players read every NPC dialogue and really get into the lore and plot, a lot of players simply click through every dialogue in their rush to kill more monsters. The developers therefore try to incorporate an interesting story, and allow the key points to be absorbed very quickly, while providing more depth and detail for players who want that.", 
      "Though the developers have shared few details about the game's plot, the basics are known.", 
      "Fan speculation has run rampant and there is no consensus, but many fans feel the Black Soulstone is a shard of the Worldstone, which Tyrael shattered after Baal's death.  Why it's black, where it's located, and what it's been doing for the past twenty years is entirely unknown.", 
      "A quick summary of what's known, with some educated speculation added to flesh things out.", 
      "The setting and events of the final act remain a complete mystery. The only clues so far released came from the developers stating that the overall game structure of Diablo III will largely follow that of Diablo II, with the final act more of a finale than another full-sized act. Thus a return to Hell, taking the battle directly to the home of the invaders, is not out of the question.", 
      "In any event, it seems like the story and plot of Act Three will point directly towards a fairly brief and linear experience in the final act. (Until the expansion. And the second expansion.)", 
      "From what the Diablo 3 team has said about the state of the world at the start of the game, and from additional information included in the D3 cinematic teaser, this is the apparent state of the world. This summary incorporates some speculation.", 
      "After the conclusion of events in D2X, including the slaying of Baal, his vast armies remained a threat to the Barbarian lands even after Baal's death. Their threat was ended by the explosion of the Worldstone, which destroyed Mount Arreat, blasting Arreat Crater, an explosion that devastated the remainder of Baal's forces and ended their siege of a major Barbarian city.", 
      "Closing this storyline would presumably mean that Diablo IV would be set in a very different time, in the land of Sanctuary. It could be long before the current series, or far in the future. The team would be unlikely to change the overall dark and gothic feel or tone of the game, since that's what makes Diablo unique. But they'd probably like to have different plot points than than the 3 Prime Evils roaming around, Tyrael showing up to help humans, etc.", 
      "Nothing is yet known about how Diablo 3's story will unfold or end, so it will be interesting to see how the team wraps up this story. After all, while Diablo 1 clearly ended with evil, at best, scarcely contained, Diablo 2 seemed a more final conclusion. The three brothers were defeated and their soulstones smashed. Only the destruction of the Worldstone provided a cliff hanger of sorts. Diablo III's plot, which will presumably continue through at least 2 expansion packs, will provide a more definite ending, tying up all the ongoing loose ends.",

      "There are a number of general Lore terms that are good to know:", 
      "Each monster type has usually its own back story, and stored on each monster page:", 
      "LB: Well the way we have to approach it, we think of it as a story told in layers. For the player who is just going to click through everything, we need to deliver a compelling story that is very quick to grasp and has the basic elements you need for getting to your next quest objective and understanding what's going on, but we also want to keep a little bit of the emotional impact in there - we want to make sure that it feels like you're doing something as opposed to just running around and clicking on things - we want to make it feel like there's some sort of context."

I think it may be that you are rushing yourself and just trying to be quicker, or that we had no practice.  I bet gunslingers in the old west that were successful at duels usually didn't shoot first, they just shot more accurately.  Now I need to go look that up.",

The accounts showed the rate of growth of the companies’ business, the continuity of growth, the size of the companies and their profitability.The turnover of all 193 companies increased by nearly five per cent during the 2012–2013 financial year, whereas the turnover of Finland’s companies overall declined.",

They were usually found through cooperation between the entrepreneur and the students. The projects comprised topics such as drafting a marketing plan, expanding a market area, and starting a completely new business.", 
      "The entrepreneurs felt that collaboration with the students had gone well. There were a few meetings in which the scope and the goals of the project were discussed. Many of the entrepreneurs said that quite a few of the observations that had been sparred over in the meetings had brought them valuable information already during the projects. The students' independent working methods and their commitment to the projects were praised by the entrepreneurs – they are skills that will also be needed in professional life.", 
      "This is the result of a new study. The study makes evident that a lack of sales competency in the founding team cannot be substituted by marketing or further product development capabilities.",

      "In the very initial stages of the company founders should concentrate on not only developing the product or company but also on developing their own selling capabilities actively with customers. In addition, according to Pitkänen, hiring more experienced sales people and utilizing the know-how of experienced entrepreneurs could also increase proactive selling.", 
      "The study of 113 startup companies from various industries began in 2011 in conjunction with the Aalto University Start-Up Center and Aalto Entrepreneurship Society. The research concentrated on the first significant sale of a startup company. The result was that, along with focusing on the development of the business, the first significant sale has a very influential impact on future sales growth over the long term. From this it was determined that the commercial and entrepreneurial capabilities of the founding team are crucial in determining the nature of the first major sale.", 
      "- Although entrepreneurs understand the importance of commercial skills, these are too often neglected in the initial stages of starting the business, said Pitkänen. This is particularly the case for founders of high-tech startups. Our research suggests that ignoring the initial commercial side of the operations would be to the detriment of the long-term future of the business.", 
      "These findings also have significance for start-up incubators and investors.", 
      "- Of course the product has to be interesting, work well, and add value to the customer. Yet, founding teams should combine an entrepreneurial mindset with a commercial spirit and the potential to develop their commercial capabilities, added Pitkänen."

      "doing that might accidentally stop the more important functions such as breathing. i think if you induced a dreaming state and then just controlled the dreams to be the game that would solve the need for a safety measure but i’d still put one there just in case. also the technology for “mind controlled gaming” already exists. i did a paper on future user interfaces for computers and found some really cool stuff.", 
      "Actually an induced sleep paralysis would work and they have already done a lot of research into what causes that, not that there aren’t enough other issues to overcome.", 
      "it is almost impossible to control dreams and you cant really do anything inside a dream think about it", 
      "Not really :/", 
      "actully if you have the right amount of focus and will when entering sleepmode you will not control your physical body but your dreamself this being the virtual body allowing you to focus all physical nerves to your dream you can control the setting your intresets and even taste or hear your dream will asleep you can feel around your dream or taste food in your dream without moving your body this resulting to movement and control of your dream so if you think about it you could turn your dream into a server and connect with other people while they are asleep this resulting the MMO sleepserver or SAO", 
      "when you dream all of the movement impulses are in you brain they don’t travel down the brain stem or such and you would not be able to intercept them so trying to pick up the electrical signals created while dreaming is  impossible so out of the question and once again would be unreliable even if some how it could happen", 
      "Actually if u use this dream thing u just need to use cerebral cortex  and use the messages that are sent by electromagnetic waves the brain sends, and if this works it will have abit of problems. One of them is that it would interfere with the feelings of the mind and u might change greatly by messing with their self concise  and their personality so I’d rather more steer away from that it may mess up badly.", 
      "We just need the technology they had in Inception.", 
      "why dont you some what combine them and keep the human body “awake” enough  for the breathing to be at a minimal while also dulling the human impulses as breathing takes no thought and breathes automatically unless told by the brain to stop and how you cant choke yourself to death your body and brain wont let you but here its your heart that does the work so if you just keep the brain dulling out of it it may work but if you do people wont walk around while playing the game so lets get to it guys!!", 
      "in essence a full body coma without harming the brain in any way shape or form, thats the conclusion i’ve come to. to the part of brain waves and patterns it would be easy enough to create a head gear similar to nerve gear with a scanner that hovers above your spine reading all the nerve patterns and signals and sending them into the game, I do agree with you that dulling the signals down say with an inhibitor for the muscles only would indeed work.", 
      "“when you dream all of the movement impulses are in you brain they don’t travel down the brain stem or such and you would not be able to intercept them so trying to pick up the electrical signals created while dreaming is impossible so out of the question and once again would be unreliable even if some how it could happen”", 
      "this is a comment i made regarding trying to  use a dream its the same concept as this coma idea", 
      "but for example a scanner hovering over your spine you’d be on your back that would be a bit bothersome would it not and quite expensive", 
      "You don’t need to breath in a virtual world, so that signal doesn’t need to be redirected", 
      "You won’t need to mess with the brain just the nucleus", 
      "…Look up what a Nucleus is, please.", 
      "Dumbass…", 
      "the only problem is is that you cant really dull impulses or anything else without doing something to interrupt the entire transmission which at this point it would be easier to just redirect completely and if you dull them how then would you move the human analog in the game?", 
      "Or you can do sleep paralysis. You do it every night so you don’t do things irl that you do in you dream.", 
      "u seem like u know a lot.lol XD", 
      "Thats why you use nucleus cells from yourself in your skin its not harmful unless you consider 1 skin cell gone harmful. Not trying to be rude just trying to inform ^-^", 
      "ok i not sure if you read textbooks but a nucleus is the heart of a plant cell", 
      "all cells look it up da", 
      "Soooo sounds like you’ve got this down", 
      "Lol, i mean, the occulus rift (however you spell thatXD) has a good idea, but like with the galaxy s4′s eye tracking, so you don’t have to scroll, if that was in by the screen for some screen turning action, then we’ve got ourselves another step!", 
      "the only thing is its not a true step towards VR as we think of it. it makes more people think of VR to be just that not something like sao. but it dose start to get Vr across the field of gaming which is helpful but again not same idea as sao", 
      "I think that has already been done with something, though I don’t remember what…", 
      "When we sleep/dream, our brains disconnect from the motor systems in the body.  If one could emulate that process, you could have people dream in a shared simulation.  A little like inception.", 
      "that’s very true but keeping that severed connection stable and un harmful would be the only problem because while we sleep we are mind is still connected to the motor functions but doesn’t send many impulses it would be hard to keep a constant level of disconnection without harming either one and it becomes very easy to awake so to speak.", 
      "Frankly, I’m amazed that people have got some legitimate theories…also, while the actual hardware would take immense funding and the device would have to be tested a hell of a lot. The coding aspect is also important – how would you connect a brain ( conscience included) to a server. There would be problems if a powercut cut the server- or someone hacked it. People ( possibly, I’m snatching a straws) could have their brains put into a coma…?", 
      "I think that if they went with the signal being sent to and from the server/brain via whatever transmitting device, then a sudden cut in power would result in it simply shutting down and the person waking up.", 
      "Perhaps said transmission device could include a safety feature that automatically gets the person out if it loses the connection? And its circuitry could be designed to break if it is made to go beyond a certain limit, to protect from comas (that’s how fuses work.)", 
      "…Truth be told, I’m coming up with this from scratch, though. XD", 
      "also a battery that can keep it on during emergency log-out", 
      "That actually sounds like a good idea.", 
      "Dude, I’ve been thinking about the same theory for about a week. I generally think it could work, and I’m curious, would you maybe wanna talk about it? I would LOVE to see the Nervegear and the world of SAO in real life.", 
      "With the death?", 
      "Well, there’s a lot of smart people on Earth. I’m sure somebody knows xD", 
      "actually no because during rim sleep your body secretes a hormone that paralysis the body and he could just use the helmet to manipulate the brain to secrete this while only intercepting the pain and movement signals from the brain but yes you would to have a very in depth knowledge of neurology and bio-engineering and be able to program with the best", 
      "The day that someone figures out how to transfer ones consciousness to a game will be the day that the world ends (transferring terrorist’s consciousness to robot with explosives on board)", 
      "Someone has actually successfully made a working “Cortana” like from Halo.  It only lasted for a few minutes, though, until it killed him…  looks like we still have a lot to learn", 
      "actually it’s no difference between skyrim and here, just the modding would be optional. They sayed it’s like microwave signal’s. Correct right? It’s easier to cooperate with company’s that you have ally’s in. Funding would be a lot easier.Who wouldn’t want to have something to claim rewards to? especially something of this magnitude. But not everyone needs the mirror part of the game", 
      "It would be just like sleeping if you think about it. All you’d need is a way for the headset to put the body to sleep while keeping the mind awake. Not as hard as it sounds considering we do that on a daily basis as part of a natural process. If one were to work very hard, SAO is completely possible.", 
      "Oh and the whole “finding a way to keep breathing” thing. Why would you need something to keep your body breathing? The only way your body will stop breathing completely is if something is crammed down your throat, or you have a disorder/disease preventing you from breathing. No developer in there right mind would make something that would interrupt the breathing cycle. If you try to stop breathing, you pass out, and start breathing automatically.", 
      "If that was invented the price are 1m or 2m or higher", 
      "It would be badass though and if done people would worship him as god.", 
      "Honestly it might be easier than we’d expect, go look up REM sleep and the waves that the brain sends out to put you in a full paralysis every night!", 
      "We’ve also already managed to not only connect a camrea to the visual cortex so that the person can regain sight (even a blind man got to see for the first time), we’ve also already controlled robot arms with just our thoughts so it should definitely be possible to control a virtual avatar using the same method.", 
      "my friend the world will be in your debt if  it works!", 
      "hey i would be happy to fund you also but im creating a software just like this im am so close i just cant figure out a few algorithms but the full dive process is so close to being produced we just need about 1 million more US dollars to complete the project i have a huge donor already lined up for it and am hoping the process will be completed i already have a patent on my work but i would be happy to have someone else who can help with it. if you want email me back on this email and ill have one of my assistants talk to you about this.", 
      "I could help alot I hope you are serious. cmattingly28(at)gmail.com", 
      "Which patent? I’d like to look into it.", 
      "so you expect us to give you 500000000$ and say yes to it? let me just sum that up for u hell no!", 
      "Hey man I wanna be a beta tester…lol. seriously though man", 
      "I want to be like kirito a beta cheater", 
      "do you mean a beater", 
      "Same here man", 
      "who doesn’t", 
      "Focus on connecting the advanced nucleus cells located in of your brain to a new type of piece of a cell. The trick is to develop something that the advanced nucleus absorbs so it can pass to the five senses and tricks them into seeing the projections into the new type of piece of a cell. that’s all my studies have gotten me to so far see if you can get any further ^-^. If you find out anything more please tell me I am friends with a game developer who works for Microsoft. Email me at cmattingly28(at)gmail.com", 
      "Guys here is how to control your character and you can use an occulos rift for sight  now you just need something that can trick your mind into thinking that it’s feeling something or tasting or even smelling and you might be able to do that by sending impulses to your brain just an idea and I know it’s not complete VR but it’s pretty stinking close ^_^", 
      "I would too as long as I get to be a beta tester (;", 
      "It’d be kinda boring to be an Admin, you can have anything in the game just by using the main menu.", 
      "I’d be glad to fund it. Anything to make my dreams into reality…", 
      "It’s possible to use sensors to pick up the electrical signals transmitted from the spine. Take as an example: The sensors placed on an actual moving person so you can register what signals move what muscles. Then you’ve more or less turned the helmet into a controller. Added bonus, also look into the senses of the body. Smell, touch ect. Did you know devices that can produce hundreds of different scents exist? You can give a player the sensation of being in a field of flowers or even on the battle field with special pads with controlled air pouches. When the person is shot in the midst of battle motors push and pull air out of the pads giving the feeling of being shot (without the pain obviously). In a previous comment I made, I mention REM state (Rapid Eye Movement) it’s a state of deep sleep in which the voluntary muscles are paralyzed so that the person dreaming doesn’t act out their dreams physically. It’s natures way of keeping you from falling out of the tree at night if you will. Avoiding the big words, there are two things that have to be activated to cause the voluntary muscle paralysis. =^-^=",

      "I will donate my body for testing, it may go horribly wrong and kill me but I may also be the first person to test real truly immersive virtual reality… I will take that risk!!", 
      "Instead of dying in the game, why not delete the character? Once you died in the game, you need to do it all over again with a new character.", 
      "What if you just lose about 10% of your money and respawn in your home. If you die before you have enoughe to buy a house back to begining spawn.", 
      "drop items that aren’t marked as your favorites and when you die spawn in closest city or village we should have some type of spawn stone or cyrstel respawn there. do wea get telport cyrstel like in the sao",

      "lol me and you both", 
      "You better… ._.", 
      "Anyone else cringe at when people like this one say “I will donate, but you better give me the game for free”? That is not donating, that is just lending. Wth the fact that at least most of you say that probably will donate nothing near enough to cover a full-game’s cost for it, so in the end you are just a big fat and ugly burden to creator(s). All you are doing is being selfish and arrogantly assuming you should get a free game because you tossed chump change in comparison to the amount of money needed to make this. The only thing you should get for being a single individual for donating money is some nice rare-ish item that is flashy and will be ultimately useless other than a money-spent trophy before even mid-game and/or some kinda thank you in the credits that no-one really reads nor will be that impressed. Donations aren’t for you to barely speed up the process and then get granted the ultimate reward of a full game. It should be for you to speed up the process so that you can hurry up and BUY the game. Donations are for the process, buying it is to thank the creators for the excellent game.  Which is why you should only be awarded with something that will eventually be usless, because with donating you are already helping yourself, to get closer to incredible game. When you donate to charity, for example let’s sayyyyy cancer, you don’t have them keep a vial of the cure in case you develop it, you freaking helped mankind, that should be enough, right? Now I should aslo tell you to never post  your own PRIVATE (so busniess emails obviously should not keep one of their means of communication private) email up on the internet to where anyone who was not meant to see it can see it. Forums, comment sections, anything of the such. Emails are probably your least-dangerous of your unique information you can give away, but is still bad to be seen by the wrong people. I could go ahead and snab your email adress and sell it to sleazy businesses for a quick buck, allowing them to target you and do whatever they aim to. But I won’t because that is stupid, and anyone who sells people’s private information are also stupid. I think I said everything I needed to.",

      "it better be a world wide game", 
      "I would think other servers for other countries",

If someone donates a certain high amount, or if they actually make a contribution other than money that will support the production of either the game or the technology of the console (for example, beneficial research, a produced model, coding, help with game development) if they provide a contribution as valuable as one of these then they are allowed to beta test free",

      "I hope so",

      "To all the fools saying you’d need to be in a paralysis state is wrong you could be just asleep and have the nerve gear actually interfere with the brain signals thus stopping movement while in game and it should read the signal like lets say you brain send a signal to the nerves in your arm to move the nerve gear will get it signal before those nerves and move the signal to the game so you move in there.Now this could work with adding chips in your spine and it really depends how fast the nerve gear is to catch those brain signals and transfer them in the game so in the next ten years it would be possible.

      "The NerveGear is a helmet with a smooth, deep blue color. At the back, it has a wire of the same color stretched out of a long pad. It also has a battery and internal memory to store data from the games, which is how Kirito stored Yui in it. 30% of the NerveGear’s weight is from its internal battery. The NerveGear’s high density microwave transceivers can determine what the user’s face looks like. The transceivers not only block every transmission from the brain to the body, but also from the body to the brain; while using it, the player is completely insensate to the physical world. Unknown to anyone except for Kayaba prior to the opening of Sword Art Online, the NerveGear’s transceivers possess enough power to fry the player’s brain with a burst of microwaves, using the power from its internal battery, and SAO’s operating system has been programmed to do so if the player’s hit points are reduced to zero.",

Anyone out here remember when we were kids and Walmart started selling virtual reality games where you fought ninjas and such. Very similar. You have the helmet, air pads, a system similar to AromaRama, a flat top-rounded bottom treadmill base, and obviously the position sensors (like what the wii and such have).

With the Nerve Gear, a virtual reality helmet that stimulates the user’s five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds.", 
      "On November 6, 2022, the players log into SAO for the first time, and later discover that they are unable to log out. They are then informed by Akihiko Kayaba, SAO’s creator, that if they wish to be free, they must reach the 100th floor of the game’s tower and defeat the final boss. However, if their avatars die in-game, their bodies will also die in the real world. One of these players is Kazuto “Kirito” Kirigaya, who was chosen as one of the 1,000 beta testers in the closed beta. Since he had previous experience and knowledge of the game, he felt that he could beat the game easily. As a result, he set out to beat the game on his own. As the game progresses for two years, Kirito eventually befriends a female player named Asuna with whom he ultimately falls in love. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba’s avatar in SAO, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.", 
      "Upon being sent back to the real world, Kirito learns that Asuna and 300 other SAO players have still not awakened yet. Following a clue about Asuna’s whereabouts in another VRMMORPG called Alfheim Online (ALO), Kirito also enters the ALO’s mainframe. Helped by his sister Suguha Kirigaya, known as Leafa in the game, he learns that the trapped players in ALO are part of a plan conceived by Nobuyuki Sugō to perform illegal experiments on their minds to put them under his control, including Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world in order to take over her family’s company. After Kirito foils Nobuyuki’s plans, he finally reunites with Asuna back in the real world.", 
      "Soon after, Kirito plays another game called Gun Gale Online (GGO) to investigate the mysterious connection between it and deaths occurring in the real world. Assisted by a female player he meets in the game called Sinon, he identifies and exposes the culprits, who include some former members of a murderous guild he had previously encountered in SAO.", 
      "Kirito is later recruited to assist in testing a state-of-the-art FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface that is far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played. He tests the STL by entering a Virtual Reality world created with The Seed package, named UnderWorld (UW). In the UW mainframe, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito’s memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, he ends up falling into a trap set by one of the murderers from GGO and wakes up inside UnderWorld without any recollection of how he ended up there, unable to log out, with his real self left in a comatose state.",

Like, use the Oculus Rift and, instead of using a controller to walk, attack and do other actions, use sensor gloves or something. Or, just a helmet, like the Oculus Rift, that connects to your brain somehow. Ok, think of the Mind Flex game, you use your mind to move the ball, well, the fan….but still, you have to think about the ball going up or down for it to move. Take the thought sensors of the Mind Flex headband, you may need to upgrade them in some scientific way, (I wouldn`t know how to do any of this stuff) the Oculus Rift headset, a mic, like an Xbox One mic or PS3 mic, put them all together, and you have the NerveGear headset from Sword Art Online.",

Instead of big centralized sites like OCRemix and VGMix, the Japanese community is focused mainly on solo albums and occasional large group collaborations. That they cost money does not mean that all doujins feature great work. Another problem is that since there are no central remixing hubs, doujin selling and personal remix hosting is often done on tons of tiny websites, which often go down or disappear with time. Where we could find an order page, the Chrono Compendium has listed where one can acquire doujins for each entry.

The project was started way back in January of 2005, with the intent of covering the entire Chrono Trigger soundtrack on piano. The project was an attempt to gather amateur recording artists to produce a full scale album during the video game piano craze at the time. Later on, the project hard drive suffered a crash and nearly all of the tracks were lost. By then, many of the pianists had dispersed so reaching them for songs was out of the question. Since then, I had planned to continue the project, but it seems as if the video game piano fan base is not what it once was. Below you will find a link to what is left of the project. I would personally like to thank everyone who has remained interested in this project over the last few years.

      "Tsuyoshi Sekito is a senior composer, arranger, and guitarist at Square Enix best known for his work with The Black Mages. Born on April 3, 1963 in Osaka, Sekito developed a passion for music while at high school. Utterly obsessed with guitars, Sekito’s favourite artists are those that use the instrument principally, including Van Halen and Dream Theater. Though inclined towards uptempo West coast American rock, most music that uses guitars prominently appeals to him. Though Sekito considers himself a good example of an instrumental rock performer, he regrettably feels he lacks the ’rock n’ roll’ spirit of his idols — middle-aged, conscientious, and shy. After graduating from high school, he pursued further musical activities and foreign language studies at the Kansai Gaidai University. Desiring to create music professionally, he noticed that Konami were recruiting composers after a string of arcade successes. After submitting a demo tape, he joined their Osaka branch as a part-time employee in April 1986, shortly after graduating."

      "With Hamauzu's versatility being somewhat undermined by the presence of the  theme, the lighter tracks often prove among the shallower additions, some  exceptions aside. Certainly, one of the soundtrack's major flaws is that far too  many of the light-hearted themes are carried by their melodies, and it is only  really the darker themes that have any substance or musical assets. The  laid-back \"Chocobo's House\" is a prime example of a typical light-hearted track;  with the theme being in a waltz time, a swaying melody plays against a bare  xylophone accompaniment that offers no supporting features other than its  rhythm. Indeed, tracks like these are disappointing, and when compared with the  likes of the ominous \"Let's Go Underground,\" it is easy to see which has more  depth. On top of this, only a handful of themes are exceptions, meaning Hamauzu  doesn't often learn from his mistakes, which seems disappointing when there is  so much evidence of his creativity elsewhere. That said, it is all too easy to  concentrate on the limitations of such themes, and, since quite a few listeners  will enjoy the cheeky atmosphere created by the majority of Hamauzu's  light-hearted tracks and it is undeniable that they suit the game effectively,  the chances are that quite a bit can be overlooked. Indeed, tracks like \"Scythe  Man is Coming\" demonstrate Hamauzu's ability to create melodic and enjoyable,  yet highly intricate and original, themes, while the relaxing \"Store Man\" is  also notable in that it demonstrates one of Hamauzu's fingerprints, distinctive  piano use in conjunction with wider forces. one of Hamauzu's fingerprints. The  dominance of themes written in the 'melody with accompaniment' format in its  most baneful form quickly grows tiresome in places, though Hamauzu's sprinkles  of creativity and the fact it fits the game doesn't damage the composer's  largely spotless career too much; still, a fitting score would have been  possible without some of the light-hearted Chocobo drivel.", 
      "Nonetheless, the experience gets better when Hamauzu's more serious themes  take over, with these themes offering far more than just a simple melody.  Indeed, along with the 'darker' themes, such themes include the battle,  mystical, and militaristic themes. His mystical tracks, like \"In Search for the  Illusionary Item\" and \"World of Darkness,\" seem to be one of Hamauzu's strong  points on this album; with it becoming easy to see that he concentrated on  developing the bass line here, it is also clear that the atmospheres created are  far more clear and intriguing. Not only this, but the timbre and texture is also  improved, often showing Impressionistic influences; this is especially evident  in \"Wooden Room,\" in which bells, strings, a harp, and many other instruments  all feature. Further, Hamauzu makes sure that the listener is exposed to the  most suitable atmospheres he can create, keeping them entertained by making each  piece have an individual feel, avoiding most clichês altogether. Action themes  provide further evidence that Hamauzu rarely fails in an action-based setting.  \"Challenge\" has one of the best development sections on the album, and, with the  bass line driving the whole theme, the melody is free to glide and lure the  listener into the depths of action. The final boss theme, \"Fight, Chocobo!\", is  no exception, and, although it doesn't develop as much as it could do, the  overall effect is a successful one, paying homage to many modernist composers.  Each of these themes are a great step up from his light-hearted tracks, so it  just goes to show what a bit of atmosphere can do. As for militarism, the march  \"Atora's Theme\" delights with its buoyant rhythms and light yet meaningful  melodies.", 
      "Out of all of the themes on this album, there are four that can't be missed,  and I am sure that you won't be surprised to learn that they are all  orchestrated and were originally performed live. The aforementioned \"Prelude  (orchestrated)\" is the first, already discussed quite considerably, while it  requires the listener to go straight to other end of the soundtrack to  experience the second, \"Finale,\" perhaps the principle highlight of February  2006's rerelease. It starts off in a cunning fashion with many areas suggesting  a forthcoming development, and, indeed, after a brief pause, the track really  gets moving, demonstrating a huge amount of sophistication, despite still being  very melodic and light-hearted. The soundtrack needed more tracks like this  overall, even if a full-orchestration would not be feasible for a PlayStation  game. The other two themes are held on the bonus 8cm disc, which, rather  unfortunately, was only a limited edition release. The jingling bells of  \"Chocobo's Happy Christmas,\" combined with its quaint orchestration, makes it  yet another delightful Christmassy arrangement of the Chocobo theme, but it is  the hidden organ part that is most admirable, since it ends the track with a  sense of dominance, despite being unheard throughout the first few minutes.  Currently available at Square Enix's iTune's store, those who haven't heard it  would be advised to consider purchasing it for a few pennies. Unfortunately, the  upbeat \"C/W: Dreams on Wings\" is impossible to legitimately obtain, though is  the worst of the four themes, less creative and highly predictable. Though it  was a nice bonus to the initial soundtrack, do not be too depressed by its  current lack of availability."

      "The Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra performs on the soundtrack.", 
      "For this piece, I had a marching tempo demo version, but it sounded too cheerful and it was rejected (the only piece rejected for this project), as the team wanted to renew the image of FF and I was yet to grasp the game's outlook. 10 months passed and we were at almost the end of development...it was then that I remembered another slow tempo version that I had previously written and I thought it would be the perfect match. So, I made a quick adjustment without touching the chord and sub-melodies, and it was perfect! I suppose my initial inspiration wasn't too off (laugh). Afterward, I hurried and arranged another piece which is now played in key scenes.", 
      "Just like \"Prelude\", I was feeling my way around as I wrote this piece since the world of FF was yet to be revealed. I had about four demos and by incorporating ideas from Mr Toriyama (the Director), I made one arrangement to another to form the piece. So I feel that Mr Toriyama and I wrote this together. At the end, we asked Mr. Toshiyuki Omori to turn it into orchestrated piece by adding harp to the intro piano part and also changing the outro sound from synthesizer to strings. He actually said that the synthesizer wasn't bad at all, but it was the first one to be played in the demo version and I insisted on the live instruments.", 
      "This is derived from the earlier version of \"Blinded By Light\", which was the first FF13 piece I wrote for E3 back in 2006. The original plan was to create a B-melody by evolving the E3 \"Blinded By Light\", but I ended up not adding anything, because I didn't think it was ideal for battle music to take a long time to get to the climax. But I had this B-melody stuck in my head and wanted to use it somewhere... so part of it is incorporated in this piece.", 
      "I laid a live orchestra over a programmed orchestral piece that was almost completed. I've used quite a bit of this \"lay-over\" technique for this project, but because this style is rarely done, it wasn't easy for us to reach the recording stage. Some of the percussion was programmed, but for majority of the instruments I had an arranger who would orchestrate them or adjust the scoring. By mixing the expressive live sound and the large scale programmed orchestral sound, I could match the grand world of FF. When I was making demos, people often said that the programmed elements were good enough because I made them in great detail. In hindsight, I think the combination of live and programmed sounds worked quite well.", 
      "It's the piece we played live at a game event in 2008. As I was given the direction to use \"hybrid music\" for FF13, \"Blinded By Light\" was a consolidated piece of violin solo, guitar and orchestra (and more), while this one is based on strings, piano and synthesizer. For a hybrid piece, it seems like the live feel of it is too overwhelming given the arrangement and number of the tracks. However, by adding a minimal mood, it comes closer to the synthesizer side, which I think creates a good balance For these minimal 8 minute string and 16 minute piano pieces, I kept the rough sound of the initial random play and developed from there. The delayed \"whang!\" of the piano sound just before the loop is used from time to time, which could almost give the impression of it \"almost not being able to catch up with the tempo\", but it's all intentional. This is my favorite part (laugh).", 
      "The backing chorus is actually a recording of my daughter Aya's voice. I had her sing for a demo, but I ended up using it. Since I was told that FF13 has various dark scenes especially in the beginning of the game, I wanted to create a mood of light tension here. By writing using conventional minor sounds, it would sound tacky and too heavy, so I deliberately tried to use chords which could sound neither major nor minor.", 
      "I recorded the MIDI sounds whilst I watched the relevant scene in the game being played out, so it was a real-time process. There were moments, as the piece was coming together and the movie was reaching its climax, that I was so moved I was almost trembling...(laugh). At 0:57, I intentionally set the chord like that. That's the kind of thing I like...", 
      "This track is using all programmed sounds except the violin solo. By adding just one acoustic violin, it reduces the \"wow factor\" significantly. I really enjoy work like this. It was originally a 90 second piece, but just before the recording, I thought the loop was too fast for a field track, so I quickly wrote the development part.", 
      "All summoned creatures in FF13 are cool which made me really excited creating a tune for them! I originally thought to mix orchestra, guitar and drums in one piece and then cut out any unnecessary parts, however it turned out to be quite interesting and well-balanced, so I decided to use it as is. I especially like the \"pounded out string\" sound which looks like it's ignoring the basic tune when it comes back to the introduction. Mr. Saito finally added some acoustic guitar, then it was completed. We have many ace guitarists in the SQUARE ENIX Sound Division!", 
      "This tune is the first piece, created for E3 in 2006 when we revealed FF13. I remember that I worked hard on this piece in order not to let people down. I tried to create something which can deliver the sense of the game and have a catchy melody without being too straightforward... then finally, ensure to repeat the highlight part of the music.", 
      "The main melody and chords came to mind almost instantly, but I rearranged it many times. Originally the main melody phrase was 4/4 bars, but it seemed too repetitive even for chords and backing, so I decided to have 3/4 bars in order to add some things. On top of this, I asked Mr. Yamazaki to add a taste of rock music to it, and I don't think we could add such a sense of speed without him... I am so proud of my best buddy! I rearranged it so many times after that, but I could still not create something definite. When I brought a tune burnt on CD back home, my little daughter came to me saying \"you should add a flute sound to it,\" thinking there were high tones missing in the tune that I created. Since then, I added a soft violin tone with an octave high to it and then it sounded like it worked perfectly. Also, I was originally considering adding a B-melody for further development to it, but thinking that gamers play hundreds and thousands of battles, I came to the decision it would be simpler to go straight into the climatic part. After all these twists and turns \"Blinded By Light\" was born."

      "This edition, technically the Second Edition (though I don’t think the rules were labeled as such, back when I didn’t think there would be any other editions) was printed on card stock that you could, in the right light, see through.  The second and third editions used the same box from the lot of 2000 I printed. The fourth edition print run, I upgraded the card stock so you couldn’t see through it in any sort of light. The 3rd edition rules were on a light yellowish paper with printing that looks like dot-matrix printing. The inside back of the rules say nothing about the edition number. I also printed part of the fourth edition with the same paper, so in fact the 4th ed has two different rule printings (the second by Chessex). The 4th edition actually says “4th edition” in the rules.", 
      "During this period, I also created the 1st Expansion Set in 1988 (and 1991), and the 2nd Expansion in 1993. Both in zip-locks, both with cheesy art by yours truly. If I remember right, neither of these had die-cut tokens. To save money, I left it to the buyer and his scissors, since both expansions were fairly small print runs (about 500 copies) and I couldn’t absorb the cost of a die.", 
      "In addition, I started adhering the token/board sheets for the expansions to chipboard using cans of 3M’s Super 77 spray adhesive. In my garage. So for those of you out there who have used this stuff, it freaking sticks to everything. After a very short while, finding that an aerosol glue will make every surface tacky within about 20 feet of where it’s being sprayed, I made a box out of cardboard with a clear plastic lid and a hole for my arm to fit through. A little pedestal in the middle of the box supported the chipboard I was spraying, and a little cardboard flap let me take the boards in and out. If you can imagine it, the layers of glue built up inside this little toxic spray booth that was about 2” thick. After a session of spraying, my excessively hirsute arm would come out with a white coat of glue on it (didn’t occur to me to wear disposable gloves – if they existed back then). That was a pleasure to get off. I have no idea how badly this screwed up my lungs, though judging by the lack of tacky surfaces in the garage, I was successful in my efforts to isolate the scourge of airborne adhesive.", 
      "I must have used a case of that spray-glue:", 
      "End of advertisement. Probably bad for the environment anyway.", 
      "Chessex printed essentially the same version for the 5th edition. About 2000 copies, I think. They put on the cover “New 1991 Fifth Edition” so it’s one of the easiest to identify. And the back was actually a printed box! I was still selling the expansions myself at this time.", 
      "The 6th or 7th edition (I don’t remember which) had a little problem; Chessex had had them manufactured in Mexico, and 1 out of 12 copies (roughly) had miscounted cards and fingerprints on some of them. I ended up making a guarantee to folks to send them whatever replacement cards they needed, and actually bought quite a few copies from Chessex, opened them up, checked the decks, and resealed everything so I could sell them with confidence. It was an aggravating period.", 
      "I still send out replacement parts on occasion (no charge), if I still have them. There are a lot of old bits and pieces from prior editions taking up space in the garage.", 
      "But, the OTHER difference between the two industries is this; we entered into the contract, I got my advance, and a few months later Codefire went out of business (not because of my advance, really). The rights for the game reverted back to me (something you should always have in your contracts!). Start-up video game companies, I found out, often have very short life expectancies.",

      "I really liked the article especially the part on Super 77 adhesive spray!", 
      "Thanks Tom! Great article. I always think art is better within context, and this makes me want to bust out WW again. At BGG Con in Dallas last year a man was flailing around the convention hall screaming Wizzzz Warrrrr and a new generation of players was born!", 
      "Regarding context, I can’t believe I left out what my original inspiration was; I had recently started playing D&D and The Fantasy Trip, and wanted to distill out the magic part of the game since that was the part I enjoyed the most. And, of course, there’s the interview where Garfield says that Wiz-War and Cosmic Encounters were two of *his* inspirations.", 
      "Very interesting that you were also inspired by an aspect of D&D – in the same way that Peter (Terence) Donnelly created his game “The Sorcerer’s Cave” to incorporate the aspects of “encounters in an underground lair”.  I wonder how many game designers, if asked, would put up their hand for the same reason  Massive debt owed to Gary Gygax, I think!", 
      "I think three years ago at KublaCon in Burlingame, CA, someone had a version of the game where they had taken 4 tarps, and made “Life-size” Wiz-War.  Each square was about 18″ on a side.  It used a pre-FFG edition of the cards, I recall.  It was quite awesome!", 
      "Thanks for many many years of fun games!", 
      "Great article! I remember playing Wiz-War for the first time at Slug-A-Thon ’89, who knew I was in the shadow of gaming history! I also recall playing a life size at DunDraCon, got to throw a squishy ball at someone for the Fireball spell.", 
      "I consider the challenges that your labor of love had to overcome to become the hit that it is, and it makes me wonder; with the ease the information age permits a game to be designed have we lost the ‘natural selection’ a game needs to ensure it is great?", 
      "Kickstarter surely evinces that perhaps making a game is now too easy. Flashy graphics, familiar mechanics, a safe theme (say Cthulhu) and you are likely to fund. Not so easy for Wiz-War, and the game is better for it.", 
      "Thank you Tom for decades of fun. When you are ready to host the life size at KublaCon let me know. I will bring my own Rock.", 
      "Hi, Brandon. I think the natural selection process in game design is stronger than ever. New game design ideas keep getting introduced all the time (mutations!) and get incorporated into better and better games. Games today have so much better balance and mechanics and graphics than the games I played as a kid, the transition over the last 50 years is absolutely astounding to me. The ease with which an idea can enter the market just means there’s that many more mutations that the designer can select from (though it also tends to mean a smaller market share, and greater difficulty achieving any sort of recognition…sort of like a telepathic cave newt).", 
      "Elaboration on my dealings with FFG: they do send me cards and rules for comments, and I do make a lot of comments, to which they give due attention. We work well together. When I sold the game to them, the sale went with 3 expansion sets and about 350 spell cards in total. While they are designing a lot of new cards and ideas without my help, I like to think that the originals cards have been mined well for ideas driving some of the new designs. Much of the new material they’ve created is, in my opinion, quite spectacular.", 
      "I love seeing historical pieces like this (Tom, I bet you never thought someone was going to use a phrase like that about you). It’s great to see an idea from it’s inception, through multiple iterations and then to see its current incarnation.", 
      "Thanks for sharing.", 
      "Fantastic insight into a great game and truly a labour of love.", 
      "How did it feel to finally get your hands on the ‘deluxe’ version released by FFG? After many hours of manual labour you committed to making your dream a reality, I can’t imagine what it would’ve felt like to hold the FFG version in your hands (as we all know, the production quality of FFG is of amazingly high standard).", 
      "P.S I was a board gamer as a child (simple games such as the usual monopoly, mouse trap, trouble etc) and fell out of interest with the hobby in my teens when videogames took over (mid 90s… There was no boardgame scene that I knew of at the time here in Aus). Two years ago I decided to walk into a board game store to buy my cousin a Christmas gift with a difference… Something we could play together that wasn’t a videogame. That game was Wiz-War (FFG edition) and it has since sparked a boardgame obsession of mine bordering on the unhealthy. Thank you for that Tom.", 
      "I’m always happy to contribute to someone’s unhealthy board game obsession.", 
      "I was pretty excited to see the final product. Oddly, the first time I saw it was because someone (I don’t remember who) emailed me about a video (online) at FFG’s booth at Gencon that had a display case in the background with a promotional copy of Wiz-War in it. Just a peek! But it was great to get the physical copy in my hands many months later, especially since it had been out of print for nearly 12 years. FFG has awesome production values.", 
      "I really love this game, even though i only have the FF edition it is always the first one my game group goes for when we sit down for a day of board games. Great work and interesting story.", 
      "Keep making great games sir!"

AH did a few reprints -- Diplomacy and Acquire -- but those have an existing fan base and broad appeal compared to niche games like Mystic Wood and Magic Realm.

      "Mystic Wood, Wizards, and Knights of Camelot were all on the hobby store shelf when I took \"grandma money\" from my 13th birthday and chose the Holmes basic D&D because it looked cooler.

The overworld theme is another high point: While beginning quite simply, every additional party member also adds another voice, leading to a heroic piece of music in the later stages of a generation.

      "If ever Sega truly defined itself as a console-creating entity in its own right, however, that shining moment of glory came in the 16-bit era courtesy of the Genesis. Unlike Sony and Nintendo, Sega never enjoyed a dominant market share in every major region (Japan, the U.S., and Europe) simultaneously. But Genesis came close. Had its Japanese version, the Mega Drive, been able to loosen Nintendo’s grip on its home territory, the company would have dominated the 16-bit market—at least for a little while.", 
      "Ultimately, though, the secret of Genesis’ American triumph had more to do with a single key business decision: For the first time ever, a parent company looked to the prospects of its game hardware in a foreign market and told its overseas branch, “You know what? You guys understand this market better than we ever will. Do what you need to.”", 
      "Yet Kalinske rightly gauged the U.S. market, and Genesis quickly became a sensation. In the early days, it offered remarkable audio/visual power at a compelling price. Before long, it also offered well-made software by Western developers, who had been sorely under-represented on Nintendo’s NES. Once the Super NES finally launched in 1991, the Genesis took it head-on: Sega offered a more robust library of software that seemed refreshingly free of the sluggishness and slowdown that plagued so much early SNES software.", 
      "And so it went, a chess match of move and countermove. Super NES made its inroads in the U.S. market to be sure, but Nintendo found the 16-bit era a painful challenge in the world’s largest (at the time) console games market, especially after the cakewalk the NES enjoyed. Ultimately, Nintendo had to pull out all the stops: Special add-on chips, sophisticated middleware tools to fake next-gen graphics, and ultimately even trying in its own nebbish way to mimic Sega’s confrontational advertising style.", 
      "In the end, the Super NES’s eventual market share lead came in at a razor-thin majority and likely had as much to do with Sega’s own internal friction as any clever tactics by Nintendo itself. The massive success of Genesis in the West, on the West’s own terms, didn’t inspire Sega’s leadership to further explore that style of autonomy; on the contrary, but most accounts it fostered a sense of jealousy and resentment within the Japanese management and allowed a rift between the two divisions of the company to form. The two branches began working in opposition rather than unison, with Japan placing ever greater pressure on the U.S. division to do things their way.", 
      "This fractious relationship began to wear at Sega’s coherency, which probably explains why they thought releasing 32-bit add-on 32X a year before the 32-bit Saturn’s launch made any kind of sense. It would find its ultimate manifestation in the dual development pipelines for the Dreamcast, which saw both the Japanese and U.S. offices  designing completely different machines and Japan going with its own specs despite the alleged superiority of the American design.", 
      "But that’s a story for another time. The Genesis years, brief as they ultimately proved to be, represented Sega’s finest moment: The one time in its history where great software found itself matched by equally excellent hardware, suitably canny business sense, and much-deserved success in the marketplace.",

      "Okay, so the wacky enemies are pretty charming after all. Did I just get run over by a spherical cow? While dodging some moles with a startling resemblance to the future Mr. Resetti? And a bouncing sausage-moose that twists into nothingness when it dies? Ahead of some rocket-launcher toting wolves? Yeah, the enemy designs are fun. Speaking of those rocket-launching wolves, though…", 
      "After figuring out the controls and getting into the rhythm of the game I’m actually having fun, until it starts really kicking me in the teeth. Later levels are so filled with enemies and projectiles that staying alive at all becomes an exercise in frustration. That hefty-looking life bar doesn’t count for much when enemies can deplete it in four hits. Clearly there’s some quarter-munching motivation at work here, but pumping in infinite credits isn’t a terribly satisfying way to “win” a game.",

This update runs “on almost any OS”, fixes the few bugs that were present in Liero 1.33, and also adds a host of welcome features, such as post-game stats and an enjoyable new mode, called “Hold a Zone”, where players must claim and protect small sections of the map for a specified period of time.",

In Crawl, species matters a lot more than starting class, class just determines which skills and items you start with, but is non-binding because you can always learn other skills and find other items: so you can begin as an elven fighter but then find a spellbook and decide to focus on magic anyway. Your species determines how fast you can increase different skills (varying from -5 to +5 learning rates), your movement speed, body size, metabolism, whether you have horns or claws or other features, and so on. If you get into the game you’ll probably try out all the species at least once, but then stick with a few favorites.",

      "During play, the player will find a large arrangement of magic items. These range from potions to magical amulets. In true roguelike style, none of these items are identified from the get go. Identifying magical scrolls and potions is very simple, since you just have to use them. Afterwards you'll be able to identify any similar potion/scroll. However, playing guinea pig with yourself can be dangerous, since the game features a vast amount of malicious scrolls and potions. This however, makes it all the more important to quickly identify these items, so that they won't cause you trouble later. Weapons and armor can be enchanted. To identify these items, you can either use them for a prolonged amount of time, and eventually your character will figure out what they do, provided they aren't cursed, in which case you'll instantly know as you're unable to remove the item from your character until you use a remove curse scroll. Items can also be identified through the use of an identify scroll.", 
      "While exploring the dungeon, you'll soon amass a small treasury of gold coins, provided you don't suffer an exquisitely painful death at your own hands from unknowingly drinking poison first. Money can be spent in shops, which will typically be found on the lower levels of the dungeon. The shops inventories are randomly generated, but you can potentially purchase anything in shops.", 
      "Because a character increases in skills depending on how he uses them, classes do not play as a significant role in Crawl than they do in other games. Your character is in no way restricted to develop solely in the direction he starts out in. It is possible for a fighter to eventually learn magic, how fast he does this depends on his race and how frequently he uses magic items. Your class bestows you with your starting equipment, as well as your starting skills, meaning you will start with specific skill at a certain level depending on your class. The classes of Crawl are broken up into four major groups: Fighter classes (not to be confused with the actual fighter class), Stealth classes, Religious Classes, and Magic Classes. There are a large amount of hybrids between these types as well, such as the Stalker, which is a stealth class with a splash of poison magic, or the Chaos Knight which is fighter who worships an evil god to gain divine powers. Many of the classes may appear to be very similar, but each has its own unique possibilities.",

      "The Catamites is a guy who makes freeware games. If you've played at least one of his games, chances are you were inspired to seek out more, or maybe to create your own. The games of The Catamites are funny, surreal, boundary-pushing, and full of wonder over the possibilities of videogames and the worlds they can create. They often feature quirky dialogue, strange characters, handcrafted art (pen and paper, clay, dioramas, Legos), and a tendency to toy with game tropes and genre conventions. The Catamites is building one of the most exciting and original bodies of work in gaming.", 
      "Like a game design ninja, The Catamites emerges from the mists periodically to deliver a new game and send shockwaves through the community. There is little to no hype about his games before they are released, and he has seldom shared any insight into his development process. This is an author who is truly making games to please himself. But each release is a revelation and a new demonstration of what can be achieved with videogames that can't be replicated in any other medium.", 
      "The Catamites has rarely been interviewed, so I was ecstatic when he agreed to answer some questions for me.", 
      "Hello, and thank you so much for this opportunity! It's really an honor. First off, can you tell me a little bit about where you grew up? Were videogames a part of your childhood? What gaming experiences had the most impact on you?", 
      "I grew up in Inchicore which is a suburb of Dublin in Ireland, a nice place though quiet, but remember having the sensation pretty quickly that everything in the world happened in America (equivalently, JP) and that the only things that made it to these shores were like the 8th-generation bootleg derivative leavings of real culture and had been poorly replicated too many times to be anything but vague outlines. The blocky abstract little Gameboy sprites were my friend. I have lots of old memories but they're all pretty tedious.", 
      "I only realised it recently but a lot of the videogames I played were actually other people's, like friends, relatives, someone's absent older brother, a cousin who had to sit exams and had his SNES games passed out to younger relations, rental copies, this possibly also contributed to feeling of something being lost.", 
      "Why do you think you started making games? Is there a developer who has particularly inspired you?", 
      "When I was very young I drew a lot of comics with a friend which were all basically an attempt to replicate videogame experiences, lots of blocky little guys moving sideways across flat plains and shooting rayguns at each other. I'm still not sure why these ideas appealed to me.", 
      "My younger brother also used RPG Maker and I remember he got really into constructing secret rooms for a castle he'd made. If you clicked on a certain chair you'd be teleported to a little dungeon filled with angry skeletons moving randomly around and if they touched you you got teleported to the skeleton dimension and could talk to them and buy special skeleton weapons. The perfect videogame!!", 
      "What games do you like to play these days? What are your all-time favorites?", 
      "How is it you came to collaborate with J. Chastain and what was that process like?", 
      "I understand that a lot of people playing the game are hearing loud and continuous honking sounds from their toad. This is an error and can be fixed by restarting your computer. If problem persists please return toad to source factory.", 
      "You tend to work with handmade visuals. Whether Legos, paper cutouts, clay figures, drawings scanned in from a piece of paper, or even your digital art, the visual components of your games always feel handcrafted. Do you make things in any other mediums besides games? What other artistic mediums interest you and inspire you?", 
      "I don't make anything else, I kind of just like the juxtaposition aspect of videogames. Even in normal ones there's this emphasis on building a image of what's going on - in terms of game states, narrative, locations, etc - by comparing different discrete objects, like the difference between the \"GUI\" and the \"little guy moving around\" areas of the screen, maps, [SHOP] screens, text, external info, all kind of playing off each other. Self-contained little tiles repeated or broken up to denote different types of terrain. Old ASCII games with messages and dialogue that's also just concretely embodied in the level environment, etc. Doing anything directly with drawings or words or cardboard stuff makes me feel weird and cramped because there's a feeling you have to focus on the minutiae of each thing rather than just using the weird systemising aspects of videogames to give coherence to whatever garbage you throw in. Write HORSE on a piece of paper that has some four way walk system and it's a horse, write CORPSE FACTORY on a different piece and have your horse disappear when bumping into it and there's a little environment already. I do like music and books but I'm kind of overawed by them whereas with videogames who cares, make a horse simulator.", 
      "I feel like we are kind of at the start of a new renaissance of sorts in independent games. Are there any young developers doing work today that is inspiring for you?", 
      "Just following up on the new developer thing -- it's not that I'm resistant to influence or feel sniffy about videogames (or at least exciting free ones), it's more that I don't actually like playing videogames at all. My favourite ones are where you have to kinda build up and refresh your image of this startling little self-contained world from a handful of mystery scraps, but that's also why I like \"shitty\" or \"blank\" vidcons with minimal affect. Good ones unsettle me for some reason to do with levels of private emotional intensity being channeled thru these strange interaction structures, feeling yourself change as you engage with opaque structures. \"When you gaze into the void..\" - DarkNietzche87 but there's something in the way you engage with these things that gives me the willies and I guess it's why I always think of videogames as having this vague malevolent quality. Trying to understand the little world and being taken apart yrself in the process, it's not that I have any moralistic objections to this as it could be the most interesting thing about videogames, but I'm not equal to these bold new experiences.", 
      "I believe the freeware videogame scene was hungry to embrace the \"moe\" aesthetic in all forms and guises and this videogame came out at the exact right time to capitalise on this. Leg Horse was a HIT. I attribute all my terrific success to the essential purity of my soul.", 
      "I think it's popular because it kind of simulates what I remember about playing JRPGs without most of the horrible tedious shit that forms the actual experience of playing those games. There's the bare bones of a plot and little cartoon guys moving around and scraps of dialog that don't really mean anything but it all seems reasonably assured of itself and there's that accumulation system under it so you can just kind of drift through in a fugue and look at things and read jokes. I also stole several excellent songs for the soundtrack.", 
      "I generally end up feeling embarrassed about short things that I just build to amuse myself but it's like building things from paper and paint, the scrappiness of it all forms a corrective to my natural pedantry, and I enjoy the first feelings of throwing ideas around.", 
      "You've been working in Unity recently. What do you like about it? You going to stick with it for a while?", 
      "I like making 3D things but I dunno why, it's probably hurtful to the imagination or something, like how all the different ways of communicating info through videogames suddenly devolved into a choice between the stock 3RDPERSON / 1STPERSON camera and movement decisions on the consoles, with all the different types of content mediated through those. But I'm still kind of attracted to that idea and to sensations of moving little guys through 3D space.", 
      "I like the ambiguity of function of that stuff... With regular videogames most of the focus is still on \"having fun\" and so a lot of effort is put into making you like and engage with what's happening, through presentation and \"flow\" and careful dripfeeding of rewards and prizes, so they have this kind of needy, cringing, servile aspect that can feel very revolting and suffocating. Edutainment titles are like those overly-detailed German truck simulators, or the stock software that comes with your computer, things that kind of blur the line between videogames and neutral application programs with some other specialised function. For example many videogames have a linear nature that relies on concentrated and consistent effort while the edugames I have played were mainly bundles of unrelated minigames spread laterally around, demonstrating a laudable indifference to concepts of progress or accomplishment. The relentlessly artificial interests that they need to assume on the part of the player (\">Tell me more about these colourful mosaics\") also aids in the impression of highly specialised objects sitting slightly apart from human life and regarding it with wary indifference, like cows.", 
      "There are probably a lot of reasons to be wary of the kinda Reithian values embedded in this stuff but even then I find it more liberating than more pure entertainment, which demands that you not only do what it tells you but that you LIKE it at the same time. The Games4Schools website is officially no longer canon as I forgot the password some time ago.", 
      "I noticed that you added Twine to the Resources page on harmonyzone. I'd love to see a Twine game from you. Your writing is so unique and dialogue is such a big part of many of your games. Have you made anything with Twine?", 
      "I'm uncomfortable with the directness of text and prefer to communicate everything via funny cartoon animals. It's like the juxtaposition thing again of directly represented text vs text as component in some looser structure that gives me more wriggle room for getting things across, like having a little plastic shipwreck for your octopus to live in to mitigate the fear of being spied on by predators. I'm the octopus in this metaphor.", 
      "I wanted the site to be an autonomous IP to up the market resale value. It was purchased by prominent videogame developer in February for use in a viral multimedia campaign. I won't say who bought it but his name rhymes with \"fon blow\".", 
      "I'd rather not, they're all the kinds of things you look back on and feel gross about. Imagined projects draw on your own mental image at the time of who you are and what's worth doing and so they have a very low shelflife, it's like the famous cliche about seeing pictures of your old haircuts. Whereas things you've made have to incorporate some bit of reality just because you can't be too precious if you want to finish something so you have to disengage superego a bit.", 
      "Are there other unfinished (or finished but unreleased) Catamites games sitting on a hard drive somewhere?", 
      "Classified... Illegal information...", 
      "Do you currently have any games in development or is there anything on the horizon?", 
      "No.", 
      "The Catamites has achieved something of a legendary status among indie gamers and game developers. I've spoken with a number of developers who cite you as a direct inspiration for them to make games. You know how there are authors that are referred to as \"writer's writers\"? I think you may be an indie developer's developer. So, how do you feel about being an inspiration to a bunch of people?", 
      "[silence, vague hissing and crackling from other end of phone etc]", 
      "Hm, there seem to have been some technical difficulties there.  Ok, I have one more question for you. As someone who's made a lot of games, what advice do you have for any budding indie developers out there?", 
      "YOU MUST CREATE A VIDEOGAME OR BE ENSLAVED BY ANOTHER MAN'S.", 
      "POSTSCRIPT: You may have noticed that, in the above article, the link to A1 Reviews takes you to a tumblr error page. Shortly after this interview was wrapped up, the site disappeared from the net. I contacted The Catamites to find out exactly what happened. Here is his explanation:",

      "As playwright and novelist Juli Kearns, one of the most convincing interviewees in “Room 237” (and the only woman), explains, the internal geometry of Kubrick’s hotel operates with a dreamlike non-logic, full of impossible switchbacks and reversing patterns, and with an exterior window (in the hotel manager’s office) where no window could possibly be. Much of the fun of “Room 237,” which has been an audience smash at festivals from Sundance to Cannes, Toronto and Austin’s Fantastic Fest, comes from Ascher’s dedication to explore these theories to their fullest. So we see graphic overlays of Kearns’ maps of the Overlook, featuring the circuitous and contradictory pathways through the corridors followed by Danny (Nicholson and Duvall’s son in the film) on his Big Wheel tricycle.", 
      "Isn’t it more plausible to suggest that the Indian-genocide references and the disturbing sexual undercurrents and the Minotaur labyrinth, and just possibly the Holocaust allusions that historian Geoffrey Cocks claims to discern, are strategic elements meant to accentuate the mood of menace and “uncanniness,” but that none is meant to predominate in itself? In other words, this really is a story about a guy going crazy in a snowbound old hotel and turning on his wife and kid, but one that draws on the most troubling aspects of myth, history and psychoanalytic theory to create an overdetermined landscape of madness, one in which the viewer ultimately feels almost as disoriented as Jack, frozen in permanent rage at the heart of the labyrinth.", 
      "I’m not saying that all these theories are created equal or that interpreting works of art is a democratic process. I won’t even bother debunking Weidner’s moon-landing thesis, which fails in exactly the same way as all other paranoid conspiracy theories. And there is definitely no hidden boner-shot in Jack’s interview with the manager and no secret Stanley Kubrick face in the clouds behind the opening credits. But even these ludicrous notions illustrate the real point of “Room 237,” as I see it, which is that “The Shining” is a disturbing, complicated and highly unusual creation of pop cinema that works on many levels, and whose slow-acting toxin continues to spread through our cultural veins more than 30 years later.",

      "Sonic's moveset is mostly based on the classic games; he can spin-dash as well as collect Power Sneakers, Shields and Invincibility power-ups if the player finds them, while adding the homing attack from the 3D games.",

      "As a bit of an in-joke to Sonic fans, Sega put up a listing of various characters within the series in early 2010 as possible playable characters. The list was set up in conjecture with a trivia contest, which promised to cross off names of non playable characters in the game as the community correctly answered trivia questions related to the franchise. By the end of the week all of the names except for Sonic were crossed off confirming that Sonic was to be the only playable character in the game.", 
      "Alton Towers, a UK theme park, will be renaming one of the roller coasters as \"Sonic Spinball\" to coincide with the game. The park said the \"retheme\" will be featuring Sonic's new \"relaunch\" design.", 
      "The footage then showed the first thirty or so seconds of Splash Hill Zone, Act 1. Though many suspected the footage of being fake, its validity would be confirmed when Sega asked 1UP to remove the screens and video later that day.", 
      "These gradual leaks continued until the last leaked footage - the final boss, the end credits and the reveal for Episode II that one is shown if they beat the game with all the Chaos Emeralds - was posted on April 3. With that last post, footage from every Act and one of the Special Stages had been posted for all the internet to see; most of the entire game had been shown months before it was even to be released.", 
      "Since this ultimatum, Sonic Retro has allowed discussion of Sonic 4 to recommence. An explanation as to why PartnerNET was taken offline the night of April 3 has never been given.", 
      "In the month-and-a-half following the infinity leaks, various livestreams of the entire game and higher quality footage leaks occurred, though nothing of any significance came out of those leaks and livestreams except for confirmation that infinity was not pulling an elaborate hoax.", 
      "On May 20, 2010, Sega finally responded to the Sonic 4 leaks (in addition to officially announcing the iOS version of the game), announcing that they would be delaying the release of Sonic 4. Instead of the promised summer release, the game would be released in the fall in order to give the development team time to fix elements of the game based on the \"fan feedback\" provided from the leaked footage.

In the two months that followed, Sega \"rerevealed\" the game, issuing new trailers and screenshots for each of the game's four zones. Like Lost Labyrinth Zone before it, the information drop for Casino Street Zone showed a new level (this one involving Sonic running on a bridge of playing cards) that fans following the leaks would later discover was, in fact, the console versions' replacement for the score challenge stage that was originally Casino Street Zone's second act.",

      "It was in a limousine speeding away from a special San Francisco screening of Jim Henson's 1982 fantasy \"The Dark Crystal\" that \"Labyrinth,\" Henson's next feature, was conceived. In the car with Henson, creator of the Muppets, were the film's conceptual and creature designer, Brian Froud, and puppet designer, Wendy Midener, who was the effects supervisor in charge of \"Dark Crystal's\" elflike creatures, the Gelflings.", 
      "It had been a long, five-year slog making the film, and Froud and Midener met and married during the course of it. The collaborators were exhausted and vowed never to undertake anything like it again. But on that ride away from the theater, Henson popped the question: \"Should we do another one?\"", 
      "Froud, on the phone from his in-laws' home in Michigan, chuckles at the recollection.", 
      "\"I think we might have had a couple of glasses of wine,\" he says. \"We said, 'Why not?' \"", 
      "Four years later, they unveiled \"Labyrinth,\" a darkly funny fantasy starring 14-year-old Jennifer Connelly as a teenager who meets all kinds of idiosyncratic creatures as she wends her way through the titular maze on a quest to rescue her baby brother (played by Froud and Midener's son, Toby) from David Bowie's Jareth the Goblin King. But in the early stages, neither Henson nor Froud had any notion of what the new film might be, discussing and rejecting various mythologies until Froud said, \"What about goblins?\"", 
      "\"Jim's eyes lit up. It was an area he understood,\" Froud says.", 
      "\"Because of Rackham and his drawings of fairy tales, I became interested in the tales and then gradually became interested in the reality behind fairy tales and real fairies,\" says Froud, who has written books on the subject. \"I've been trying to articulate those for about 30 years.\"", 
      "Froud's latest book, \"Brian Froud's World of Faerie,\" due out in September, encompasses those three decades of work. It was his 1978 collaboration with Alan Lee on the book \"Faeries\" that first brought Froud to Henson's attention and led to the invitation to work on \"The Dark Crystal.\"", 
      "When Froud began to consider what the next story might be, Henson had only one proviso: In contrast to \"The Dark Crystal,\" he wanted human characters to interact with the puppets and animatronics.", 
      "\"So I saw this baby,\" Froud says. \"And Jim said, 'Well, what's the story?' And I said, 'I don't know, this baby gets stolen,' because that's traditional in folklore - that's what goblins do. And another idea that flashed in my mind was the labyrinth, because a labyrinth can be a metaphor for so many things. That was the beginning.", 
      "\"I painted a picture of a baby surrounded by goblins,\" he adds. \"That picture was hanging in Jim's house in London for many years.\"", 
      "Other paintings and sketches followed, designed to offer a sense of what the labyrinth and the characters populating it might be.", 
      "\"Jim would say, 'Oh, I like that one. Let's finish that one, see where that goes.' And we'd start playing with prototypes,\" Froud says. \"And if Jim responded to that, we would start thinking about how we would make it, the mechanics and stuff.\"", 
      "Meanwhile, Henson and Dennis Lee were developing the story, based on the art Froud was producing, and he, in turn, invented more creatures in response to the work of the writers. With the script finally finished, Henson asked Terry Jones (\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\") to help with what was supposed to be merely a tweak of the screenplay.", 
      "Froud, who would go on to partner with Jones on a number of books, including \"Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book,\" laughs.", 
      "\"Of course, being Terry, he liked everything we were doing, but then he started to browse through my sketchbook, and there'd be lots of little scribbles in corners, and he'd say, 'Great! We've got to do that,' \" Froud says. \"And he sort of rewrote everything, and suddenly we were building nearly a whole set of new characters for the movie.\"", 
      "Froud says Jones put a new twist on the tale.", 
      "\"He gave it another start, which was great,\" he says, noting that the original story was more akin to \"Alice in Wonderland\" and other children's stories. \"It got quirkier and funnier with Terry's input.\"", 
      "Froud also designed costumes for \"Labyrinth,\" a job he shared with Ellis Flyte. Froud was responsible for dressing Bowie in his startling outfit that included skintight trousers.", 
      "The look was not accidental. The labyrinth represented the teenage protagonist's inner world, and Jareth the Goblin King was meant to stand in for various aspects of her inner life.", 
      "\"I played on that, because part of the costume is like Heathcliff, Brontë's Heathcliff, so a romantic figure. Also he's dangerous, so I gave him a leather jacket, like a leather boy,\" Froud says. \"He's also a knight, a knight in Grimm's fairy tales, so there's that aspect. And he's even like a ballet star, Baryshnikov, but of course one of the other major things was that he was like a film star or a pop star. He has that sort of charisma; he is this sort of strange dream figure.\"", 
      "Not everyone's imagination was as vivid as Froud's.", 
      "\"At the time, I think the critics didn't quite understand this aspect of it,\" he says, \"that he did reflect so much of her romantic turmoil.\"", 
      "Busy preparing sets or creatures for the movie, Froud did not get to spend a lot of time with Henson while he was filming, but he does remember that the director's sets were happy places.", 
      "\"He made people laugh a lot,\" he says of Henson, who died four years after \"Labyrinth\" premiered. \"There was something about Jim. He was a bright spirit. We all - the people who were lucky enough to collaborate with him - feel that we still carry a little spark of Jim wherever we go, whatever we do. His spirit lives on.\"", 
      "Froud is not surprised that \"Labyrinth\" warrants a theatrical rerelease and a lavish two-disc DVD edition (due out in August), for which he contributed audio commentary. Events like the Labyrinth of Jareth Fantasy Masquerade Ball and other fan conventions remain popular. And Froud need look only as far as his son to see the film's influence.", 
      "Now a puppeteer and sculptor, Toby Froud may not have definitive memories of his infant star turn, but, says his proud father, \"it inspired him. He loves making things like that now. He's totally involved with that world.\"",

Make sure you don't drop them by mistake; it's very easy to do that, unfortunately, and there's no way of retrieving items once you have dropped them. The second thing is to lit your light source (usually a torch). Yes, that's right, 'lit' it. The game sometimes lapses into a form of newspeak: to extinguish your lamp, you need to 'unlit' it again. The reason for this is of course that the game wasn't originally written in English: Frank Malota, the game's creator, is German.

Most notable among this team was a man who is just as responsible, if not more so, than Naka for making Sonic who he is today.

With Kodama and Hirokazu Yasuhara on designs and Naka helming the programming, Ōshima took on the task of coming up with the character itself. Close to two hundred ideas were tossed around by the development team until Sega settled on Ōshima’s hedgehog design, codenamed “Mr. Needlemouse.” Sonic The Hedgehog was born.", 
      "Artoon was absorbed by AQ Interactive in 2010 leaving Ōshima to rethink his future once more. He has mostly been out of the public eye since Artoon disappeared, but he resurfaced in 2011 to reunite with his former Sonic Team colleagues to celebrate Sonic’s twentieth anniversary. Ōshima was most recently seen visiting Naka and current Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka for a casual get-together. Now that both Naka and Ōshima are no longer with Sega, speculation has begun to mount as to whether the duo will reunite for a new project. Given their track record, only great things could come from such collaboration.",

You can listen to Yuji Naka wearily repeat the story of how he created Sonic, but it doesn’t beat the satisfaction of comparing the American, European, Japanese, Genesis, Game Gear, and prototype (!) versions of Gunstar Heroes… by PLAYING them.

I was bewitched by the aesthetic and the gameplay, even in that slapdash kiddie fighter.

Only difference is the PWM sound chip that’s thrown in and over 32,000 colors, an extra plane of graphics over Genesis video and all that good stuff. I own every single Sega console and Model except for the SMS 1 & 2 (thankfully I have 2 boxed Power Base Converters) and if anything I want to be able to play my games without using my cartridges. I have a collection and I preserve my games. If I want a good round of Knuckles Chaotix I’ll have to keep busting out one out of two of my complete copies until it’s released on a collection but please Sega (don’t listen to Simon Jeffrey), don’t shove too many collections down our throats or else we’ll have our fill and won’t even pay attention to the next, causing you to lose more sales because we’ll ignore them. You have to take risks. Don’t be scared and rely on craptastic Sonic titles and hundres of compilations. It’s time to switch on that lightbulb and create quality titles, or even revive some dead franchises like SOR, Vectorman, you know the big hits back then. I find the rumors of a new Hang On and Outrun game to my liking. Maybe put on that 90′s cap you have sitting in the closet and do what you did back then. It worked didn’t it? Then why did you have to change and screw it all up.", 
      "On a Sonic note: What Sonic needs is to be put back in a side-scrolling platform game. Some characters just fit better in certain worlds and definitely no contact with humans. Instead, Sega keeps making them in 3D probably because it’s just mainstream. Sadly, if Sega acutally and miraculously did create a 2D Sonic game on a HOME CONSOLE, if they screw up, even on a 2D game in which Sonic excels in, then I don’t know what to believe in anymore.", 
      "I’m a very very hardcore Sega fan alright… a late 80′s early 90′s Sega fan. The golden age of gaming. Where competition brought excellence… and where that competition was described in one word: SEGA.",

      "Shining Force CD really needs to get added to this compilation. Sonic CD would be fun but honestly there more than enough Sonic games. Also, Sega needs to do a good Saturn collection release, with all 3 scenarios for Shining Force 3 on it, as well as Panzer Dragoon Azel or whatever its called, best rpg I ever played. And they should do whatever is required to get Dragon Force on that disc, mmmmm Working Designs.",

      "In this, the era of crowdfunding, we’ve seen a bunch of developers from times gone by either returning the genres they love or to the industry altogether, but this is something I didn’t expect. ADOM felt like a lost thing. I’m also pretty sure there’s a postcard from teenage me somewhere in Biskup’s house, although it’s entirely possible I forgot to post it way back when.", 
      "Thomas, if you read this, look for one from Adam in Manchester!", 
      "ADOM’s brilliance is partly due to its sense of progression, with quests and some structure beyond plumbing the depths. There’s an overworld to sit on top of its dungeons, intricate character development and a corruption mechanic that can make you sprout a tail.", 
      "He’s looking to raise $48,000 and has 59 days left to gather it. I think there’s a very good chance this one will make it and that’d make me very happy indeed.", 
      "I love these rogue-likes, but the ASCII versions are a bit rough when you get older and your eyes aren’t what they used to be. I’d like to see a tiled variation like Stone Soup or Vutlure among other things, but that’s just me.", 
      "The ADOM update has an artist and a musician on the development team, suggesting that it’s going to be a graphical version.", 
      "If that were the case, why wouldn’t they have at least created a graphical mock-up for this video so people could get a good idea of what their money is going to produce?", 
      "From how the guy describes it, the way it looks now is the way it’s always going to look. I could be misunderstanding him though.", 
      "I remember Biskup saying that there wouldn’t be support for tiles, because the way of displaying stuff via console is so deeply integrated into the code that it would be too much work to replace. However, the artist is apparently going to help modernizing the UI a fair bit, if I’ve understood correctly.", 
      "Right now we are discussing to dom something about graphical tile support. But that’s not part of the basic campaign (which can’t be really changed that now it has started and our work efforts have been estimated). But it might be an interesting stretch goal.", 
      "I’ll discuss this once we get a little closer to the basic funding goal. If we don’t even make that there’s no sense in discussing the rest. And I’m not going to promise anything too early ;-)", 
      "But thanks for the suggestion!", 
      "As far as I can tell there’s going to be an Adom 2 but they’re asking for money to polish and debug the original game. It was all a bit confusing.", 
      "I really enjoyed ADOM so I’d happily give them some money but to be honest I’d rather it was going directly towards the sequel.", 
      "Despite what some people think I care deeply for ADOM and I don’t like seeing it exist in this somewhat incomplete and broken state. And that’s the minimum goal for the campaign (besides adding some nice and new features): I want to have stable versions for as many operating systems as we can manage with as many bug fixes and patched loop holes as possible.", 
      "Everyone who ever loved ADOM should ask himself if that’s worth anything between $10 and $50.000 (ok, the demigod pledge tier is not very probable, make that $250) and then pledge or not. The $48.000 is our realistic estimation for what baseline and afterwards we have a very strong line-up of cool new features and additions.", 
      "So the plan is to – at least – leave ADOM in a highly playable and up to date state… if more money is collected we’ll so how far it reaches.", 
      "The campaign shouldn’t affect ADOM II too much as I have a great team lined up and this should distribute the burden much better. And we’d have the money to buy resources to a certain extent.", 
      "But can read all those details on the blog ;-)", 
      "So, did you guys find Adam’s postcard? Did you find mine? I didn’t send one of São Paulo because I thought Thomas probably already had one but I’ll send one if you’d like.", 
      "Money? Pfft.", 
      "I know i’s sad but without tile support I’m out. DF is great with a tile set. Without I can’t do it at all.", 
      "“I’d like to see a tiled variation like Stone Soup or Vutlure among other things, but that’s just me.”", 
      "Sacrebleu! Someone who wants a tileset for a Roguelike!?! Unheard of! You special, unique little flower you… blazin’ a trail with your originality there.", 
      "Hint: You’re not the only person who prefers tilesets in a RL.", 
      "I’ve been playing Roguelikes since the original Rogue, and I love having graphical options now. It lets you see so much more at a glance, and a decent mouse interface makes gameplay a lot smoother and more intuitive.", 
      "” It lets you see so much more at a glance”", 
      "Actually the opposite is true. Brain registers and processes a simple symbol much faster than evaluating an image.", 
      "“a decent mouse interface makes gameplay a lot smoother and more intuitive.”", 
      "More like distorted. For example, Crawl has autoexplore. Does it really need the dungeon layout representation anymore ? It may as well be a random encounter system in JRPGs.", 
      "At least we have scheduled UI enhancements (like colored messages and other stuff) as one of the things  we’d like to do. But we’ll discuss them with the community and take suggestions and then decide what can be done. But I agree that some things probably should be enhanced.", 
      "Mouse support and graphics are nothing I need but we’ll listen to the community (although tile support is beyond the scope of the basic project).", 
      "“Actually the opposite is true”", 
      "Bullshit. With decent sprite graphics, I can see immediately exactly what kind of creature I’m up against, what it’s wielding, whether it’s holding anything, how big it is, what colour it is, how much health it has if there’s on-screen health bars, and if there’s a halfway decent UI I can just mouse over it for every other piece of detail.", 
      "Brogue impressively does almost all of this with ASCII graphics, but it could still be clearer still with decent art.", 
      "Health numbers are largely pointless. What the game DOES tell you by mousing over an enemy is exactly how often it’ll hit you, what percentage of your health it’ll do, and how many hits it could kill you in, if you rolled badly on each round. Now *that’s* useful.", 
      "I agree with Domonic, no way is a symbol easier than a sprite. When a see a yellow Y I haven’t a clue what it is, if I see a little green man with a sword I pretty much no it’s some creature with a sword maybe a goblin or orc as it’s green.", 
      "ASCII takes some time to get into it, but with use of look-command you’ll soon learn what those symbols mean… and I prefer ASCII, since it let’s me fill in the details much better than tilesets. :P", 
      "By your own admission there, ASCII offers less information than sprites – if you need to use the Look command to see what it is that you’re fighting and what it’s carrying, then you’ve added an entire layer of pointless complexity to the game, while something with halfway reasonable graphics will let you see at a glance exactly what you’re up against and whatever it’s holding.", 
      "I guess this kickstarter-alike is targeted at people who already play ADOM? I’m in my 20’s and I got into roguelikes through Stone Soup’s tiled interface, as did several of my friends. I have no doubt that previous generations are comfortable with ASCII, but a younger audience is going to want at least some kind of visual representation.", 
      "I’m OK with not being part of the target group, but it might be a good idea to find a way to appeal to a newer generation of gamers.As it stands, acclimatizing myself to a text interface is not how I want to spend my time off work.", 
      "I’ve been playing roguelikes for a good 20 years, and while I’m willing to put up with ASCII/ANSI, any time there’s an even vaguely decent tileset available instead the little ‘k’s and ‘o’s can bugger right the fuck off.", 
      "I don’t think he was claiming to be the ONLY person who preferred a tileset for his roguelikes. Is there really any reason for you to be such a colossal knob about it?", 
      "It’s because you people can’t see into the matrix, while I can, as I play DF tile-less. I AM THE CHOSEN ONE. THERE IS NO SPOON.", 
      "Spent a huge amount of time playing this on the Amiga in the mid 90s. Definitely throwing these chaps some cash.", 
      "BTW, we still are going to support the Amiga (Jochen is a huge Amiga fans from the golden days).", 
      "Thomas definetly deserves some cash for ADOM. One of the best roleplaying games on computers he developed for free.", 
      "But 48000$ sounds a bit lot to me.", 
      "He did develop the game for free in first place. If it actually had that kind of budget requirement he definitely would not (could not) do it for free.", 
      "Also as I understood all they plan to do is squash bugs and add new content. But there is allready more content anyone non hardcore will see. And the game is pretty much stable.", 
      "I will put some money in it as payback for old play time. (and everyone should)", 
      "But as new enterprise , it didnt really grab me.", 
      "$48k, split between four people on the development team = A pittance if this update/remake is going to be in development for more than a couple months. Even a small commercial indie game these days has an effective development budget of several hundred thousand.", 
      "Well, i guess you are right.", 
      "Anyways. I hope it will get funded", 
      "Thanks for understanding. We really wrestled hard with the cost part as I know how hard it will be to reach that goal. But due to having failed to deliver anything between 2002 and now I did not want to run into the “I’m too optimistic about available resources” trap again. That’s how the number came to be after many Excel sheets and the like.", 
      "I am sorry about being confused about the budget.", 
      "I am positive this game will work very well for new generation of gamers as well as for old.", 
      "And as many will agree 3D graphic didnt bring much to game “immersion” , but modern interface on other hand only brought improvements :)", 
      "So, if there was one thing I would add – it would be it.", 
      "You may want to try Dungeons of Dredmor. It’s a roguelike that goes way beyond the standard, and it’s a blast to play. I personally can’t stand roguelikes yet I find myself putting way too much time into it.", 
      "The trick with most roguelikes is to find the command that allows you to keep moving until you either spot danger or hit a wall or something. Holding down one key is basically suicide. I should know, I’ve lost so many characters that way.", 
      "I concur on the Dungeons of Dredmor suggestion.", 
      "I may or may not be that poster you talk about, but I will reply on it.", 
      "The reason that stone soup has a negative influence on me (and probably others), is that for me it’s hard to go back to ascii-roguelikes. For that reason. Ascii vs tiles. I’m spoiled.", 
      "Brogue is prettier than Stone Soup. Arguably better game, too. Also shorter.", 
      "I played Stone Soup many years back and had the same experience: inescapable monsters who were stronger and faster than I was, and who noticed me the instant I came across them. I too was put off by this, but don’t let it ruin roguelikes for you. I’d recommend you try Brogue: as far as roguelikes go, it tends to be fairer than most (although you will still die a lot), but there is at least the chance of losing a monster that is chasing you by clever use of traps or bodies of water, not always forcing you to rely on rare consumables for escape.", 
      "Then again, you might just hate roguelikes, and that’s okay too.", 
      "Wow, really? That’s a very good description of vanilla Dungeon Crawl, where the first time you find something stronger than you it’ll also be faster than you and you’re screwed. Stone Soup turned it into a game I actually could play. Great times being a Troll Death Knight, constantly worrying whether the corpse at your feet would best serve you as a minion or as food. Or a Troll Ranger, whose long distance weapons are boulders. I called him Chucky.", 
      "I’m seconding the recommendation for Brogue.  It also has the auto-explore feature that you find in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, but it’s a bit simpler and won’t take as much practice before you will start to feel like you know what you’re doing.  Not that Brogue is easy by any means, it’s just a smaller-scale game.  Stone Soup is the kind of game you can play for years and years, so it sort of inevitably starts slowly.", 
      "I know what you mean about Stone Soup making other roguelikes hard to play, though.  I miss auto-explore in any roguelike that doesn’t have it.  ADOM is tough because it’s very old-school in its interface, including missile weapons and spells that can only be fired in one of eight directions.  It does not have auto-explore but it does let you fast-travel in a specific direction, stopping if you reach an intersection or spot an enemy.", 
      "Dungeons of Dredmor is also lots of fun.  No auto-explore but there’s usually something interesting just a few steps away at any given moment.  It’s mostly entertaining for the ridiculous items and enemies that you’ll find.", 
      "You could play a faster species. A Spriggan can run away from anything in the game, as far as I know. And if you come across something that’s faster than you in general, well, you should have some sort of nuke-the-bastards wand around by then, or an identified potion of invisibility or speed, or a scroll of blink, or some other way to at least get to the nearest stairs and either continue downward or escape to the previous floor and then go around.. if you haven’t anything that’ll help, you’ve either been incredibly unlucky, or haven’t been exploring diligently enough on your way down.", 
      "I play Stone Soup a bit; I’m not very good; I die a lot. Practically every time I die I look at my inventory afterwards and go “Crap, I had one of those! Why didn’t I use it?!”", 
      "Well, I think it’s true that DCSS has a negative influence on other roguelikes, mainly because it’s so much better and polished than them.", 
      "It’s true that DCSS is pretty hard and unforgiving, but it never punishes a player who was patient and  careful.  Well, almost never, a really unlucky game can happen sometimes, but it’s not usual.", 
      "For instance, what you found too hard, “being one-shotted by an ogre, being chased and killed by mosters that were stronger and faster”, is something that doen’t happen to someone who knows how to play DCSS: there is almost always a way to escape from danger, be it using an escape spell, reading a scroll, drinking a potion, using a consummable or just running away to a stair. The main error that someone who isn’t used to this kind of game does is thinking that every monster found can be face immediately; Crawl pushes you to analyze the situation and run away if necessary, and especially at the beginning running away *is* necessary. I won the game only one time in one year of play, but each and every time I lost I knew the fault was mine; I don’t recall a situation in the last few months where I couldn’t have escaped death, had I been a little more careful.", 
      "Apart from this, I find Crawl great for one reason: it’s completely removed any reason (and possibility) to grind or farm. It pushes you to explore new levels without a break, it doesn’t have shops where you can sell items (removing so any reason to pick up any item which isn’t useful and to do boring travelling between stashes of items and shops), and it lets a great deal of freedom in a strategical and tactical sense. Besides, the autoexplore and autotravel functions are something I couldn’t play a roguelike without.", 
      "ADOM was first released in 1994, last updated in 2002, still closed source (unlike every other major roguelike), and now he wants funding? WAT?", 
      "And what’s the real problem about that? As I said dozens of times – the basic question is if a new version of ADOM is worth anything to you between $10 and $250. If the answer is “yes” please pledge as soon as possible and if the answer is “no” just leave it at that.", 
      "Life can be very simple :-)", 
      "And I won’t get into the “open versus closed” source discussion here ;-) That has been done a couple of times in other places (once again) a lot of times. But the highest stretch goal is to release ADOM as open source. I personally doubt we’ll get there but it will have to be seen… exciting times and scale effects on Internet are something hard to guess beforehand.", 
      "Is there any contract involved?  Source release was stated to occur in the past, and did not.", 
      "I’m not too big on ADOM or roguelikes in general, but I have a lot of respect for Thomas Biskup and the time/effort he put into this game, so I might give him a small donation regardless.", 
      "Also, props for using fixed funding rather than the awful flexible funding every other project on Indigogo seems to be madly in love with.", 
      "That’s also a matter of honor for me: Either we get enough funds to really do an awesome job or we’ll mourn and move on. To me it just doesn’t make sense to try (again) to achieve something with insufficient resources. I had that experience a couple of times between 2002 and today, you know ;-)", 
      "Amiga support, eh? Gads, I wonder if my A1200 will still boot.", 
      "How does ADOM compare to Dwarf Fortress’ Adventure mode? I haven’t played Adventure mode in few months.", 
      "It certainly isn’t as expansive as DF’s adventure mode, but ADOM plays more intuitively and with more variety in what you see and do.", 
      "I’ve been playing ADOM for roughly twenty years, Biskup can absolutely have my money.", 
      "Wait…", 
      "Isn’t ADOM the game where the guy many years ago promised to release the source code, and then didn’t do it?", 
      "I know reading can be hard, so I’ll quote you something of interest from the answer.", 
      "Roguelikes should come with source.  Then all this upgrading would just happen.", 
      "With several other roguelikes having their code open and available, I’m not sure ADOM ever needed to go that route.", 
      "That would be great! Then we could get a definitive spoiler wiki with every secret baked into the game, thereby extracting every bit of mystique out of the game that we can.  :-/", 
      "In other news: your expectation is patently false.", 
      "Why the snark?", 
      "If you don’t want spoilers, you don’t have to read them. Nethack is open source and people don’t generally ruin the game for themselves by looking up spoilers unless they want to. That doesn’t really affect the value of what was an all but abandoned great game going open source.", 
      "I suppose it depends on intentions, and the desire for the preservation of the game’s mystery seems to come from the developer himself. That was always my understanding, but I could be wrong. If a man wishes his secret sauce to remain secret, I don’t see why “roguelikes should come with source” must apply to his game.",

      "I used to think this.  I used to resent ADOM for not releasing the source, and stopped playing it for that reason.  I can’t figure out why I ever did either of those things.", 
      "The Doom and Quake series have had their source code released for free under the GPL.  Lots of extra cool versions were made of those games (e.g. psdoom), and lots of cool free games/mods were made using them (e.g. Tremulous).  Does that mean that every FPS should be open source?  Every game?", 
      "We’ve been spoiled by Nethack, Angband, other roguelikes.  Why should a whole genre be declared an open source zone because of a few early examples?  Are we all going to stop playing Dwarf Fortress because it’s not open source?", 
      "Don’t get me wrong.  I like open source.  I love free software (“freedom” in the GPL sense).  I use Linux and tons of other free software.  I would love for the entire world to be GPLed one day.  But I think that open source should be about promoting its growth and surpassing the quality of closed source, not about stifling software by demanding that it be open source or else not be produced.", 
      "Also, I do also think that the ADOM license terms suggested by the author (no modified versions, etc.) are complete BS.  You don’t open the source just so people can look at it; you do it so that the community can build on your efforts, or so that distributions like Debian can include your program and patch it to fit the distribution (including security patches).  So I don’t blame the users for calling him on that, but it’s an unfortunate turn of events overall.",

Add to that full mod support with steam workshop and it has the potential to become the best roguelike ever made. I just hope one day they make it so the armour you equip appears on the character because I love that visual progression feeling.", 
      "They’ve been pretty clear that the armor thing wont happen. The sheer amount of art assets it would take to cover all the armors and all the available character animations is such a staggering number that getting the art done would take far too many hours, and it would be far too expensive.", 
      "Oh my god I played so much Adom when I was younger, I know exactly what’s going on in that screenshot – you’re in the first town, Terinyo, about to talk to the Druid which sends you down his quest line (instead of the village elder’s quest line). The Druid’s quest is way better because there isn’t a retarded escort quest at the end of it and you get a guaranteed artifact, even if it is cursed. (I gave that god an artifact, gods love artifacts).", 
      "Thats actually the second town, which is an anagram for “hole in the wall”, and he is presumably killing the mad doctor, good on you for trying though :)", 
      "If I remember correctly, there’s actually a good reason to skip the quest because of that very reason – it effectively reduces the number of times you can get crowned by one. The reason is that crowning requires a certain character level vs. the number of artifacts generated, and late-game there are so many artifacts that you won’t ever get below the limit again. So generating artifacts early is actually a *bad* idea.", 
      "Also, if you think gods like artifacts, try offering a few hundred blessed stomafilia herbs. These things were broken. Ah, good times :)", 
      "If you are familiar with my name (which I’ve had for a while) you will know I’m a big fan, and obviously going to donate. Adom to me always stood so far above the competition, that it was not a competition at all.", 
      "Alot of the newer games play way to slow and feel like a complete grind (dredmor, despite playing it 135 hours). What I have always loved is the pacing of ADOM, I just now made a new character and it took me 3 minutes to hit level 5, including finishing the small cave and finding a nice mithril sword. When you are going to have a perma death game this is essential, and at the core of its charm, and as such games with animations are actually detracting from my enjoyment.  When it takes you half an hour to clear the first level, instead of 3 minutes, it gives the game an entirely different feel, one thats been lost in translation to the more casual games.",

While there are limited opportunities in the game to mitigate or remove corruption effects, taking too long to close the chaos gate causes the corruption rate to increase dramatically.

This presents a unique dilemma to characters who specialize in smithing: should they use powerful artifacts or enhanced items of their own design?

Unlike ADOM which was written primarily in C++, JADE would use Java, allowing for more features, greater complexity, more content, and broader scope due to the efficiency and power that development in Java would enable. As ADOM development wound down, JADE development progressed sporadically in fits and starts until it eventually dragged to a near halt in the early 2000's. No playable versions of the game were released.", 
      "In 2011, Thomas returned to JADE development with renewed vigor and determination, and just in time for his birthday in July, he managed to release the first barebones playable version of the game in version 0.1.0. At the start of 2012, Thomas decided to rename JADE to ADOM II, relegating the JADE name to referring strictly to the underlying engine powering the game. Thomas has said that he is working hard to maintain a \"release early, release often\" philosophy in making ADOM II, which is intended to result in major new releases every couple of months.", 
      "Throughout ADOM II's (and JADE's) long development, Thomas has openly discussed the game's development on his blog with the ADOM fan community. Although Thomas has always retained ultimate creative control over the design development of the game, community input has informed many facets of the game, including technical features, audio/visual presentation, game balance/design, quest fiction, and more. Fan contributions will even provide the game's logo design and all of its music.",

The campaign was successful and Thomas hired a couple of community members to become co-developers on the project to modernize and expand ADOM.",

      "In ADOM, the player controls a single character whose configuration of race, class, etc. can be either randomly determined or specifiied by the player. Every character has a set of base stats that determined natural prowess and can be increased through various means during the game. Base stats include:", 
      "Characters also have a base speed, which normally starts at 100, and affects how quickly the character gets to take turns compared to other creatures (higher speed means acting more often). And characters have an alignment rating, which comprises a linear spectrum with nine possibilities that are derived from the alignments used in traditional Dungeons & Dragons. Alignment can be radically altered by starting race and class, as well as many types of actions taken while playing the game.", 
      "ADOM has a considerable learning curve due to its overall difficulty, which itself is determined in large part by the player's choice of race and class, and its interface: the keyboard. ADOM has 100 keyboard commands, although only a fraction of them are used regularly. Some of the more unusual ones include n to name yourself or another creature and E to clean your ears. It takes a little time to learn the basics like pressing > to descend a staircase or Z to cast spells, but soon enough they become second nature. Although the arrow keys can be used to move in the four cardinal directions, the numpad is preferable as it additionally offers the possibility of diagonal movement, which is a major advantage in ADOM's tactical and deadly combat.", 
      "Combat--the most common type of action in ADOM aside from simple movement--is handled just like movement: move into a space occupied by another creature to initiate a melee attack against it. There are many small exceptions to this,but they generally following common sense, such as a giving the player a prompt for confirmation before attacking a non-hostile creature.", 
      "Missile weapons and some spells can be fired at range.", 
      "In ADOM, the actions the player takes are always final and usually carry considerable consquences. The game may only be saved as part of exiting (by pressing S). ADOM keeps only one savegame file per character, so there is no saving and reloading to undo actions or decisions. If a player's character dies, that character's savegame file is deleted, and the character is permanently deceased and can no longer be played. Dead characters are enshrined in a local hall of fame, like a scoreboard, which assigns each character a score based on his or her lifetime accomplishments, and then ranks them. Factors such as experience level, quests completed, number of turns taken, and many others all contribute in various ways to this final score. Each character's cause of death is also recorded beside their entry in the hall of fame for the player to be reminded of how they brought each of their characters to an end.", 
      "Upon starting a new game of ADOM, the player gets to decide on some of the specifics of the character he or she wishes to play, while other details are randomly determined. The player may choose a race, a class, a gender, a name, answers to a random set of personal/moral questions to determine initial stat distribution, and his or her starting talents. The player also has the choice to leave each of these things except name to chance. Factors that are always randomly determined include birth star sign, auspicious birth events, eye and hair color, age, and biography.",

      "While I was working on my roguelike game, I would take a break and started a few platformers that didn’t get anywhere. However, you can see that some of the graphics from these prototypes made their way into Spelunky.", 
      "To extrapolate the last bullet point, there are some challenges with randomized platform level design that are smoothed over by the implementation of destructible terrain and climbing tools. Plus, caves! Putting your game in a cave is a great excuse to make nonsensical but interesting levels, hehe.", 
      "I briefly went over the level generation in Spelunky here. First, each level is divided into a grid of 16 rooms.", 
      "A path is drawn from the entrance of the level at the top, to the exit of the level at the bottom.", 
      "Each room is selected from a set of room templates. Which set it’s selected from depends on where the room lies on the path from the entrance to the exit.", 
      "There are randomized “chunks” in each room template that add some variation.", 
      "Finally, I add the critters, traps, treasures, and other fun stuff! There are some other things to consider (for example, the placement of special rooms), but that’s the basic idea.", 
      "Generating things algorithmically has its upsides. You can’t develop levels that are as good as hand-made levels, but it’s exciting to run around in a dungeon that you know no one else has ever seen or will ever see again. Plus, when you get yourself out of a bind, it really feels like a miracle!", 
      "And I stated that I like the analogy, but even though many developers choose to be one or the other, I feel that you can be a mulch and tree person both, to great success.", 
      "Here’s where Andy took over (and yes, he really does have two belly buttons - or at least, one belly button and one thing that looks like a belly button). Andy is doing a bit of everything, but mostly programming. I’ve known him for almost half my life, but this is the first time we’ve ever collaborated on something! He’s a great all-around talent to work with, and a super-nice dude, to boot.",

      "All-in-all, we didn’t lose too much time to our new engine, and it’s made development smoother once we got back up to speed. There’s definitely a time and a place to roll your own code. Also, I’d personally rather that Jon spend his time working on The Witness than do tech support for us, wouldn’t you agree?", 
      "The original game is great, but what excited me about Spelunky XBLA was the chance to expand upon the original and try new things. It’s not a true sequel, but it’s also not a remake or port. This segues nicely into a rundown of some of the updates we’re making to the basic game:", 
      "This comparison image is quite fun to look at. It’s an interesting process to riff off your own artwork like this. There’s all of the fun of re-imagining something without the guilty feeling of being unoriginal! Not that a little explorer-man in a cave is all that original, but you catch my drift.", 
      "I have a great time doing both pixel art and high-res art - another reason to keep playing with Game Maker in between commercial projects! Now I just need to learn 3d…", 
      "The interface in the original game was not as smooth as it could have been. A lot of interactions require more button presses than necessary. For example, to buy an item in the original game, you had to pick the item up, which required two button presses, and then hit another button to buy the item. In Spelunky XBLA, you can stand in front of the item and just hit “RB”.", 
      "We teased some new stuff here! The high-resolution artwork lends itself to a bigger world, with more goodies to play with. And so it shall be!", 
      "At the end, we made the announcement that Spelunky XBLA will feature co-op multiplayer (offline), although we didn’t go into detail about what other modes will be offered. This was a feature that was requested heavily for the original game, but never made it in due to the amount of work that would be involved. We’ve been developing the XBLA game with it in mind, however.", 
      "We’re happy with how it’s turning out. Let’s just say that 4x the players = 4x the shenanigans…", 
      "And that’s the end of the talk! Hope you enjoyed it."

      "Okay, for those not in the know: what the hell is Spelunky?", 
      "Spelunky is a platformer where every level is randomly-generated. So each time you play you get a new layout and a new adventure. The game was inspired by roguelike games, which are meant to be played many times. As such, there's a lot to discover and many ways to interact with your environment. You start with a supply of bombs, so you can even blow up the terrain.", 
      "The goal is to find the ultimate treasure at the bottom of the caves and end the game with as much money as possible so you can brag to your friends or make new ones, even!", 
      "And the game' s been available for free online for a while, hasn't it...", 
      "Yeah! I released the freeware version in 2008, just for fun. From there it took off!", 
      "What was the decision behind bringing it to XBLA now?", 
      "Jonathan Blow, the creator of Braid, became a fan of the game and suggested that I put it on XBLA. He even put me in touch with Microsoft so I could pitch the idea to them. That guy's been really generous with his time... you can tell he's very invested in supporting indie games and generally making the world a better place, which is super-cool.", 
      "I'll do my best to pay it forward.", 
      "And what sort of tweaks and changes are you making to it?", 
      "The upgrade to the graphics and music are the most obvious change, but we're also putting a lot of effort into smoothing out the controls and interface. I want to make the game really polished so that people can get to exploring the game as quickly as possible. And speaking of exploring... we'll definitely be adding new EVERYTHING to the caves, including monsters, traps, and level types. There will be plenty of stuff in there that veterans of the original Spelunky have never seen.", 
      "Is there anything new you can tell us/show us of the game's XBLA version?", 
      "Sure, here's a new screenshot from the game, showcasing the jetpack and shotgun you'll use.", 
      "How many of you are on the creative team?", 
      "Right now it's three of us. Me, my friend Andy Hull, who's doing design and coding, and Eirik \"Phlogiston\" Surhke, who's working on music. Andy is a former toy designer who I've known for over 10 years, when we met in the Klik n' Play community. Eirik has composed music for a lot of indie games, and runs Pause Music, a label for indie music and chiptunes.", 
      "How did this all start originally? What was the original thinking behind Spelunky?", 
      "I had just finished Aquaria with my buddy Alec Holowka and I wanted to make a little freeware game to relax. I made a few prototypes for platformers and roguelikes before I realized it might be a good idea to combine ideas from both genres and make a platform game that could be played hundreds or thousands of times without getting bored. What really tied the idea together, though, was the bombs and ropes - with these tools the player wouldn't be constrained to a single path. It made level generation a lot easier because I wouldn't have to worry about players getting stuck as much, and could add areas that were completely closed off.", 
      "And what' s your background in the game development field?", 
      "I started out in the Klik community, making games with Clickteam's Klik n' Play and Multimedia Fusion programs. The way I make games now is not so different from when I was a kid, actually. The only differences are that the tools have gotten better, the communities have gotten bigger, and there are more channels to get your games out to people. It's amazing to me that you can release a freeware game today and there's a chance it will become an XBLA title!", 
      "It's received a lot of praise from all quarters - Team Meat seem to love the game. How's that feel?", 
      "It feels great! Especially because it was so unexpected. You always hope that people will enjoy the same things you do, but it's hard to know. As a developer you always brace yourself for disappointment, so when people you really respect tell you you did something good, it gives you a lot of validation.", 
      "Even criticism is great - it shows you that people care enough about your work to write something. I try to remember that when I'm online and give people good feedback whenever I can.", 
      "How do you design a game where the dungeons/cave combinations are unlimited?", 
      "You just have to add enough elements to the game that can be changed each time you play! In Spelunky, not only are the cave layouts randomized, but the placement of monsters, traps, treasure, and items are randomized. But just having a large number of combinations is not enough - you want the levels to feel \"purposeful\". The more it feels like a hand-created level, the better.", 
      "Thoughts on a PSN/Wii/3DS version?", 
      "I probably won't be releasing the game for PSN or Wii any time soon. A handheld version of the game would be cool, but I'm more interested in releasing a PC version first. Even though I'm really excited to be working on my first console game, I love PC gaming and am very grateful to the fans of the original game. In a just world they'd get to play the new game on PC at some point (no promises about when that will be).", 
      "What' s next for you?", 
      "Finish the game! But beyond Spelunky, I'd like to return to making new freeware, which is the most fun for me. It's also the best place to test out my new ideas. And I need to get back into traditional art, like drawing and painting. I'm getting too comfortable with Photoshop!", 
      "What, to you, are the foundations that make the ultimate 2D game?", 
      "Cool game world and characters, well-balanced challenge, and lots of variety. Oh, and great art and music!", 
      "What titles are you most hyped for this year?", 
      "I'm pretty hyped for Fez, which is coming out for XBLA. And I'll be very interested to see where Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft will be in a year. Both those games are already available to play, but are also in constant development.", 
      "As far as mainstream games go, all my hyped games are sequels: Duke Nukem Forever, Mortal Kombat, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and Diablo 3. I actually don't mind playing sequels at all. Part of it is the nostalgia-factor, of course, but it's also fun to see how a series evolves over the years. Video game development is a highly iterative process.", 
      "Any recommendations for free online titles (aside from your own) that we should play?", 
      "I already mentioned Dwarf Fortress. It's the most complex simulation I've ever played, and it's incredibly interesting just to read about. The stories that come out of playing the game rival most pre-scripted fantasy narratives, in my opinion.", 
      "If you like classic horizontal shoot 'em ups, try out Hydorah - it's a real labor of love. If you want to play a great puzzle game, play Desktop Dungeons - it's got randomly-generated levels like Spelunky and it's great fun.", 
      "Finally, if you're looking for something a bit different and you're a fan of the surreal, try the RPG Space Funeral. There are a lot of great freeware games out there!"

      "What’s up, man? I kinda want to circle around here…are you playing anything lately?", 
      "I feel the same way. It’s like a game has to have serious catch…I need to fall in love, I need to have sex with the game to bring it to completion. It doesn’t happen often.", 
      "I’ve been listening to lots of podcasts about it. I’m excited. I have not played a lot of the other ones but I do own them, they are cool.", 
      "Something I was wondering: Are we in a new renaissance of difficult gaming? Is that an accurate statement?", 
      "I think it is. I’m happy about it. They still aren’t hard in the way that old games are hard and I think that’s a good thing. Being someone who plays a lot of retro games, they were HARD because they were expensive, and short. They weren’t hard because they were making that design decision for the benefit of the game. So I feel like the difficulty that we’re seeing now is considered in the design, it’s part of the DNA of the game. Whereas the difficulty then was something there to make the game last longer, but not necessarily to make the game better.", 
      "And you created the Daily Challenge. I take my daily, that’s like my gaming vitamin!", 
      "It’s great! You can make a habit of it.  And, every time I play it, there’s always a point where I’m challenged at a part in it, and I try to tap into the psychic universe, like “someone else is here right now, if we all hold hands, we can feel the other person playing this level in the exact same spot I’m in.” It’s like, there’s something more. Just the fact that I’m playing it and knowing that everyone else is being frustrated with it, and experiencing it in somewhat the same way.", 
      "The other aspect of it is that it isn’t a straight drop-in solution, since not all of the graphics in the game are scaled the same amount. You’d have pixels of different sizes and you’d have it so when the character moves they wouldn’t be moving between the pixels correctly. You’d get the weird vibe of retro pixel art, but none of the game is working like a pixel game does, and I’m not sure how that would fly. I did also investigate a bit of code where the game behind the scenes was running the same code, but right before it drew it, it snapped everything to the nearest pixel. The game actually DOES do that, even normally, as the art is snapped to the nearest pixel as it draws to avoid blurring or artifacting from the graphics card.", 
      "Has anyone asked you that before? I feel like everyone says “forget the old pixel art”, etc.", 
      "The other thing people really talked about a lot was the music change. You know, I have nostalgia for the original music. In fact, the deathmatch music has a little riff to the original music as a throwback. But then you have people who love the new music so much! You realize people are going to fall in love with what it is, but until they do there’s going to be a little backlash, and it doesn’t mean it’s bad, right? We got negative feedback about the music in the beginning, but now we get tons of mail that says “I love it, it sounds like a crazy old genesis game but updated!” We get tons of love for it. It’s just one of those things where the thing you’re exposed to is what you latch onto, you acclimate to it and it becomes like your comfort food.",

      "We knew that once we put the Steam version out we were toast, right? You can open the file up, look at the memory, pull the images out…anything we had in there was exposed at that point. The real discovery part came on the Xbox, since people had to be good at the game to find it all. We added a secret world, but one of our testers was even able to find it, before the game was out!", 
      "Do you think you miss that in your own gaming experience? Do you still find moments of mystery in your gaming time?", 
      "I like the idea: class-action lawsuit against Blizzard! You could be onto something!", 
      "I don’t want to downplay that, I suppose. But I still get romanced by the mystery of a game, and sometimes I just wonder if we’re losing a lot of that.", 
      "I think the saddest part is not that games are not like that, but that they CAN’T be like that anymore. The sad part is that even if the developer wants it to be that way, it can never be that way, and that’s heartbreaking.",

If a wood stockpile is created, a \"haul lumber to\nstockpile\" job forms whenever there is a spare log and available\nroom in the stockpile.

With that, however, \"Adventure mode\" has been vastly improved in an effort to prepare it for a more seamless integration with Fortress mode. It is now possible to aim at specific body parts, which makes combat much more interesting; become a revered hero with the various nations in the world; visit castles with lots of hireable soldiers and fight fearsome \"night creatures\" and menacing outlaw bands.",

This millenia-spanning process includes building the natural world, such as the formations of lakes or deserts, the arrangement of geological strata, and the spread of flora and fauna, as well as simulating the lives of the previous inhabitants of the world, such as the complete lives of heroes and villains, wars between nations, and the rise and fall of entire civilizations. No two worlds are alike, and any changes made to the world during play will persist.", 
      "Dwarf Fortress is most well known for its Fortress Mode, in which you control a dwarven outpost in the style of a sandbox city builder game. The game provides no explicit goal or objectives. There is only survival, and even that is sometimes optional.", 
      "Additionally, there is Adventurer Mode, which is a fully featured roguelike adventure game in which you control a single character and explore the world you previously generated, including old fortresses.", 
      "As you might expect from the title of the game, Fortress mode is the main focus of play in Dwarf Fortress. In this mode you are tasked with the founding of a new dwarven outpost. You're able to pick the location of your fort, the skills of the seven dwarves you embark with, as well as the items and livestock you choose to bring with you. Your choice of location largely determines what type of fort you end up making in addition to how challenging it may be. Embarking near a haunted ocean, for example, gives you access to unique beachfront property, though you must first fight off the zombie and skeletal fish that walk upon the land.", 
      "Your ultimate goals are up to you, though it usually makes sense to bring in enough food and drink to survive and generate enough wealth to be filthy rich. Expansion is based off of fortress wealth, and you attract migrants and enemies as this number goes up.", 
      "The dwarves are the most important part of Fortress mode, serving as your workforce, military, and populace. Each dwarf is unique and comes to your fort with their own name, profession, and family. Dwarves also have their own likes and dislikes, preferences for food or pets, and even internal thoughts of their own. These thoughts, such as \"Admired a finely made bed recently\" or \"Was forced to sleep on the ground recently\" serve as positive/negative modifiers to a dwarf's mood; too much negative, and a dwarf will throw a tantrum, taking out his anger on furniture and creatures. Strained dwarves push to their limits will eventually go insane, resulting in their own suicide or the murder of others.", 
      "Experienced players tend to work on what are called \"megaprojects\". These are projects of the most grand scale, usually involving many in-game years of commitment. Examples include giant pyramids, chasm-spanning bridges, towering statues carved out of the mountainside, and many more. Some players also prefer to focus their megaproject ideas on death traps, with more than one fortress developing a huge magma reservoir that is able to spill out into the countryside at the flick of a lever.", 
      "Though lacking a true end, it is inevitable that a fortress must crumble at some point, spawning the popular motto for the game, \"Losing is Fun!\" Seen as an ironic (albeit rather accurate) statement, both the players and developer alike have claimed that losing in Dwarf Fortress is the real \"fun\" of the game. This is in reference to the numerous ways a player can lose the game, such as from a goblin siege or accidentally flooding their fortress with magma. These losses are often what spawn the many unique and entertaining stories that have made Dwarf Fortress as popular as it is today.", 
      "Though not as fleshed out or as popular as the above Fortress mode, Adventurer mode serves as an interesting roguelike component to the game. In this mode you control a single adventurer (as a human, elf, or dwarf.) As in Fortress mode, you have no real goal or end game. Your options are open, allowing you to slay megabeasts in caves or simply explore the countryside. Due to the complete freedom you are also allowed to do some rather despicable acts, such as slaughtering a peaceful town or setting fire to the forests. Everything you do in this mode is persistent, and anyone you kill remains dead throughout all modes.", 
      "Adventurer mode's original purpose was to explore old forts you created in Fortress mode. Once a fort crumbles, you can boot up an adventurer and find your fort on the world map. From there you can explore your old fort as if it was a dungeon, complete with loot and monsters. What appears in the fort is entirely dependent on your actions in Fortress mode; if your fort fell to a goblin siege then your adventurer will have to deal with goblins lurking in the halls. Likewise, items, especially artifacts created in Fortress mode, all persist in adventurer mode, allowing you to create full suits of armor and weapons that your adventurer can later find and equip.", 
      "Certainly the most popular aspect of this mode is the sheer absurdity of the things you can do in it. For instance, you may wish to take off your pants and use them to beat a child to death. You could then wield the child's corpse as a weapon and kill the grieving parents. Settings fires to bushes, throwing rocks at guards, and jumping into rivers to wrestle fish to death are all commonplace in Adventurer mode, and it's usually enough to make up for its rough and unfinished feel.", 
      "Legends mode does not fit the criteria of a traditional game; indeed, you don't control anything in it at all. Instead, Legends mode serves as a log of sorts for the entire history of the world you generated, from year 1 to when it stopped generating. In it you can read up on various historical figures (great warriors, kings, or even common folk) as well as read an event log describing various wars, nation expansion, and megabeast (dragons, giants, etc.) activity. You can also view historical maps and watch as civilizations expand as cities are created and destroyed.", 
      "Though seen as boring to some, many feel the entire purpose and intent of Dwarf Fortress is to create a generated world full of interesting stories. Legends mode allows you to keep track of all, and serves as link between both Fortress and Adventurer mode. For instance, you may lose your fortress to a certain goblin warlord. By using Legends mode you'd be able to look up the warlord, find out his lineage, how many wars he had been in, and where he currently rules from, and from there you can take an adventurer and seek out revenge.", 
      "Dwarf Fortress owes much of its popularity to the concept of succession forts. In these type of Let's Plays, a player will take control over a fortress for a year, having complete freedom in shaping its future however they want. After the year is up they zip up their save and send it to another player, who then controls the fortress for another year. These turns are often accompanied by detailed (and usually roleplayed) accounts of a player's year with the fortress, enumerating the many events a player might run into.", 
      "There is also the ability to edit the \"raw\" files of the game, enabling users to modify existing creatures, civilizations, items, weapons, and more. Users can also add brand new raw entries as they see fit, allowing the player to add or remove any object or creature as they see fit.",

      "\"What we've done is lay out a framework for version 1.0, and you just have a giant piece of paper with everything on it, and there's the stuff that's on the paper, and there's the stuff that's off the paper.\"", 
      "Although you can download and play the game for free right now, version 1.0 is still a long time coming. Tarn Adams recently estimated that we can expect 1.0 in around 20 years' time, although he admits it'll probably take even longer than that, \"because I always underestimate release times.\"", 
      "But the Adams brothers have a clear goal, regardless of timeframe. The duo recognize that they have gotten stuck in plenty of development ruts before, and their solution is to lay everything out in front of them, and decide on what will make the cut.", 
      "\"We try to stay on the paper as much as possible,\" says Adams. \"When we finish the paper, that's 1.0. And there's a whole lot more to do after that. I mean, obviously, if we're in our 50s, we'll have all kinds of life decisions we're making, so there's no reason to think that we'll stick with this plan for even another five years or whatever.\"", 
      "What's so intriguing (and perhaps questionable) about Adams' 30-year-plus plan is how exactly the designer can stay focused and enthused about a project that may potentially take up his entire adult life.", 
      "In fact, Adams says that he has around seven other big projects that are sort of in the works but not -- \"they are all sort of large undertakings that I don't have large undertaking time for,\" he says. \"There's time when we're watching stupid stuff on TV over at my brother's place where I have my other laptop, and I work on those games, just as kind of a break.\"", 
      "\"We don't really talk about them that much, and don't say what they are,\" he continues. \"We don't want to build any hype for them because it's not necessarily anything that's ever going to see the light of day. It helps, though, to know that we still have other ideas that we can work on, and there are lots of other interesting things to experiment with.\"", 
      "Adams says that whenever he becomes bored of a specific element of the game, he can simply go off and work on something else completely different instead. \"Like, if I got sick of geology, I wouldn't have to look at geology again for 10 years, right?\" he laughs. \"You can just go do something else.\"", 
      "But Adams isn't convinced that he'll make the 20 year deadline, regardless of dwindling enthusiasm or not. Sitting at his computer day-in, day-out (or night-in, night-out, as the case may be) is taking its toll on the developer -- plus it's not like he's able to control how the world will work in the coming decades.",

We'll put up all our dev notes, etcetera. But that's just idle speculation, right? That's the general idea.\"",

      "Regarding my academic background, I've always been good at math and followed a sort of path of least resistance, starting at my mathematics degree from the University of Washington through to my Stanford Ph.D. and into my postdoc at Texas A&M.  At that point I had to make a decision between games and math, since I wasn't talented enough to do those two things at once professionally and be responsible about it.  In any case, all the practice at mathematics has helped with game writing, since there are similar skills that come up with algorithms and with spatial considerations.",

      "Fortress Mode is the bulk of the game, and in that mode you guide a group of dwarven settlers as they carve their mines into whatever spot of the world map you've selected.  They face adversity from within the earth and from the outside world, and you also have to handle food, water, living arrangements, healthcare, and so on.  Lots of objects need to be made, both to further work and as treasures as ends in themselves or for trade, and you handle the supply chain and assign jobs.  The dwarves operate with a bit of autonomy, but they don't take a lot of initiative, and you tell them explicitly what tasks they are allowed to perform for the most part.  Adventure Mode is an incomplete RPG, and in Legends Mode you can look over the history of the world that was created, including the contributions from your Fortress and Adventure Mode games.", 
      "The idea now is to expand what we've got -- especially to get fortresses interacting more with the world and to get adventure mode standing on its own as a game.  Ideally you'd be able to play in more roles (a god, a human town, a group of bandits, a dragon, etc.), but that is a distant goal.", 
      "You have a game that seems firmly planted in the Tolkien style of high fantasy, and yet it contains code for tracking nervous tissue damage, the physics of weapon strikes, geologic processes for creating worlds, different geological layers of stone or soil and even simple genetics.  However, there are no languages, no writing, musical instruments but only as goods for trade, et cetera.  There's a well-described roadmap for Dwarf Fortress that includes these things, so what determined your priorities in implementing features?  How does the proper simulation of the production of nickel silver or steel relate to fantasy storytelling?", 
      "Ha ha, the production of nickel silver didn't come out of the desire to tell fantasy stories so much as it came out of the fact that mining is a huge and necessary part of Dwarf Fortress.  The priorities have been skewed heavily by that, compared to the last incarnation of our fantasy game (Slaves to Armok: God of Blood), which was only an (incomplete) RPG and so focused more on individual details (to our detriment in the end, since it was harder to expand from a game that was strictly bottom up).  There are several languages in the editable raw files, but it is a limited system.  In general, it's possible to get along for quite a while before literature etc. goes in, because it is less related to the most simple, exciting game mechanics, like combat and item production (which have received some attention).  At the same time, the grammar system, writing and books are on the \"short\" list of mechanics that are set to go in before many of the other version 1.0 goals, partially because our names have gotten fairly repetitive since we only have one form for noun phrases.", 
      "Overall, priorities are determined by what we want to see, what the community wants to see, what are required as stepping stones to handle those things, and sometimes just by whim.  Venom came in a bit early partially because we had recently seen a series of cheesy documentaries and really wanted to add compartment syndrome, though it is also a building block toward disease and \"curses\" for undeath and so on.", 
      "I think if you consider things like the Prisoner's Dilemma simulations and so on, you've at least got a tool worth looking at, but there must be enough being done that my opinion on the value of that sort of thing is pretty irrelevant by now anyway.  As long as a person's particular interest admits a model that can run on whatever computer resources they've got available, I think the process can be very instructive.  A running model can highlight interesting situations that arise from having so many pieces working together that you might not have been able to predict, and it can alert you to inconsistencies in your system.", 
      "You could look at Sim City or the Sims, say, and, sure, with some modification you could model some simple situation.  That's probably the boat our game is in.  There are some games that play with flocking behavior which could relate to some process or other, but those simulations existed by themselves beforehand as far as I know.  I'd be surprised if games arrive at decent models of complex socio-cultural processes before pure researchers, anyway, because game developers have other priorities in general, though we'll take some stabs at problems before academics can focus on them, just because they always come up.", 
      "Though there are graphics packages for Dwarf Fortress, the default display is ASCII.  Can you explain the practical reasons why you decided to use this for your display?  Why do you think the curses interface engenders such loyalty to a particular subsection of the gaming community?  Do you see representation of game elements using ASCII as a benefit or a drawback to representation of narrative?", 
      "The earlier game I mentioned, Slaves to Armok, was 3D (such as it was, anyway), and that slowed development quite a bit.  It's not just a matter of the time taken adding art to the game either -- 3D graphics can really constrain what you do fundamentally.  We wouldn't have the fluid simulation we do with any system that departs from a grid.  There's also matters of staff/copyright if you actually want to do a good job.  It's nice not to have to worry about any of that.", 
      "I don't think the curses interface engenders any extra loyalty--people really like their state-of-the-art 3D graphics when they have them as well.  DF's extended ASCII display has fans though.  It's partially being used to what is there, partially not wanting representations of game objects that make all the choices for you, partially legibility versus some of the tilesets and partially it has to do with traditions among Roguelike gamers, I guess, though everybody will be different.", 
      "Whether or not a narrative's representation is effective really depends on what sort of graphics an individual player prefers more than anything, and the time and care put into the narrative are going to matter a lot more than the particular methods used.  Even \"@...D\" can be evocative if you've been stoked with the proper context--it's the most terrifying D you can imagine.  At the same time, your imagination on the spot in situations like that is limited to what information you've been given coupled with the existing archetypes etc. in your head, and an artist's dragon could be something you wouldn't normally imagine, and that's great too.  To some extent, it depends on how much and in what way you want your escapism influenced by the artist, which is a matter of taste.  In Dwarf Fortress, I think the lack of a strict, fixed narrative lends itself a bit more to ASCII to me personally, but that can't be the basis for any kind of absolute judgment.  A player that prefers to use a 2D tileset or who wants 3D graphics would enjoy the game much more using those things in general and would become immersed in and enjoy whatever narratives are present all the more if they were using their favored graphics style, or at least a graphics style they can stomach!", 
      "The earlier version of Dwarf Fortress was known as 2D, because it included only one 'z-level' (meaning you dug into a mountainside and not deep into the ground, as you do in the current version).  You mentioned in an earlier interview that the 2D version was easier to \"script\" such that gameplay could parsed out based on how far into the mountain a player dug.  Can you describe the process of opening up new dimensions of gameplay (literally in the case of the z-axis, but also with the introduction of more complicated game mechanics including complex medical care) and trying to maintain some type of narrative?  Is there a tension between story and simulation?  Does the introduction of more simulation-oriented game mechanics require a looser narrative form or an entirely different one or just more planning?", 
      "Ideally in Dwarf Fortress, on the other hand, any fixed narrative is just a placeholder for a simulation which will produce a variety of stories.  That's optimistic, but there are a number of scripted events that have been dropped or loosened up as development has progressed. Of course, the stories are compelling as stories for the most only after they are glued together with some care in a player's mind and then in their forum retelling etc.  The game's Legends Mode just lists dry chronologies from which stories can be drawn, and in-game narrative is limited and stilted for the most part, as particular cookie-cutter conversations ensue or some actions happen on screen.  I've worked to improve the simulation to increase the variety and overall cohesion and verisimilitude, but it's not a fault that the player does a lot in their head to create a narrative that hangs together, even inventing non-existing me6chanics at times; that's part of what makes games great.  Some of my fondest gaming memories were when I didn't understand how the simulation worked and just went with it.  It can be similar to watching a magic trick being performed that way.", 
      "Extensive simulation can actually create a cleaner narrative in some ways.  A game with thousands of characters can track all of their relationships without creating a single plot hole or making similar mistakes.  Getting a simulation to produce a quality story in a single play-through that's comparable to something produced by an author is way off in dream land with computers as they are now though, at least without the player playing along as I mentioned earlier.", 
      "There have been times when your dwarfs have exhibited non-heteronormative behavior due to bugs, as well as designed behavior that runs counter to racial or ethnic stereotypes (and here I mean cultural assimilation between your classic fantasy \"races\" of goblins, dwarfs, elves and humans).  Broadly speaking, how is this tied to the world you're simulating and what's the tenor of player responses to this?  Have you been surprised by community response to this or other atypical mechanics of Dwarf Fortress and the gameplay elements attached to them (such as shield babies, mermaid farming, noble assassination, et cetera)?", 
      "I've been surprised by some of the specific instances of taking the game to the limits (the Turing complete water-based computer made from some 10000 objects, for example), but I remember the stuff I used to do in Ultima 7, so some of the macabre player behavior comes as no surprise, ha ha ha.  The responses to designed atypical elements has been positive for the most part as far as I can tell.  There are any number of camps on various issues (should gunpowder be added?  etc. etc.), and opinions are all over the place.  Experienced players can turn some of the features off if they don't like them (like the cultural assimilation you mentioned), and I provide options like that when I can easily do so.", 
      "There's a lot of roughness to the game, and people pretty much take it in stride and have fun with it when possible, although the ones I can see are the ones that haven't left in disgust, ha ha ha.  While there's still so much left to add, especially at a basic level, it can be counterproductive to try to polish anything too much.  I wouldn't be shocked if the game were sort of rough forever, and just enjoyable to those that enjoy it for what it is, but I've said that I'd like to head toward a more polished state as I finish the version 1.0 goals and that's still the plan.", 
      "Similarly, Dwarf Fortress has been described as modeling a communist utopia slowly (and sometimes suddenly) replaced by an autocratic dictatorship.  Where does political theory fit into your world of functional alcoholics?  Is there a particular political reality that you're working to represent or is this a sign of the community organizing their own explanation of game mechanics?", 
      "The situation you described comes more or less out of a single triggered event (the arrival of a Baron, or in the latest version, the option to recommend a dwarf for elevation to that status).  The game isn't specifically designed as a criticism of Marxism or colonialism or even feudalism, though our simulation decisions and priorities will inevitably reflect our biases, upbringing, worldview, etc.  The hope is to drive as much as possible of what develops, during world generation and beyond, through individual actions, even to the extent that it creates the larger political situation.  Where that goal is complicated or virtually impossible for us we'll continue to rely on civilization and group-level decisions that come out of the definitions in the text files (which specify cultural information, though there is some randomly generated information there, and that trend will continue).  The current fixed cultural definitions are vaguely aligned with common fantasy races and they each have their own rough political systems but building up a stock universe isn't our ultimate goal, so decisions made there shouldn't be given too much significance.  The immediate goal there was to provide us with some variety to work with.", 
      "The question of commons-based peer collaboration is brought up in the Dwarf Fortress community regularly, and you've made it clear that you don't plan to open the sourcecode of the game for collaborative effort.  There are also a number of third-party tools, visualizers and even interface code that you've shown support for.  How do you think all of this reflects the current state of the proprietary vs. free software debate?  What role does the community play in the development of this game?  Where do you see yourself in the game development continuum?", 
      "I don't know about the state of the larger debate, but for our project, we basically want people to be able to do what they like to the extent that it doesn't put us at financial risk.  We've been feeling around in the dark on that from the beginning pretty much though.  I can't say what would happen to me if the entire source were released, but it seems reckless enough that I'm sticking with the status quo.  If we were financially secure, the Dwarf Fortress code would likely be released.", 
      "Members of the community make suggestions, thoroughly test the game, find bugs, manage the bug tracker, contribute technical code, support the development financially through donations and word of mouth, help newcomers with their questions and give them a place to hang out and share stories and information, write articles for the wiki, host and produce and provide music and transcripts for the podcast, and I'm sure there are lots of things I'm forgetting.  They are the reason I've been able to make the step from hobbyist to full-time developer.", 
      "As far as the game development continuum goes, there are more and more people working now that are able to remain afloat making the games they want to make, and I think it's pretty cool.  Many people that go into the game industry end up in fairly soul-crushing environments and eventually switch professions.  I'm lucky to be able to run with whatever ideas we have and try new things.  There are any number of other ways to classify myself among the other game developers, but that's the most important thing to me.", 
      "Are there any particular works on history or sociology that have influenced the manner in which you're modeling culture, society and politics?", 
      "My brother studied ancient history, and we have a ton of history books around that have heavily influenced our priorities (like the Twelve Caesars or the translations of the writings of the Assyrian kings), but there aren't more theoretical books that we've tried to model specifically as starting points.  When I'm trying to model some system or other, I generally try to get down to individual elements that I can use, since that'll lead to the richest simulation outcomes, even if I don't have control over the larger behavior.  Using a good, sensible set of individual elements will generally keep the larger behavior more or less within bounds, though you might have to control it for whatever reason (as with caps to avoid memory trouble).  The searches basically start at google, wikipedia and relevant sites suggested by the community and move on to specific sources from there if necessary, but I mostly just collect lists or individual simple processes I can make sense of, without paying too much attention to the general conclusions since I'm not going to be able to and don't want to align the many mechanics with sweeping statements (that might be questionable or out of date).", 
      "For instance, when we were researching crime for some later additions, we found that the systems that dealt with individual motivations had processes and variables that were more easily adapted to the game than systems that dealt with class struggle or other large-group considerations, simply because the individual is the game's principle unit of consideration, even if we agreed more with the broader conclusions of systems we couldn't use in many cases.  As long as an individual mechanic makes sense, the ideology of the overall system is irrelevant, and it'll be intriguing to see what comes out of it.  It would be funny if an off-kilter reactionary individual-based model gave rise to off-kilter radical group-based behavior, but that'll have to wait for a pure simulation.  Dwarf Fortress is always going to be cobbled together from whatever makes sense at the time.  I took my current 30 personality facets from the NEO PI-R test, for instance, without having much knowledge of the theory.  If it fits in to the game, makes sense to me and provides enough diversity to be reasonably resilient to future changes, I can use it.  On the other hand, the ethics list we have came out of what was necessary for existing game elements and might expand incrementally in that way for a while before I settle on a more formal treatment, if I ever do."

      "Things aren’t going as planned. The digital corpses of my bushy-eyebrowed avatar are piling up around me. They have different names – the mighty, high-score-owning paladin Steve, Ted the vampire, Dumbledore, the short-lived wizard. I am sleepless and restless, hurling adventurer after adventurer into the cavernous depths of Lord Dredmor’s dungeon. Surrounded by this binary carnage, I am reluctant to again enter the fray – but I can’t resist. I click New Game without trepidation, the sweet smell of bloodshed and loot making my stomach rumble.", 
      "Hank the Axeman sets forth towards the dark lord himself – but it’ll be a while before they meet, if they ever do. This particular iteration of the dungeon hurls me into a room full of bats – not the dreaded monster zoo, but close enough – and I panic, retreating. The bats pursue. Hank’s dual axes loose themselves, Fleshsmithing buffs are hurled, but it is in vain.", 
      "Hank is dead. Not videogame dead – actually dead. There is finality in Hank’s death, if nothing else.", 
      "Staring at the game over screen, I realize that Hank is a new low, the quickest death yet. I am once again staring at the main menu.", 
      "I click New Game without hesitation.", 
      "I set out to make a new character. Alfred is a spry archer who sports a fedora hat. We hurl ourselves into the dungeon together, and I devote myself to being especially attentive this time. I scrutinize the game’s gorgeous-cum-nostalgic graphics, parsing them for traps, predicting enemy movement patterns. I am no roguelike veteran, but I’m learning. Alfred, or Al, as I call him, hurls arrows into bats and robots and Grim Reapers from a far, baiting them into the Lord of Dredmor’s own traps. He backpedals relentlessly, hurling softballs and bombs as he goes, effortlessly disarming traps that he can’t avoid.", 
      "It is also with Alfred that I discover my first monster zoo.", 
      "He was minding his own business, making sure all the loot was mopped out on the current floor. We were inspecting the far eastern wing, having just visited the shop (run by a Pig-faced, checkered-suit wearing demon thing, nonetheless) and with a pocketful of cash and an empty inventory. Alfred found an unopened door and flung it open with glee – only to find forty monsters waiting to eat me alive. Genies, zombies, weird gooey things; a whole cavalcade. I was grossly outnumbered, slightly short on food and potions – but resolved to fight. I loosed arrows, raining holy death down on the army in front of me. Dodging traps, ducking this way and that – Alfred became death incarnate.", 
      "Five breathless minutes later, I was rewarded with my first cleared zoo, a shit-ton of loot, and a level up. The Lord of Dredmor’s vast horde had suffered significant losses at the hands of Alfred’s crossbow. I had braved the game’s too-small text, its usable-but-still clunky UI. I had killed and killed. I was victorious.", 
      "It was time to plunge deeper. I move calmly down the steps into the dark reaches of floor three.",

    ], 
    "http://www.examiner.com/article/dungeons-of-dredmor-interview": [
      "1.  Please tell us a little bit about yourself and your role with the development of Dungeons of Dredmor.", 
      "N.: I’m Nicholas Vining; I’m responsible for nearly all of the programming on Dredmor, and a good chunk of the game design.", 
      "CD: I’m Daniel Jacobsen, and I’ve been in charge of a fair chunk of the early gameplay code, which has been painstakingly made more exciting by Mr. Baumgart.  I am also supposedly responsible for the game being inundated with lutefisk, and I handle the general business stuff (paperwork) on behalf of the studio.", 
      "DGB: I’m David Baumgart and I’m Gaslamp’s art team. I’ve also done a lot of game mechanics and content creation for Dredmor.", 
      "N.: I’ve been in the game industry since 2000; my first job out of high school was working for the now-defunct Loki Software, porting games to Linux. Since then I’ve been in and out of the industry for the past eleven years, and have worked on a bunch of “AAA” and “less-than AAA” titles. It’s been a … checkered career.", 
      "DGB: My first attempts at game development began while I was in college and carried on through a couple major projects there, though nothing particularly serious resulted. After graduating, I started doing freelance graphics work for games at the end of 2007 and worked on a stream of indie, mobile, browser, and online games ever since.", 
      "CD: Nicholas called me up one day, asked me if I knew C++, and we had a cup of coffee.  He had some crazy ideas about starting a game company, and the technology he was talking about interested me enough that I figured even if we never made a cent, it would be a fun way to spend some evenings.  Little did I know how many evenings it would be.", 
      "3.  Where did the idea for Dungeons of Dredmor come from?", 
      "N.: When I started the project, I was heavily into Dungeon Crawl at the time. I wanted to come up with something that would be a little more accessible for people; it seemed like there was a good market opportunity for a roguelike that people could play with the mouse instead of the keyboard, and which could be played graphically with animations. The strange stuff came later. We’re still not sure where those ideas came from. Caffeine abuse, probably.", 
      "4.  What are some of the successes and failures you learned from in developing Dungeons of Dredmor?", 
      "CD: We are all pretty comfortable at this point calling Dredmor a success.  There are still some issues to sort out, and we are by no means finished adding fun stuff to the title, but the fact that it’s a success makes it easy to look back on what we did that worked out, and more difficult to say what didn’t.", 
      "I think we’re all very happy with the way that the attention to detail has been received.  It often seems assumed that there are fairly diminishing returns on the depth to the content in a game which gives them character.  We all like playing games with loads of character: this medium isn’t just about gameplay mechanic.  It’s very important, but without a feel, a texture, a game is no more than mastering arbitrary rules.  So we think that spending the time to attempt to capture that has been well worth it.", 
      "DGB: The majority of games I’ve contracted for have never seen the light of day and by all rights Dredmor shouldn’t have either — but we’re terrifically stubborn.", 
      "We came in to the project thinking we could overhaul Dredmor in a month or two and launch it to make some quick cash to fund another project. That was three years ago. This short-term strategy extended to the long term and probably hurt us both in terms of inflexible design and code which made future changes to the game more work than they had to be. I believe Nicholas can speak at length about “technical debt”.", 
      "5.  In its current form, how close is Dungeons of Dredmor to your initial vision?", 
      "N.: In some ways, very close. In other ways, not at all. I don’t think anybody imagined the Diggles, or the magic skill trees, or anything else when we started. In fact, the game originally had classes and things, more like Dungeon Crawl, but they were rapidly left on the cutting room floor, as it were.", 
      "The actual game mechanics – walk to click, the way that you interact with the game via the mouse – all of that has been pretty much set in stone from Day One. The tile rendering code is some of the oldest code in the game.", 
      "DGB: Dredmor had been kicking around Nicholas’ development backburners for a few years before the project was brought into Gaslamp’s focus. The initial vision was definitely his, but it’s been run through quite a few radical re-imaginings. The version of Dredmor introduced to us by Nicholas did not display any visible numbers for items or player statistics, for instance, and it’s clearly a far cry from the crunchy statistics screen now in the game. Still, we’ve tried to keep to the spirit that one should not have to pay much mind to the numbers — well, when playing on the easiest difficulty level at least.", 
      "6.  Please talk about developing the art style, level design and music for Dungeons of Dredmor.", 
      "DGB: When I first saw the partly-developed game it was in a rough state, artistically speaking. I considered all the assets and divided them into piles of what I would redo and what I would keep and try to adapt my art style to fit. The best parts were the animated sprites drawn by Bryan Rathman and Tim Wexford, so those formed the basis for everything else, which I redraw: items, tilesets, user interface, icons, spell effects.", 
      "One of the larger struggles was coming in to the game with what Nicholas considered to be a complete rendering system. I had to fit new graphics over all the old pieces, and not necessarily in ways I was happy with. Dredmor’s original, archaic sprite format was particularly frustrating as it required that I used software that felt like it was from the last millennium rather than my native Photoshop. Happily, my griping finally convinced Nicholas to overhaul Dredmor to support modern pngs. Incidently, this will make life easy for modders when we get around to implementing mod support.", 
      "The comic-like icons and paintings of the hero character probably came from my dabbling in drawing comics; back in college I did a monthly comic for the student newspaper, and even throughout highschool I’d draw comics on the sly in pretty much every class.  The music was all done by Matthew Steele with direction more or less from Nicholas, who is himself a musician.", 
      "7.  Some developers admitted their games were too hard upon release because they became experts as they developed the game.  Talk about setting the difficulty levels for Dungeons of Dredmor and if you faced a similar challenge.", 
      "N.: We have the reverse problem. Honestly, I can’t even beat the thing any more.", 
      "CD: I beat it once, about six months ago, just to make sure that the end-game stuff was working properly.  It took me hours, and it was not nearly as tricky as it is now.  That said, there are more than a few people who have tackled it already.  Our fans are dungeon delving fiends!", 
      "DGB: Our late-stage beta testers are the ones that really started outpacing us, but we had a mix of player skill level through from relatively casual players to hardcore number-crunching Roguelike veterans. Having three levels of difficulty has turned out to be a very good move, I think – I balanced the medium level for myself, the easy for casual players, and hard for hardcore players.", 
      "8.   Were there any challenges you faced in ensuring Dungeons of Dredmor would run on the various PC system configurations?", 
      "N.: Surprisingly, things have been pretty good so far. We ran a reasonably large open beta and that shook everything out pretty well; all that has been left are a few crashes which nobody ever managed to find in a month, but which reared their ugly heads after release.  Maintaining save game compatibility across multiple Dredmor versions has turned out to be a hassle, but we’re learning to deal with it.", 
      "9.  Outside of creating the game itself, what is the toughest aspect of being an indie developer?", 
      "DGB: The nearly-zero capital bootstrap startup has been a very rough experience. There’s poverty, working an extra unpaid job, and everyone around you thinking you might be making a huge mistake. Three years later, I can finally, deliciously, say “I was right”. I’m telling this to myself too, I should add.", 
      "10.  Tell us about your relationship with Valve.  How did making Dungeons of Dredmor available via Steam come about?  Also talk about process of creating Steam Achievements.", 
      "DGB: To speak about achievements – those are easy. These were largely thought up in the course of an evening or two of sitting back and saying “wouldn’t it be cool if we had an achievement for X?”, filling out a list, then seeing what is actually any good the next day when we have our senses about us.  And drawing the little pictures for them is fun. They’re all like a one-panel comic with a little gag or an interesting composition to play with.", 
      "11.  Did you research similar titles when trying to come up with the launch price for Dungeons of Dredmor?", 
      "CD: We tried.  Really, we did.  The truth is that there’s not really anything *quite* like Dredmor out there, and fewer titles still that have sales stats available with which to make informed decisions.  The pricing structure of Dredmor was never a case of attempting to go lower than a particular game.  We spent hours debating the pricing model.  What it really came down to was deciding on the point at which we felt that, basically, halving the price would no longer more than double the number of people who would purchase it.", 
      "This decision was also pretty heavily influenced by Steam.  Ten or fifteen years ago when there were fewer gamers and the product had to be produced physically, there was so much overhead that you could not make money on a game for five bucks.  Back then most buyers were old school gamers that were comfortable paying ten times that for games with archaic UIs and fifty page manuals because they were accustomed to it.  That market is dying as expectations increase even among older gamers.  People expect a lot out of a five dollar game now, and they expect a level of sophistication out of a fifty dollar game that is just not tractable for a company that started in a basement with carpet on the walls – not as a first product anyway.  We weren’t looking to compete with them, but rather give people an entertaining diversion at a price that would seem agreeable to most potential buyers, and eventually surprise them enough that they would tell their friends.", 
      "DGB: Going with the $5 pricepoint almost certainly would not have worked if we had not landed the Steam deal.", 
      "12.  How do you feel about the digital distribution platform as a whole?", 
      "DGB: It’s wonderful, digital distribution makes markets accessible with a low investment threshold. This is perfect for indie game developers trying to establish themselves. Launching Dungeons of Dredmor could never have happened in a traditional retail/investor driven environment; It’s just too weird a game.", 
      "13.  As of this interview, (7-21-11) please tell us why there is no PC demo available for Dungeons of Dredmor.", 
      "DGB: It came down to a tradeoff between improving the game itself and making a demo. We encouraged beta testers to freely talk about their experiences in forums, make youtube videos, share live streams of gameplay, and post screenshots so that the general public would better be able to understand what Dredmor is about and if it is worth their time. Speaking of worth, the low price makes it an easier sell too.", 
      "I concede that it would be good and proper practice to have made a demo, but our resources are limited so at this point we’d rather have Nicholas fixing crashes and adding features. This doesn’t rule out the possibility of releasing a demo in the future, of course.  It’s possible that many people are using pirated copies of the game as a demo; at least one customer admitted this much to us.", 
      "14.  How important is it to get instant feedback about Dungeons of Dredmor from users through online message boards and other social networking sites?", 
      "CD: Crucial.  We attribute much (if not all) of the success the game has had to listening to our fans.  Message boards, twitter posts, and blogs give us the tools to open dialogue with our fans with very little effort on their behalf.  When you build games like these, you can’t just build the game that you want to play.  The key is in merging that idea with that of your audience, and without these tools, that would be almost impossible.", 
      "15.  How much value do you place on the opinions of those who review Dungeons of Dredmor professionally?", 
      "DGB: I believe that professional reviewers are gamers at heart and that we’ve made a gamer’s game. I also believe that indie games have earned themselves a sense of legitimacy in the last few years which means that Dredmor will be taken seriously by reviewers and judged for what it is. This is of course important because professional reviewers play an important role in sales.  Further, more personally, I follow a particular few reviewers as critics and it is important to me to be judged as a worthwhile game developer by them.", 
      "All that said, we can already call Dungeons of Dredmor a success due to the incredible response from our beta testers and early adopters. We’ve managed to make it despite having relatively little attention from professional gaming press before release.", 
      "16.  How do you feel about the Humble Indie Bundle and “Pay What You Want Pricing”? Would you be interested in contributing to a project like that in the future?", 
      "DGB: I believe we’ve had contact with them in some capacity already. They do great work and we’d love to be a part of it.", 
      "17.  What are your thoughts on how the PC gaming industry as a whole are dealing with the problem of intrusive DRM and piracy?", 
      "DGB: We don’t use customer-punishing DRM because we acknowledge its futility, particularly for a company in our context. The best DRM can do is inconvenience pirates, the worst it can do is ruin a legitimate customer’s experience. Pirates will either pay for our game or they won’t, there’s little use stressing about it. And so long as it’s not our bandwidth they’re taking, we’re not necessarily losing anything — and they’re essentially giving us publicity.  And maybe this works for a startup with no marketing budget.", 
      "18.  How do you feel about DLC and its current implementation in the PC gaming industry?", 
      "DGB: I’m not a fan of paid DLC and I don’t recall that I’ve ever purchased any paid DLC. It feels like one receives a lot less for their dollar than in the expansion pack model from previous decades, though I concede that traditional retail-driven expansion packs are obsolete in the face of nearly ubiquitous digital distribution. So I imagine that paid DLC can be used legitimately but I have not yet come across a situation where I’ve felt the desire to purchase any.", 
      "In terms of Dredmor, it might well have been a better business strategy to be pushing paid DLC, but we’ve made a commitment to providing free content updates. Anything we will charge for will have to significantly change gameplay to fit the definition of “expansion” rather than DLC, I think.", 
      "19.  What are some of the games or genres you like to play?  Are you a fan of other developers?", 
      "DGB: Though the direction of AAA games has left me cold in recent years, I’m a huge fan of ridiculously complex simulation/strategy like Dwarf Fortress, Dominions 3, and games by Paradox Interactive. I go back and play lots of old favourites from the late 90’s and early 00’s. I especially like id Software and Valve’s catalogs.", 
      "NV: Dwarf Fortress, old Japanese RPGs, some 4X strategy games… I think we all have fairly similar tastes, which helps. I don’t think we’ll be making a first person shooter set in an American military theatre any time soon.", 
      "CD: Huge fan of tactical RPGs like Disgaea and Final Fantasy: Tactics.  I love real-time and turn-based strategy games, and I do a lot of pen & paper RPG playing as well.", 
      "20.  What advice would you give up-and-coming indie PC developers who are trying to break into the business?", 
      "DGB: To someone wanting to get into game development there are a few insanity checks that need to be passed: You need to love making games, not just playing games. You need to realize that games are not just the stories in games. You need to realize that your skills, if adequate, could earn you a lot more money in other fields. You need to have interests outside of games lest your design sensibilities become inbred. You need to be able to make yourself finish projects without outside motivation. I could go on like this and sound pretty negative, but if you love making games enough to overcome all of it, you’ll probably be doing it anyway.", 
      "NV: Build a work ethic. Shipping video games is hard, and the only way you *can* ship a video game is by forcing yourself to do it, tuning out all distractions, and getting it done. This is a very, very hard skill that great developers have. (John Carmack is particularly legendary for this.) It’s hard work, but at the end of the day, despite the amount of effort required and the emotional rollercoaster having your work out there can be, it’s very rewarding.", 
      "Also, playtest the heck out of things. I’m a big fan of Valve’s iterated software development methodology for game development, and we’ll be looking more towards doing that in the future.", 
      "CD: Like just about anything, you need to love the work.  Find a way where you can pay the bills and enjoy putting in your time every day, and any success that comes your way is a bonus."

      "Robb recently asked a fairly simple question on the main site:", 
      "I dropped a quick answer down there detailing what I recommended as an “easy” build, but thought I’d use this opportunity to go in to a little bit more detail and discuss which skills do and don’t work well for a beginner, why, and what skills to look at next.", 
      "A new player, by simple virtue of being new, doesn’t fully understand the game mechanics. In a game like Dredmor, where the mechanics can be complicated and are often brutal, it is best for a new player to have the most streamlined experienced possible.", 
      "Once they’ve got the hang of the mechanics of the game, they can start to branch out into the more interesting abilities – those that add further mechanics to learn. It’s simply a case of not being overloaded at the start of the game. This means that a build that relies on magic is relatively difficult to start with as the player has to learn what spells do what and how to manage their magical power, so we’ll be looking at combat as a good starting point.", 
      "The other obvious factor is that whatever we select should also help the player as much as possible – a useless passive skill might not overload the player with mechanics to learn, but will also make the game harder for them by wasting a skill slot.", 
      "So, an easy build is one that contains skills that are powerful or useful from level 1, don’t require a lot of prior knowledge to use and don’t require too much micromanagement. I think I can come up with something that meets these requirements.", 
      "First, every combat build needs a weapon. Ranged weapons require too much management of ammo etc, Staves don’t do enough damage (and we’d be wasting their magic buffs) and unarmed combat is just too difficult to start with.", 
      "Next, we want to accentuate the damage done by your weapons as best possible. There’s a few great skills to do this, and I recommend the following two:", 
      "That’s damage sorted, now we need to look at defence. There are two good passive options here, and I recommend them both for the easier build, although pay attention to my comments on what armour to take in the next section, else you risk wasting these.", 
      "With combat sorted, there’s one utility skill that I’d also recommend picking up.", 
      "So, there we have it. This build is mace wielding and combat-centric, but has so many passive boosts and buffs that it really is quite strong in combat from the start without being confusing, allowing the newbie player to make reasonable progress with little experience of the game – although please be aware that this isn’t the strongest build out there, but I think it is the strongest you can get while keeping it simple.", 
      "Of course any build is useless if you just use that wooden club or sword that you start with, and learning what equipment is available is part of the fun of the game, but here’s some quick generalised advice.", 
      "Here’s a few other skills that I consider to be quite strong while remaining quite “easy” to manage:", 
      "The following two require much more management, but are still definitely worth a look.", 
      "Skills are difficult to choose without prior knowledge because they stick with your character until death, and a bad selection can completely block any chance of success in a game that can be unexpectedly brutal at times. Hopefully, this build and other skills I’ve discussed here will give you the smoothest start possible in to the game.", 
      "However, once you’ve got the hang of things, try branching out and playing with as many different skills as possible – I haven’t even touched on ranged or magic builds here, let along the numerous interesting and strange combinations you can put together.", 
      "An interesting skill combination can reinvigorate the game by requiring a new set of tactics and provide a new challenge. So, please, don’t take this as the One Build™ that should be used at all times, otherwise you risk finding the game to be much less interesting than it really is and missing out on its full potential.",

      "I’m an artist, right? Right. I draw using my computer pretty much all the time. It’s what I do. Drawing (or ‘digital painting’ or ‘pixeling’ or whatever it is) doesn’t particularly engage the part of my brain that involves language unless I’m actually doing higher-level design. A lot of it is just painting away at something or pushing a lot of pixels. Oftentimes it’s not supremely engaging stuff like drawing lots and lots of bricks or painting lots and lots of clouds – all good and necessary things, yes, but the mind tends to wander. So I listen to stuff. Music works oftentimes, and the emotional content of the music often finds its way in to my art. Other times I want to listen to something I can think about, something relevant to what I’d like to be doing: game design.",

(Beta testers: if you’re on WINE, you can try the Linux build too! Dump everything out of your Steam install with WINE, and you should be able to just run “./Dredmor”, a little shell script which autoselects the correct build, x86 or amd64. You may have to chmod +x some files, I’m not sure.) The Changelog is still as posted, with the exception of the addition of some additional support for the WASD controls (which now break more things, open more things, flip more things, and are generally more useful than ever before) and correct proc assignment to crossbows (if you have a crossbow with Thaumites, only your crossbow will shoot Thaumites.)",

Embrace your destiny! Face evil of the likes the world has never known - the terrifying Swarmies, the undulating Thrusties, and the adoreable nest-building Diggles. Wield shoes decorated by the Dwarven Glittersmiths, all of whom have now committed suicide because of their shame, and embrace the joys of destroying giant moustache-wielding brick demons with a mace decorated with tawdry, delicious bacon.\n\nWhile you’re at it, be prepared to die.

We set out to retain those two aspects in the new arrangements to the best of our ability.  In terms of my work as a composer, I wanted to capture something of the texture of the music we remember from the NES and Super Nintendo era.  If that comes across to the listener, I couldn't be happier.", 
      "For Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, The Maiden and the Five Heroes, the approach to sound design has remained the same as on previous titles.  Because the game is for the Nintendo DS, it was necessary to strip some of the sound effects from the Wii version down to their component parts to recreate them using less data on the DS.  This is an entirely new game, so the graphics are improved over the original title, and we have been studying the storyboards to reflect that increase in quality in the sound design.  Judging my own work, I would say that my skills have improved with time.  All of us at the studio have been working to match the visual design team's high standards of quality.",

In this handheld sequel, The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds continues this tale – while bringing some unique new elements to the fore.",

In the past, it may have been tricky to tell the difference between different floor levels, but now they are crystal clear, giving more realism to battle sequences and dungeon exploration!", 
      "When you play The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, you’ll not only encounter deadly dungeons and the usual epic landscapes of the series, but incredible puzzles to test your brain.

Dungeons sink deep below the screen as Link and his attacks pop out, highlighting the nonstop action. The pace is faster than ever, especially since you can swap items on the Nintendo 3DS touch screen. Shoot an arrow, toss a boomerang, bomb a wall, then merge into a painting to slide between two worlds — all in a matter of seconds.

      "I have a love-hate relationship with procedurally generated content.", 
      "That’s the problem with procedural content. Done well, it can hide its formulaic nature for a while. But eventually, even the best procedural content feels mechanically stamped-out… because it is. But when done poorly, it looks and feels utterly meaningless. It’s an infinite supply of boring filler. There’s an art and science to making good procedural content, and I think it works best when mixed with carefully hand-crafted content.", 
      "Pondering this, it occurs to me that there are really two approaches to procedural content – runtime vs. design-time. Run-time procedural content means the computer generates the content for the end-user directly, using whatever formulas and building blocks the developers have plugged into the system. For highly replayable games, with a new randomized world every time you play, this is the way a game must go.", 
      "The trick here is that procedural content is not a ‘cheap replacement’ for carefully hand-crafted content. Up until a point, it’ll actually cost significantly more to develop than the equivalent hand-crafted custom content. What procedural content gives you is ease of re-use. It scales better. It also gives the programmers something creative and fun to do…", 
      "I think games – mainstream and especially indie – are going to be more and more dependent upon procedural content as time goes by. If nothing else, it can be useful for fleshing out little details in the game to make things interesting, so that things don’t have that overwhelmingly canned, pre-scripted feel, or to fill in unimportant but interesting details. As a guy who tends to fall in love with more “simulationist” worlds, I love the idea of a world being at least partially built by the actors with whom I am interacting in-game, particularly when they interact with the world in a way that seems clever and unexpected."

      "These games lacked the sort \r\nof user friendliness that would have made them accessible to a larger audience. In any case, \r\nmany gamers didn't relish the idea of learning one role-playing system just to abandon it when \r\nthe next game came out.", 
      "The new game would be a commercial endeavor from the start, targeted at a larger audience. \r\nGarriott teamed up his friend and coworker Ken Arnold (nicknamed \"Sir Kenneth\") to create a \r\ntile-based graphics system reminiscent of a miniatures tabletop, which requires much less \r\nstorage space and allows for large, colorful environments.", 
      "Perhaps what impressed gamers and critics more than the graphics was the truly \r\nepic size of the game. Indeed, rather than limit itself to one time period, the setting moves from \r\nthe Middle Ages to the Space Age. There's even a sequence featuring first-person perspective \r\nspace flight and combat! Critics marveled at how characters starting off with maces and other \r\ncrude weapons ended the game with phazors and blasters.", 
      "There are also several nice twists, \r\nsuch as monsters (gelatinous cubes) that destroy armor and others that take the character's \r\nfood. As with the previous game, food is a serious and constant concern. However, if the \r\ncharacter dies, the player can try to resurrect him. The only problem here is that the character \r\nmight materialize on a water tile and be unable to move away -- an infuriating bug.", 
      "The game also handles hit points in an unusual way. Instead of regenerating by \r\nresting or healing, the character must either buy hit points from the king or receive them as he \r\nleaves dungeons. Of course, if the player runs out of hit points, the character dies and must be \r\nresurrected. I'm not sure the system makes much logical sense, but it didn't seem to arouse \r\nmuch disdain from critics.", 
      "Of course, a sensible distribution depends on the choice of type, or class: fighter, cleric, wizard, \r\nor thief. There are four races to choose from, one being hobbits -- perhaps a nod to Tolkien. \r\nWe'll see this point distribution system show up in many later games, though it's unclear if it's \r\nreally an improvement over the more traditional model based on rolling three six-sided dice.", 
      "The game was originally available only for the Apple II+, though ports followed for \r\nthe Atari 8-bit computers in 1983. In 1986, the game was rewritten in assembly language and \r\nupdated with better graphics and a few other small changes. This version was ported to the \r\nCommodore 64, MS-DOS, and MSX platforms and is more familiar to most gamers than the \r\noriginal.", 
      "It also features a tactical, turn-based combat \r\nsystem with strict time limits (if a player takes too long to move a character, the game \r\nautomatically skips to the next character or monster's turn). There are 16 hand-to-hand and \r\nranged weapons, eight armor types, and 32 magic spells with names inspired by Latin.", 
      "One \r\nunusual and somewhat frustrating aspect of the combat system is that only the character \r\nstriking the deathblow gets any experience points for the battle -- a fact that can quickly lead to \r\na severely unbalanced party. Garriott also reworked the scenes involving sea travel, introducing \r\na ship-to-shore combat system and wind navigation. To top it all off, the Garriott added a \r\ndynamic musical score that changes with various settings, though Apple II owners needed the \r\noptional Mockingboard expansion card to hear it.", 
      "The storyline is rather typical and avoids the sci-fi elements that played such an \r\nimportant role in the first two games. Simply put, the player must seek out and kill an evil \r\noverlord, this time one named Exodus. Exodus is the offspring of Mondain and Minax and has \r\nbeen terrorizing the land of Sosaria with no regard for diplomacy.", 
      "Solving the game requires \r\nseeking out the mysterious Time Lord and working out the secrets of the Moon Gates. It isn't \r\nenough just to build up a strong party, though -- players must interact with townspeople to \r\ngather enough clues to solve a series of puzzles.", 
      "Creating a group rather a single character leads to a much different gameplay \r\ndynamic, since players have to carefully balance their parties to ensure that they have the right \r\ncombination of skills necessary to complete the ten-level dungeon.", 
      "In other words, players are \r\nrequired to make many important decisions before gameplay commences; the character \r\ncreation process is long, involved, and of paramount importance. A few poor selections can \r\neasily make the game extremely difficult, if not unwinnable. Many less experienced gamers \r\nwere no doubt overwhelmed by the whole process. We'll return to the \"party versus single hero \r\nissue\" later.", 
      "Further complicating the party issue are four elite classes, which are more or less \r\nhybrids of the four basic classes: bishop (priest/mage), samurai (fighter/mage), lord \r\n(fighter/priest), and ninja (fighter/thief). The ninja is similar to what many later games would call \r\nthe monk, a fighter that shuns weapons and armor and excels at critical strikes.", 
      "The magic system is also fairly elaborate, with some 50 total spells for priests and \r\nmages. Perhaps as a tactic to ensure that players purchased a legal copy of the game, these \r\nspells can only be cast by entering their names -- printed in the manual, of course.", 
      "Although \r\nmost of the spells are combat-related, a few are useful in other ways. For example, the mage \r\nspell \"DUMAPIC\" reveals the player's current position in the maze relative to the stairs leading \r\nout of the maze, and \"MALOR,\" if cast in camp, will teleport the party to a precise location. The \r\nmagic system uses a special spell point system involving slots for each level of spell. These \r\npoints can only be replenished by resting in The Castle.", 
      "The dungeons are arranged on a 20 x 20 grid, which makes them ideal \r\nfor mapping onto graph paper. Since the dungeons are fixed rather than random, players could \r\nreally benefit from having a good map laid before them. The map offers detailed instructions on \r\nmaking such a map and lets player know that \"mapping is indeed one of the most important \r\nskills that successful Wizardry players possess.\"", 
      "They converted \r\nthe game to PASCAL, a decision that it made it much easier to port the game to other platforms \r\nlater on. Unfortunately, PASCAL programs required 48 K of RAM to operate, and Apple II \r\nneeded an optional RAM expansion called a Language Card to run them.", 
      "It wasn't until 1979 \r\nthat Apple introduced the Apple II+, which came preequipped with the required 48 KB of RAM. \r\nIn short, Greenberg and Woodhead were at least a year ahead of the technology and had to \r\nwait for gamers and the computer industry to catch up with them.", 
      "Unfortunately, this problem has yet to be solved, and CRPG fans and \r\ndevelopers have long been divided on the issue. Currently, the industry seems to have settled \r\non the single-hero model; of the top three CRPGs currently available, none is party-based. We'll \r\nreturn to this critical issue throughout the book.", 
      "Davalpus slew the royal family except for Princess Margda and \r\nPrince Alavik, who used the staff and the armor of the Knight of Diamonds to battle the usurper. \r\nAlavik was not successful, however, and after the battle all that was left was a \"smoking hole in \r\nthe ground.\"", 
      "It's the player's mission, of course, to get back the staff, but that will mean first \r\nprocuring all five pieces of the fabled armor. To complicate matters, each of these pieces is a \r\nliving being that must be defeated in combat. As expected, solving the game means plunging \r\ninto a dungeon (this time one with only six levels) and battling whatever beasts stand in the \r\nway.", 
      "However, there is an elaborate rite of passage ceremony by \r\nwhich the new characters can receive a blessing from their ancestors (a boost in stats and \r\nskills). Furthermore, they can choose a new moral alignment, which determines what parts of \r\nthe world they can visit. Perhaps the most intriguing innovation is that the typical dungeon \r\ncrawler setup is reversed: rather than start at the top and work their way down, the party begins \r\nat the bottom of a volcano and must work its way back up.", 
      "Certain traditions carry across all three games, such as Boltac's Trading Post, the \r\nTemple of Cant, and odd monsters such as Creeping Coins. Connections such as these add \r\ncoherence to the series and are quite memorable for those who played the games.", 
      "Furthermore, all of the monsters and traps that existed to keep \r\nout wily adventurers now serve the opposite purpose -- to keep Werdna imprisoned. Getting \r\nWerdna out of the dungeon will take time and patience, but the revenge will no doubt be sweet. \r\nThankfully, Werdna is able to summon monsters to help him out, though the players are unable \r\nto control them directly.", 
      "To make matters worse, the ghost of one of Werdna's slain enemies, Trebor, \r\nhaunts the dungeon and will instantly kill Werdna if he stumbles upon him. Finally, every save of \r\nthe game resurrects all the monsters on the current level. Rumors of this game's difficulty have \r\nnot been exaggerated!", 
      "There's also a nice bit of history here that's not often discussed in \r\nmodern reviews of this game: Sir-Tech used some of the characters from disks it had received \r\nfrom gamers, who either wanted them repaired or sent them to show they had indeed solved the \r\ngame. The company used some of these purloined characters as do-gooder enemies for \r\nWerdna. The game also features three separate endings, the most difficult of which entitles \r\nplayers to the hallowed rank of Wizardry Grand Master.", 
      "The fourth game is perhaps the least known, since its graphics and audiovisuals \r\nwere hardly competitive for its release date, and its difficulty level ensured that no one but \r\nhardcore fans of the original games could complete it.", 
      "An effort is underway to translate this game into English. Otherwise, the only options are either \r\nto track down the old software and a system capable of running it (the NES version would \r\nprobably be the best choice for this purpose) or to illegally download the games from countless \r\nabandonware sites on the web.", 
      "It's recently been remade for \r\nWindows by Paul Pridham and Elias Pschernig. Jeff McCord is working with Pridham and \r\nPschernig to release an updated version of the game for Apple's iPhone.", 
      "McCord's computer science teacher, a Mr. Syler, was fond of admonishing \r\nhis class that there were to be \"no games in the computer room.\" Nonetheless, the acerbic \r\nteacher recognized McCord's gift and loaned him a key to the lab, which he used during off-\r\nhours to program and play-test the game.", 
      "Taking \r\ndamage or moving too quickly will cause the heart to pulse rapidly. If the heart beats too \r\nfuriously, the character will faint (and likely become monster meat). This fatigue system does \r\naway with the numerical hit point or vitality systems so prevalent in other games. Instead, \r\nplayers must listen to the beating heart, a sound well known for its unsettling effect in horror \r\nfilms.", 
      "This sound effect makes for a more visceral, arcade-like experience than most CRPGs, \r\nthen or now. The game was recently remade for Windows and is freely available for \r\ndownload.", 
      "Rather than generate a collection of must-have exclusives that would help sell the \r\nplatform, the policy disenfranchised developers and no doubt proved disastrous for Texas \r\nInstruments. The inevitable result is that the TI-99/4A had one of the smallest game libraries in \r\nthe industry; only 40 or so games were ever published for it, the bulk being remakes of popular \r\narcade games.", 
      "Another nice touch \r\nis the ability to target specific monsters with ranged weapons, rather than just firing them in a \r\nstraight line. Although there are only three classes available (fighter, wizard, and rogue), a \r\nspecial hero class was available to players who opted to lead a single adventurer in the \r\nrandomly-generated, ten-level maze. All in all, it's an intelligent system that was relatively easy \r\nto learn and quite flexible.", 
      "Although the game was one of the most successful for the TI-99/4A, Texas \r\nInstruments laid off Kenney shortly after its release. Kenney speculated in a 2002 interview that \r\nthe company was unhappy with his \"liberal political bent,\" but TI later contracted him to do some \r\nadditional databases for the game (they were never released).", 
      "Many of the games we've talked about so far have been assigned to one player, and the \r\nfew exceptions were online games. Arguably, most party-based CRPGs can be played with a \r\ngroup simply by assigning each player a character; the person behind the keyboard takes the \r\nplayers' orders and acts accordingly (in theory). Indeed, some early manuals hint at exactly this \r\nkind of gameplay. However, two early CRPGs written by Stuart Smith for Quality Software \r\nintegrated cooperative multiplayer options into the interface.", 
      "Again, the most innovative aspect of the game is the cooperative multiplayer options, though \r\ncritics made note of the 250 different types of creatures and intuitive gameplay. Critics did \r\ncomplain that the game didn't follow the Greek legends closely enough, and there are plenty of \r\nanachronisms, such as the use of iron and steel during what is ostensibly the Bronze Age (if not \r\nearlier). Apparently, even Doctor Who, the character from the famous British television show, \r\nmakes an appearance!", 
      "In the midst of the crisis, rumors surface of a Hyperspace \r\nBooster, which, if found, could reunite the Local Cluster with the Milky Way. However, players \r\nare given considerable leeway in achieving this goal. For instance, they might opt to become \r\nmerchant traders, shipping cargo back and forth among the 21 star systems of the Local \r\nCluster. Or they might take to mining, touching down on mineral-rich planets in a search for the \r\nmother lode. Finally, they might opt to become pirates themselves, earning rich rewards at the \r\nexpense of civilization.", 
      "Technically speaking, it might be a stretch to define this game as a CRPG, since \r\nthere is little in the way of character development. Although players must hire a crew, they are \r\nrepresented almost entirely by number and do not benefit from experience. However, players \r\ncan turn their earnings into upgrades for their ship, making it more efficient or effective in \r\ncombat.", 
      "During this history, we'll encounter several of these space simulator/CRPG hybrids that \r\nresist easy classification. Typically, they are characterized as open-ended games and usually \r\nfeature action-based combat in the style of a flight simulator, albeit with zero-G physics.", 
      "Unfortunately, the game seems to have \r\nbeen striving to be a jack of all trades; it incorporated a lengthy text adventure sequence with a \r\nvery limited parser. This segment was panned in reviews, and that, in addition to the again-hefty \r\nprice (this time $69.95, or $130.88 in 2006 dollars) may explain its almost total obscurity today.", 
      "Although there were certainly some ambitious and exemplary games produced between \r\n1980 and 1983, everyone knew the best was yet to come as computer hardware advanced and \r\nprogrammers continued to refine their skills. On the other hand, we can also say that, by 1983, \r\nalmost all of the conventions we'll see in later CRPGs had been established or at least \r\ndemonstrated.", 
      "While I certainly agree that these games were \r\ninnovative and even formative, I still view them more as prototypes: experimental CRPGs \r\ndesigned at a time when developers were still struggling to find their way. The genre simply \r\nneeded time to mature.", 
      "Although \r\nmany of the triumphs will be in the realm of graphics and sound, others have more to do with \r\nthe art of storytelling, world building, and character development. We'll also see developers \r\nstruggling to stay ahead of the latest advances in hardware, for we'll soon see how graphical \r\nconsiderations rise in prominence and, at least for some gamers, eventually trump all else."

      "Q: First off, I’m a bit confused about your work on earlier CRPGs. On your website, you state that you released a game called DND back in 1977, programming it in BASIC under the TOPS-10 operating system. Could you talk a bit more about your development of this game, such as what influenced you and what other CRPGs (or tabletop RPGs or wargames) influenced you? My research is rather sketchy on CRPGs available for mainframes during this era, so any information you can provide will be very helpful.", 
      "A: Well certainly I had played Dungeons and Dragons™ the paper game put out just previously by TSR. DND as a game evolved from a simple beginning showing where your character was and grew, adding creatures, specials, better displays in response to the suggestions of the players at the ENAD (engineering administration building) at Purdue where I was a freshmen. That summer I took it home and ported it to the Decsystem-10, which is the version that ended up getting handed around so much.", 
      "Q: There is also another program called dnd that was apparently written by Whisenhunt and Wood back in 1975 for PLATO. Is there a relationship between these games other than the names? I’m guessing that their “dnd” and your “DND” are two entirely different games. How does your game compare to theirs?", 
      "A: Not to my knowledge at the time. I did not know/see the other game, but note I was in the same area of the country as they were. Some of my play testers may have well been giving me suggestions from their experiences elsewhere.", 
      "Q: It’s been pointed out to me that Telengard features “procedurally generated” dungeons rather than “randomized” dungeons. I’m not sure I understand the difference. Can you please explain?", 
      "A: When I reproduced DND on the commodore Pet (8k RAM) I certainly had no room for the dungeon maps stored in the data files back on the main frame. Take your character’s X/Y/Z position, do some math involving prime numbers, pick out a few internal bits of the result and there you have a description of the current location!", 
      "Q: You say on your website that your Telengard game predates both Wizardry and the Temple of Apshai series. Are you certain of this? Also, what about Garriott’s Ultima and earlier Akalabeth games? The reason I’m asking is that mobygames and other sites list Akalabeth and the first Apshai game coming out in 1980, whereas to my understanding your game was released in 1982. Any clarification you can offer here would be immensely helpful. I’m also wondering if you played these other games, and what you thought of them.", 
      "A: DND was written in 1976. Telengard was written and played locally by myself and the local crowd in 1978 when the first Commodore PETs came out. I had ported it to the Atari 800, the Apple ][+ and the TRS-80 before it was noticed by Avalon Hill and licensed for marketing.", 
      "Q: One of the many interesting aspects of Telengard is it’s “real time” gameplay. What influenced your decision to make the game set in real-time, and why do you think it took so long for CRPGs to return to real-time?", 
      "A: In the terminal room where it was play tested, we had a limited amount of time on the machines at a session. Also the people player were quite competitive with each other. The real-time aspect was to get them moving and not hog the terminals.", 
      "It just got carried over to the microcomputer later.", 
      "Q: Telengard is often described as a “pure dungeon crawler,” without a story or quest to drive the action. Do you think that stories and characters just get in the way of a good CRPG? What do you think of story-heavy CRPGs?", 
      "A: In 8k of memory there was no room for a story. Today there should be a story in CRPGs, but unlike most of them out there now, it should not be a static story preprogrammed into the game, but a dynamic one created on the fly by the motives and personalities of the actors (NPCs) within the game setting.", 
      "Q: Can you describe the challenges you faced in making a CRPG for the early home computers? It must surely have been a challenge to go from mainframe programming to the Commodore PET.", 
      "A: Memory, Memory, Memory. I had to get the maximum play out of the smallest amount of code. It is one very dense hunk of BASIC programming.", 
      "Q: What was it like working for Avalon Hill back in the early 1980s? They were obviously a big publisher of wargames, but how did you fit in as a computer programmer of CRPGs?", 
      "Wow, excellent interview. I especially like his comments on modern gaming... too true! All this memory, and they're not using it properly.", 
      "I had read on a page at some point that someone may be working on a PC re-make of Telengard. Any truth to the rumor? I would hope that anyone pursuing such a project would ask Mr. Lawrence prior to starting.", 
      "Hm, I think I have his name spelled wrong on my website... the place I got it from had it as \"Laurence\"... I'll be sure to update that.", 
      "http://buildingworlds.com/telengard/",

      "ENJOY, everyone!  I know Dan would want you all to enjoy it..", 
      "If I find other source code, I'll try to come back and post here again.", 
      "Regards,", 
      "Chris..", 
      "That's terrible news about Daniel Lawrence. Thanks for the update!", 
      "Dan's servers will still be available, he left them to a trusted friend and he will be moving them soon. Dan was a great friend and I will miss him greatly.", 
      "Ray", 
      "Actually, I have one of the source versions of DND from my college days (being a software pack-rat), and recently finished a complete reimplementation in Java.  And, yes, I did discuss it with Dan shortly before his passing (I also sent him the old source, since he didn't have a copy).  He was quite happy for me to do my project and wished me well.  I'm quite sad that Dan didn't live to see it, and to kibitz on its evolution.", 
      "To the anonymouse develper,", 
      "I hope you have had good luck with your development.  If you can, please give us an update.  I don't totally understand why I have a copy of Call of Duty, but I still play DND.  I never played the live dice-based game, but I got started in the late 70's on a DEC PDP and it must just take me back to simpler times.   In any case, I appreciate the fact that others still love this game, too.   I thought I was a little crazy, which may be the case no matter what.  But, it's great to find out that others still appreciate what was once a software revolution for computer lovers in the formative years of I.T.", 
      "Since there was a new comment here, that reminded me that I was recently able to procure a boxed copy of a previously little known (or even mostly unknown since its release) Heathkit CP/M version of Telengard for the Heathkit/Zenith line of computers. A few copies popped up from a Venezuelan warehouse and were put up for sale on eBay. One copy found its way into my hands and another Heathkit collector I know from a mailing list. I don't know where the other two copies went to.", 
      "Anyway, Avalon Hill had a surprising amount of support for Heathkit CP/M (I own three different boxed AH games for the platform), though Telengard was perhaps the biggest surprise because I know of no other sources that were aware of its existence, which is quite odd for a game that's been so heavily documented and gotten the fansite treatment and what-not.",

      "There are a couple of mysteries in the game that would probably be cleared up with the manual, but I haven’t been able to find anyone with a copy, and I haven’t been able to track down creator Thomas Hanlin. The first mystery is called a “freen.” When you start a character, the game asks if you want one, and if you say yes, the character profile says that you’re “wearing” it. During combat, it absorbs damage from poison. This makes it sound like it’s some kind of magic item, but you can also be attacked by freens and “call” them with a spell, which causes you to lose hit points permanently. I don’t know how to reconcile a freen as a creature and something you wear.", 
      "The second mystery concerns a command: “(A)activate mad Uncle Sisten’s device.” The command fails most of the time but occasionally randomly teleports the player. The back story probably tells more about who Uncle Sisten is.", 
      "An area in the upper-right corner seemed closed off, so I used my “Melt Through Wall” spell to enter. The game informed me that I had found the “Kinoben Cat,” an item that appeared permanently in my inventory from thereon. Clearly, this was supposed to be some kind of main quest.", 
      "After I got the Cat, I noted that “Glyph of Recall” no longer worked, so I began to slowly make my way up the five levels to the surface. With such large levels, it took forever–especially since trap doors kept knocking me down again. I started using “Melt Through Wall” to systematically explore each level, recharging in place when necessary (my fighting skill and level meant I didn’t have to waste spell points in combat). Eventually, I made my way to the surface and got a winning screen!"

SporkHack oder UnNetHack. Auch ein zweites NetHack-Turnier namens Junethack (jeweils im Sommer), das die Forks mit einbindet und etwas freundlicher ist für Spieler, die nicht jeden Tag ascenden können. Die meisten Leute hängen im IRC in #nethack auf Freenode rum. Dort werden auch die Tode der Spieler und andere Ereignisse vom Public Server in Echtzeit gemeldet, man kriegt also einiges mit, was gerade auf dem Server läuft ohne direkt draufschauen zu müssen.",

I think it is more a psychological affair: as long as the playerbase expects the devteam to ship another release, they still \"have it\". Whereas once the playerbase accepts a fork, the vaniall devteam lost it. Such a transition is never easy unless the maintainers cooperate (which did happen for Crawl, for example). Still, the transition Hack -> Nethack was exactly a hostile takeover, and it only needed two years, not ten. :(", 
      "dpeg, you mentioned in the podcast that you wanted an option to suppress the intro text that nobody reads. I'm not sure at what point in time in NetHack's history that was, but NetHack 3.4.3 has the \"legacy\" option which does exactly that.", 
      "tung: Yes, of course! My point was more that \"story-telling\" in roguelikes should not be done using paragraphs of text -- if well done, the story should be emergent! Nethack's starting screen says something which is completely unrelated to all gameplay, and the Quest wall of text unfortunately is even opposite to the gameplay experience. I am really unhappy about the latter because following the text would open up very cool gameplay possibilities!",

But it applies to UI too - the core players get over the UI learning curve and just enjoy the game. When other criticise the difficult UI they get very defensive, because for them there is no longer a difficult UI to learn. We thus end up with a big imbalance of opinions on such issues.", 
      "as far as mobile version UI goes, nethack is one of my favorites, at least in android. As opposed to both dcss and angband variants (mostly for playing sil) the virtual keyboards used are really annoying and you end up with impossible viewports in phones (dunno about tablets). If I feel playing a couple of turns I am more likely to fire up nethack than any other roguelike (except for pixel dungeon which is THE best roguelike for mobile for me, thats for another topic tho')",

Despite (or perhaps because of) the primitive graphics, this constant refinement over decades has resulted in gameplay of great depth and variety.", 
      "While the game ostensibly rotates around the staples of character statistics, combat, inventory, and spells, the player will find that strung along the randomly-generated dungeons are key places and creatures that present an emergent narrative without requiring wordy exposition, gently directing or distracting the player from the overarching quest to retrieve the hoary old Amulet of Yendor.", 
      "Death, or indeed any action in the game, is final. The player cannot revert to a previous save point. The game is saved on exit and deleted when reloaded. Otherwise, saved games are inaccessible to the player. Every action the player takes is therefore irrevocable. Since a single game may easily last days or weeks, it is rarely worth starting over, no matter what setback in encountered, and so the player must learn to live with his failures as well as his successes, and tremendous emotion may be invested in the precious avatar.", 
      "While there is no plot, per se, the character is tasked with delving into the dungeon, retrieving the Amulet of Yendor, bringing it to a god's altar in heaven, and sacrificing it; after players do that, they \"ascend\" (essentially, winning). Doing this is much easier said than done, especially without the use of spoilers (which are generally frowned upon in the hardcore community).",

The entire appeal of roguelikes, as I see it (and that includes pseudo-roguelikes which have random worlds and permadeath but aren't turn based) is that you have to actually optimize, actually get better in order to progress: learn which things are good, which ones are situational, which ones are mostly bad. And it's not enough to get the good things, you have to get a picture of the risk/reward ratios too, so that you take less risk when you're on a path to winning, and more when you aren't.

Nethack has very few meaningful strategic decisions. Crawl/DCSS had the right idea when they aggressively stripped \"no-brainer\" and counterintuitive decisions from the game.", 
      "but at the heart nethack is a memorization and risk minimization game.", 
      "Well, there is one game that has a lot of that:", 
      "It is graphical enough to support your game play, but still has some of the feel of a character based game like Nethack, and perhaps an even more elaborate system of magic, faith and skills - plus an enormous set of maps.", 
      "Pity it hasn't been updated meaningfully for over a decade - perhaps it just hit perfection?", 
      "Though I've ascended a few characters, I haven't tried to do so in a while, mainly because of that long, slow slog through the mazes. I'd consider changing things around so that there's maybe a 1/10 chance of getting a maze on any standard Gehennom level - or better yet, only the special levels get mazes.", 
      "Pity it hasn't been updated meaningfully for over a decade - perhaps it just hit perfection?", 
      "This pattern isn't unique to Nethack, for better or worse, it's endemic to most Fantasy RPGs, in my experience.  I think it's a game-balance issue - either the wizard is the specialist at *magic* which is a powerful force, or *magic* is simply a skill tree where other classes have their own powerful skills (i.e., Diablo).", 
      "Funny how the wizard is one of the weakest characters at the beginning of the game, but becomes almost unstoppable at experience level 30.", 
      "No, I dont mean graphics wise, or anything like that.", 
      "Nethack needs full multi-user, and an overhaul on the generated story (what there is of it), so that the core process can be daemonized, and users attaching to the system can play against each other.", 
      "The plot of NetHack is to get the silly amulet and take it to YOUR god's altar on the last level, before anyone else can. Given the obscene amount times people die, it could reasonably take weeks for this to happen. (Seriously-- Gehenna without any genocide scrolls? LOL! As IF!)", 
      "I would like to see a fully MUD revamp version of NetHack, that connects users either through port listener, with a remote client app.  The \"remote client\" can be run locally on the system using ssh, or it can attach to an exported listen port.  Either way, players attach to the server deamon, which does the real nitty gritty.", 
      "The spontaneous level creation is a fun part of Nethack, and I would like to keep that-- just have the game world get reset with new random dungeons after somebody manages to put the amulet of yendor on an altar at the end.", 
      "Why would this be more awesome than nethack already is?", 
      "1) Players can choose weather or not to cooperate to get through certain areas before having to go all \"highlander\" on each other at the end.", 
      "2) Nethack's dungeons were deformable at-will using certain spells/items. Even without regenerating the world each and every time, the gameworld would change in unpredictable ways with multiple human players attacking it and changing it.", 
      "Nethack uses so little resources on modern systems that it is not even funny at all. Seriously, I can run it on an openwrt enabled router over ssh. For real. A daemonized instance of it would hardly make anything modern even twitch, even with many users stuck on it.", 
      "There were actually Rogue-like MUD games, ascii graphics and all.  MAngband, Rogue Mud, etc.", 
      "I know, but not nethack.", 
      "These days, too many multi-player games focus on \"events\", and have various things nerfed for casual players.", 
      "Nethack is not for casual gamers. It chews them up and spits them out again until they become system exploiting, backstabbing bastards. That's the only real way to win that game.", 
      "As such, any vandalism, griefing, or other \"It makes my mangina hurt!\" type things that would happen in a fully daemonized version of nethack would ONLY server to ENHANCE the game.", 
      "Not sure how saving and loading would work. Whoever has the amulet of yendor would be virtually untouchable while in the nether of being offline, and having multiple true amulets of yendor would be game breaking. This means somebody could actually be a real dick and obtain the real amulet, save, then quit playing, forcing the server admin to reset the game to make it completable again.", 
      "Perhaps making players vulnerable while offline? (say, \"asleep\"?) Making hidden passages to crawl into for protection when you have to stop playing would solve that issue, and add incentive to get back asap before somebody finds you and gives you a finger of death.", 
      "The stupid wizard that shows up when you get the amulet would need to be prevented from teleporting to a sleeping player and stealing the amulet though.", 
      "A more serious issue with multi-player would be handling the \"turn based\" nature of the game...how do you decide when the game \"ticks\"?  And if it's not turn based, then it's really not neckhack any more...", 
      "-- Pete.", 
      "You could go to a semi-realtime version if there aren't too many players, where you can issue any string of commands (including multi-turn commands like walk-to)  and they execute sequentially until any player doesn't have an action queued up, some \"demands a player's attention\" event has occurred, or a player decides to interrupt their commands. You could give other players the option to force the current turn to end if any player hasn't taken an action and a minimum amount of time has passed.", 
      "Make it robotic. Don't have people control their character directly, but instead submit an AI routine to make the decisions. Then simply impose a time limit on the AI, and make the command \"wait\" if it's exceeded.", 
      "if you had to wait for others to finish their turn or if the turns had a time limit, it would take much longer than couple of weeks for anyone to finish.", 
      "this is what many people forget. the interface as it is, is suited for a single player game. like instead of pressing a button and typing in a number to wait for 100 turns would you rather wait half an hour? all the game mechanics would need changing.      thing is, nethack is TURN BASED. changing it to a realtime game doesn't quite work out simply and in the end it is something totally else.", 
      "and in a little while all the levels would be digged up. of course, you could make them bigger than the screen but that would be totally changing the game mechanic again.", 
      "gehenna isn't too bad. usually you would have strong enough character to take the normal enemies there anyways.", 
      "I've actually been writing a multiplayer roguelike so I may take a stab at some of these.", 
      "I don't think there's any way to have a turn-based multiplayer dungeon game with a significant amount of people in it. At some point someone lags and the game dies. If you decide to have a cut off point (like 5 seconds per turn) then it just becomes a really slow real-time game. People hate it and stopped playing almost immediately during play testing.", 
      "Pretty much on the money here, I've had to re-evaluate almost every mechanic, especially the sleep/paralysis ones. The good news is that if you play in a team you are suddenly a lot more resilient to these effects, your team becomes your shield.", 
      "I agree that it would be near impossible to port all the NetHack mechanics verbatim. You could probably make something for a small team of four people or so, who are friends and talking on teamspeak or something, but not a game with hundreds or thousands of players.", 
      "I did playtesting with destructable dungeons, it's a nightmare. You just can't let people dig holes in the floors, walls. Perhaps the only way it would work is if it literally took hours to dig one square. I experimented with allowing you to dig a path with a pick, and letting the dungeon heal itself over time, it works OK but doesn't really add much to the game.", 
      "if you had to wait for others to finish their turn or if the turns had a time limit, it would take much longer than couple of weeks for anyone to finish.", 
      "this is what many people forget. the interface as it is, is suited for a single player game. like instead of pressing a button and typing in a number to wait for 100 turns would you rather wait half an hour? all the game mechanics would need changing.",

      "NAO and other public servers start an individual process for each player, there is no NetHack server process in the usual sense.", 
      "Seriously-- Gehenna without any genocide scrolls? LOL! As IF!", 
      "It all depends on how long you've been playing. (And how long you've been reading spoilers) For those who play for conducts, the most common conducts are:", 
      "Never changed shape.", 
      "Never polymorphed an item.", 
      "Never wished for an artifact item.", 
      "Never wished for a regular item.", 
      "Genocideless.", 
      "So you see lots of five-conduct ascensions, since these five are relatively easy to achieve. Easier than say, weaponless. Or pacifist.", 
      "If it wasn't for this game, I for one would have fininished my PhD a year earlier. Will nobody think of the students?", 
      "No, you need to learn to take notes on your failures, focus more and try again.", 
      "If you are going to cheat, why bother playing? just tell people you play, it's the same thing but with less effort.", 
      "I refuse to believe that I am alone in remembering the awesomeness that was Omega.", 
      "I have not played recent forks or versions of nethack, but I recall the original starting out in a dungeon and forever progressing through the same dungeon randomly and endlessly. Where Omega had the same random dungeons, it expanded to include a country-side, a city, many villages, a volcano, a sewer, many temples, and much more.  So much more depth, yet the same rogue-like text graphics.", 
      "Oh Omega, how I miss thee.", 
      "I too greatly enjoyed playing Omega - much more so than Nethack.", 
      "I can't imagine anyone using the vi shortcuts (k for up and, going clockwise, u l n j b h and y).", 
      "One hand on numpad, the other over the main keys.", 
      "vi?  vi?  Do you snap your suspenders and tug your beard as you pine for the days of pine over a 300 baud line?  Real men/women/furry creatures from Alpha centauri, use VIM.  And they use the cursor keys...because they have a keyboard with actual cursor keys instead of a ADM3A terminal.   You'd think that terminal makers never used a Selectric.", 
      "Imagine harder then, I don't know anyone who'd play it on the numpad, sounds rather inconvenient because all the other keys are on the main alphanumeric block.", 
      "In fact, I originally started to play nethack in order to get comfortable with hjkl for later use in vi.", 
      "Real men/women use what's there.", 
      "Trying to be funny -- you're doing it wrong.", 
      "vi?  vi? Do you snap your suspenders and tug your beard as you pine for the days of pine over a 300 baud line?",

      "The higher frame rate gives you the edge that you'll need on the astral plane.    And don't even think about trying it without a fully tweaked, N-key rollover mechanical keyboard!   Those E's on the plane of air aren't gonna sit around sipping Earl Gray Tea waiting for your laggy $5 bargain bin membrane 'board!", 
      "You haven't seen NetHack until you've seen it on a retina MacBook or iMac.  I nearly soiled my trousers the first time I saw \"L\" coming at me on such a display.", 
      "I've noted that the Steam game, \"Dungeons of Dredmor\", is a nice upgrade to the genre of rogue-like games. It's good, for those who enjoy them and like a bit more graphics. It has different shop mechanics, but I was given a copy and enjoyed it. And I do remember compiling and playing the original Rogue decades ago, along with 'rogomatic' to watch someone _else_ trying to dungeon dive.", 
      "Most game makers are recycling the same crap over and over again. Go on a quest, kill the monsters, create an army, manage resources etc. That's about it.", 
      "Boring......", 
      "And Shakespeare did all the plots, therefore nothing good has been written since.", 
      "That is what you sound like.", 
      "Yeah, you see one romantic comedy you've seen them all. Some are funny but they do not hold my interest. As is the boy meets girl tragedy which also has been rehashed countless times. He did have a a way of writing about the upper classes so anything about the under classes would not be in is lexicon.  But there is a huge amount of recycling in movies and literature finding something fresh is hard for me to find. \"Rambo\" and imitators are just rehashes of Hercules perhaps. Though \"Son of Rambo\" was fun.", 
      "I've played it on and off, for years. Have never won, not once, even in X (explore) mode.",

      "Tell us a bit about yourself.", 
      "My name is Robin Bandy, I'm 37 years old and married; my wife has played NetHack, but is not exactly excited about how much of my time the Tournament takes each year though she's been extremely patient about it.  I grew up on a ranch in southwest Colorado, but I've lived in the hills in east Oakland, California, since '97.", 
      "Though my college degrees are in anthropology and history, I've been a professional geek since '94 and have been freelance since '97; most of my work these days is as a consultant running the server farm that runs 1up.com, gamevideos.com and mycheats.com for Ziff Davis Media.", 
      "My other main interest after my wife and my geekery is making hard apple cider (and a variety of other fruit wines as well as a small amount of beer); we're fortunate to live in a part of Oakland that was an orchard 100 years ago, so most of our neighborhood has semi-wild apple trees which are great for ciders.  Cider bottling time is usually about halfway through the Tournament, which tends to liven things up a bit.  ;-)", 
      "His brother, who runs another tournament server and has been involved with the running since the beginning, adds:", 
      "My name is Matt Bandy. I am Robin's older brother. I have a PhD in Anthropology from UC Berkeley and am an archaeologist who works in Peru, Bolivia, and the United States. I live in Boulder, Colorado. I had the idea for the tournament many years ago and co-wrote the code (with Robin) for the first few years. Robin has since taken the over maintanance and development of the tournament and it really is his baby and it has been for at least five years now.", 
      "How did the tournament get started?", 
      "That was actually my brother Matt's idea; as I remember it, it was basically a case of him saying \"Hey, you know what would be fun to do?\" and it just kinda snowballing from there.", 
      "He and I co-wrote the first version of the control server, and he wrote most of the original game server kit on his own; we still use most of his game server code, but we lost the original control server several years ago when that server lost its primary and backup disks in the same night so I had to re-write all of it from scratch.  He runs a game server each year now, but with two kids that's about all he has the time to contribute.", 
      "When did the tournament first become really popular?  Was it around the time Slashdot first linked to it?", 
      "The first time Slashdot posted a front-page link (in 2001) almost doubled the number of players, it's true, but the biggest year was actually the year after that.  We don't have anything except the scoreboard files from the years before 2002, but I think we had ~400 competitors in 2000 and 800 in 2001; in 2002 we had 1071 players and haven't had a year that big since.", 
      "The time we consider the Tournament to have really become a staple in the NetHack community was with the release of 3.4.3 when the release notes file opened with the sentence \"Now that the November tournament period is over, it is time for the NetHack DevTeam to make NetHack 3.4.3 available.\"; according to VersionTracker that was on 2004-01-08.", 
      "This year, actually, we're hoping to be the largest; I'm even trying to write a press release.  ;-)", 
      "How well does the distributed game hosting software work?  Were there any interesting technical challenges in getting the servers up and synced?", 
      "It actually does a pretty good job, though the rsync commands could stand a bit of debugging; the cron jobs throw errors when the source directories are empty for example.", 
      "The niftiest thing in it, in my opinion, was the way Matt set it up to work via ssh remote command execution so that the one control server can execute scripts on the game servers to get information from them; combined with a clever bit of Perl that lets us use flavor-specific Perl libraries for various commands means that the same script can be called on the various game servers and work the same way even though they're running many flavors of Unix.", 
      "I've gone on to use that style of remote command many times since; it's a staple for the entire admin structure on the servers that I built and run for 1up.com, for example.", 
      "The trophy system came about as a fairer way to judge playing skill than the old score-based system, which is vulnerable to certain score-optimal playing styles that aren't generally considered normal play.  Would you like to discuss the thinking behind the current trophy setup?", 
      "The major trophies, other than First Ascension, are all intended to recognize different play styles that have developed in the community over the years; the Recognition trophies are also aimed at that, but we extended them down to include folks who (like myself) cannot reliably ascend.", 
      "OK, another one of them is also not really based on a play style but rather on an aspect of the game: it kills a lot of characters, so the Most Unique Deaths trophy came in as a joke originally; now, though, it has actually developed into a play style that (as you mention below) abandons the concept of \"winning\" completely.", 
      "The Clan trophy is a bit of a joke, as the whole clan system is (Hi EIT!).  It would be a lot more meaningful except for the fact that RGRN overshadows everyone else by such a huge margin.  This is definitely an area that could use some serious re-imagining.", 
      "One of the most interesting trophies, although one that a player has to almost abandon going for wins to shoot for, is Most Unique Deaths.  For 2007's Most Deaths trophy, player theta achieved 74% of all the deaths categorized in the game, for a little more (according to my math) than 80 death types.  Another neat trophy is the \"Death by Trickery\" consolation prize.  Are there any other clever new trophy types (or any new trophies at all) coming this year?", 
      "Trickery is actually the game's internal name for what happens to you when something goes wrong with the game files that makes the game give up completely; this is usually caused by an admin screwing something up, so we adopted it as the apology for when something we do kills off a character.", 
      "We do have one more major trophy in mind and I've actually done the artwork for its icon, though it won't premier this year; it will be named something prosaic like \"Most Extinctions\", but I think of the icon image as being \"ASCII Chief\" since it's based on the iconic helmet from Halo.", 
      "(Note: this will probably be a trophy for the most complete \"extinctionist\" game.  Nethack keeps a count of the number of monsters of each species that are generated, and when the count hits 120 most of them will no longer be randomly generated except in special circumstances.  Extinctionist players seek to do this to all monster types that respect extinction, which tends to make for very long games.)", 
      "For several years now marvin, a.k.a. Christian Bressler, has won the grand prize, Best of 13.  Last year sawtooth game him a bit of a run for his money, tying for most ascensions overall at 14.  Now that multiple players are getting to the point where they are competitive for the grand prize, is it possible that you'll have to come up with some other way of measuring playing skill?", 
      "Yep; we're really pleased to see more players rising up to those levels.  The closest anyone but marvin has gotten to the Best of 13 is sawtooth's 11 from two years ago, so there's probably some life in that stunt yet.", 
      "We don't have any ideas in mind for what would replace it, but we've gotten several suggestions.  If (or when) we do bring in a new grand prize we'll keep the Best of 13 active, probably by downgrading it to being a major trophy.", 
      "Would you mind telling us a bit (officially) about the Challenge system and player reactions to past challenges?  How do players \"opt out\" of a challenge?  Are there and difficulties with the challenge patches accidentally changing the logic of the vanilla game, even if the player opts out?   Would you like to drop any hints about this year's challenge?", 
      "The Challenge trophies I added in 2005 when I had to write a new control server from scratch; they (like the Recognition trophies) were intended to open the scoreboard up to some new folks who (like myself) wouldn't be able to compete at the levels the old scoreboard required.  By adding this additional dimension to the Tournament, and by making it one that the serious ascenders would probably avoid, it gives a lot more people a chance to get onto the scoreboard and a lot of new ways to play.", 
      "This year's Challenge really expands on that, to the point that it has its own separate scoreboard in addition to the list of players who've completed it that past Challenges have had.", 
      "They were also intended to be a bit of an apology to the players, since the old system was wiped out about a month before the Tournament was due to start and I wasn't at all certain that I'd be able to get the new system built up enough to start on time.", 
      "The Grue and PacMan Challenges have been the most complicated, since they both involved creating new levels and changing how light/dark worked for the Grues and overriding the vision system completely for the PacMan level.  In both cases many characters (some of whom weren't on the Challenge) died in the first few days from bugs in my Challenge code and players have been rightly annoyed about that.", 
      "The basic idea of each Challenge is a narrative, hung onto a single feature of NetHack, which will be unavailable until the player completes the Challenge; last year's PacMan Challenge is a good example: when a player tries to eat a fruit, they'll be offered a Challenge (with nothing to say what it is; the Challenge must be entered into blindly) and the choice of accepting the Challenge, declining it or ignoring it for the rest of the Tournament.", 
      "Players who ignore it will not be offered it again in that year, players who decline it will not be offered it again in that game, players who accept it are given a little story about \"the necromancers Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde (the four greatest villains of their age)\" since I'm very fond of stupid jokes and I also like to make sure there are enough clues around for players to figure out what the Challenge is going to be.", 
      "Once the player has accepted, they will be prevented from eating any fruit in the Game until they either complete the Challenge (by playing a NetHack-ified PacMan game) or log onto the web site to block it from there.", 
      "Hints?  OK, two words: \"Bizarro Orgasmatron\" ... ;-)", 
      "Any plans to expand the tournament to cover notable variants, like SLASH'EM, SporkHack or Nethack Brass?  How about other popular roguelike games like Angband or Crawl?", 
      "I would definitely be up for that, but I'd really need to do it by working with someone from each game's community who could be responsible for that game's presence; in addition to having to patch NetHack to get it to log the data we need for the trophies, I really think an important part of the Tournament's acceptance has been that we try to build it in NetHack's style as well as we can and I don't really have the experience with any of the other major roguelikes to do that for them.", 
      "How about leaving a devnull Nethack server up year 'round?", 
      "It's said on the web site for many years that we would do that, and we really should either do it or delete that line.  ;-)", 
      "At this point, though, I'm leaning towards not.  Unless NAO is short on capacity, they do an excellent job of providing a public playground and I really can't take the time to either adapt our system to running a regular server or learning how their system works.", 
      "If they do need additional capacity, or if they disappear for some reason and no one else can step in, we would certainly dedicate at least one server to being a full-time NetHack service but as long as we're not needed for that we'll keep our resources focused on the Tournament.", 
      "I am, however, working on another roguelike project that will involve providing a server; I mentioned on rec.games.roguelike.development a few weeks ago that after 10 years of running this Tournament I've finally decided to try my hand at developing a new roguelike on my own and (though that won't be a /dev/null project) I will definitely have a public server up for it.", 
      "Would you want to say something more to @Play's audience?", 
      "It's not a game unless you can lose; in a great game, losing can be at least as much fun as winning.",

      "Nethack has been known for it’s difficulty, and has also been a prime example of the roguelike genre for quite literally decades. Originally released just under 26 years ago, the game has been updated a multitude of times up until 2003. It has also been ported to many different platforms – including DS, PSP, and Android. Ascending – or “winning” – Nethack is considered to be one of the hardest feats of gaming; as even individuals that may have played the game for years find it difficult to get far in the game. At times, the difficulty for individuals to get into Nethack has been compared to the difficulty for individuals to get into Dwarf Fortress.",

      "This is a story I wrote for Salon early on in my writing career (2000), when I was just beginning to shape my thoughts on gaming, Internet culture, and user-created content online.  Hope you enjoy this long weekend read - Hamlet", 
      "Does that suggest that Nethack is a technically superior computer game, despite its lack of graphic zap? Depends what you are looking for. Still beloved and played by many, Nethack embodies all that is obsessive, brilliant and geekishly lovable about hackerdom. And while open-source advocates are more likely to vaunt the movement's ability to transform desktop and network computing, this endearingly pokey dungeon adventure is perhaps its most accessible exemplar, demonstrating how its core virtues seem to work even in the unlikely realm of computer gaming:", 
      "With the all-text Nethack, the preferred graphics card is your mind's eye. This enables you to feel real terror, say, at the approach of an innocuous letter \"C\" hopping toward you across the screen -- since it represents the cockatrice, an occult-spawned dungeon fowl whose bite turns heroes to stone. With little predigested visual mediation between game play and your imagination, you'd often get the sense that you were, so to speak, playing against the game itself.", 
      "Many enhancements would seem, to an outsider, perfectionist beyond all necessity. Current DevTeam member Dean Luick thought, \"It was stupid that lamps extinguished when dropped from the hero's inventory ... The real reason [this happened] was that internally it was hard to have a lit area that wasn't centered on the hero. OK, change that.\" Luick corrected this barely perceptible shortcoming with an elegant subroutine, by which discarded, still-lit lanterns could keep track of themselves, as it were, throughout all the dungeon levels.", 
      "Eric Raymond first noticed the game sometime in the late '80s, attracted by his general love of fantasy role-playing games: \"I've been a fan for a long time, going back to the original 'Dungeons & Dragons' in 1973.\" In addition to the player's guide, Raymond brought some important contributions to the code and gameplay: \"Probably the most significant user-visible things I did were adding color support and blindfolds to the game.\" Nethack aficionados remember those blindfolds well -- wearing one gives you clairvoyant awareness of every monster on the current level, to great tactical advantage. (Only after first killing and eating a magic Floating Eye, of course.)", 
      "With the DevTeam coordinating these revisions transmitted from literally everywhere in the world, the game greatly expanded. And owing to the constant peer review native to open source, its architecture still grew increasingly stable. Of the thousands of times I've played it, despite its wild diversity of game play, I can recall maybe a mere handful when it crashed.", 
      "Among the DevTeam members interviewed, the question provokes some interest, but far more skepticism. While the rest of the world has made the Windows and Mac GUI-interface their home, many in the DevTeam steadfastly remain on the ASCII-only Unix terminals through which they first played the game. Janet Walz worries, \"Several of us don't work on platforms that are ever supported by fancy graphics libraries, so it would be difficult to continue the tradition of programming what we wanted to play.\" Collet, now a software engineer at Sun Microsystems, perhaps expresses the DevTeam's fundamental reservations best: \"We work on it because it is fun ... Take the fun out of working on it [by making it a job] and, most likely, the game won't be as much fun to the players either.\"", 
      "For all those who've loved Nethack -- many of whom find themselves now, to their own surprise, at the forefront of modern culture -- this must seem like a heartening suggestion. While most current commercial games can hide the papier mâché flimsiness of their construction behind flashy visuals, this also suggests we've reached a point where such graphics are good enough to actually enhance Nethack's ability to enthrall. Perhaps Slashdot will someday announce the formation of an ambitious new development team, eager to breathe visual life into this ancient dungeon that still teems with the genius of its many creators -- difficult to conquer, in play; in design, even now, near impossible to surpass."

      "The rogue-like elements come in the form of permadeath. Once you die, that’s it. Every 10 levels you fight a boss and move on to a new area of the dungeon with more challenging enemies and traps. Every 10 levels also serves as a form of checkpoint system, so you can start a new game further along, but this will make things more difficult because there has been less time to collect items and get health upgrades before moving on to these more challenging levels.", 
      "At the start of each playthough you’ll have a chance to pick a character, each with different starting weapons and stats. More characters can be unlocked by finding and saving them in rooms throughout the dungeon. Each character starts with a certain number of health points, some bombs used to get to otherwise unreachable areas, and a weapon that varies between characters. The Magician, for example, starts with a shotgun, while the Major starts with a machinegun. As you explore the levels you may find various new items in the form of weapons, orbs, and spells.", 
      "Item variety is pretty good. Weapons range from various rods that shoot magic bolts like fire or ice, to a cannon that fires projectiles that do heavy damage on a direct hit but also bounce and roll around momentarily. Orbs circle your character and have different effects. Some are obvious, like how the Fire Orb shoots fireballs whenever you shoot your gun. Others will need to be figured out, like how the Red Orb restores a health point to you if it kills an enemy. Spells occupy your third item slot and are very powerful items that can generally only be used every so often. Some outright kill all enemies on the screen. Others are more support-based, like restoring health or giving you extra time to explore the level before the ghosts appear. After they are used, spells must be recharged by killing enemies.", 
      "Occasionally you’ll find rooms that you can enter. There are casinos where you can spend money (Or even health, in some cases) to gamble with slot machines. Stores allow you to buy or upgrade items. Elevators allow you to go up or down levels. There is another type of room that provides some insight into the story, and occasionally these rooms will have a cage that can be destroyed to unlock a new character.", 
      "The core gameplay of 99 Levels to Hell is simple and pretty easy to get into, but also fun and challenging. The weapons, orbs, and spells can be very satisfying, and the way they interact can create interesting combos. Enemies tend to explode into chunks of gore when killed. Both the platforming and shooting are pretty solid, and the controls are good regardless of if you are using a keyboard and mouse or a controller.", 
      "On the other hand, this being a light rogue-like with randomly generated levels can lead to some frustrating moments outside of your control. For the most part the game is very challenging yet fair, but I have had some playthroughs where I just never found any good items. I have had a few times where I exited a room right into a monster, thus putting me in a situation where I took unavoidable damage. A handful of times the level generated in such a way that reaching the exit was actually impossible. After a while you’ll also discover that the levels aren’t quite as random as advertised. It seems like the developers created a bunch of templates that rearrange levels in random ways, so eventually you’ll start to see some pretty similar layouts.", 
      "The aesthetic is a bit mismatched too. I actually like the cartoony art direction, even though the animations aren’t as smooth as they could have been, but the music and narration is darker and creepier than the actual visuals would suggest it should be. I’m still on the fence in regards to how well the two blend together.", 
      "There are some performance issues here and there, too. The game’s initial load time is pretty long, to the point that I thought something went horribly wrong the first time I booted the game up. A few times I encountered bizarre drops below 30 FPS that could only be fixed by restarting my PC. The frame rate problems were very few and far between though; I’ve put about 10 hours into this game so far and it only happened twice.",

      "Above: Players will have to survive through 99 levels of torture to reach the big boss, the Devil himself.", 
      "Imagine the popular indie platformer Spelunky, only bloodier. Or Bubble Bobble with guns.", 
      "Daugaard is still worried people will see it as a clone or knock-off, he said to GamesBeat, since Spelunky released earlier in 2009. “Actually, I didn’t know about Spelunky when I started making 99 Levels To Hell back in 2011,” he said. “Originally, I set out to do a roguelike mix of Metal Slug and Bubble Bobble, and I think I kinda came pretty close.”", 
      "The Metal Slug influence is obvious — players run and gun. That’s one main difference from Spelunky: You always have an aiming reticule. “I chose to leave it in, even when you use the controller, to better let you know where you are shooting,” said Daugaard. “The character gets a bit small on the screen sometimes, so it helps your aim a lot.”", 
      "That doesn’t mean 99 Levels to Hell is necessarily any easier than Spelunky (which Daugaard called a “masterpiece”): I did pathetically bad in my time with it — worse than Daugaard said I should have done.", 
      "“99 Levels To Hell is more about action, getting a lot of kills, upgrading the gun the game gives you, and finding out how to use it. I wanted to create something with more kills and more action — without it being too difficult. You should be able to get to the first boss fight within the first few tries.”", 
      "Daugaard does cut players a break in case they struggle. Every time you beat a boss, you unlock a dungeon door that acts as a shortcut.", 
      "“There seem to be a trend in games that punish players a lot — Super Meat Boy, Spelunky, Dark Souls, and so forth,” he said. “So it seemed like the right time to make a game like that. I always loved that way of gaming. You get a real kick out of completing a level when the game is really hard.”", 
      "The challenge in 99 Levels is to obtain the right combination of upgrades, orbs, and weapons, which can make you unbeatable. But the longer you spend searching for them, the greater the chance angry ghosts will arrive and hunt you down. (Yep — it has ghosts, just like in Spelunky.)", 
      "“So it’s all about knowing if you have enough time to search and then get out quickly,” he said.", 
      "Bubble Bobble, on the other hand, doesn’t make me think of punishing games like those that Daugaard mentioned. But the classic arcade game shares a lot in common with Daugaard’s title, including the 100-level design.", 
      "“It’s fast-paced at times, but it has a surprising level of tactics as well,” he said of Bubble Bobble. “Knowing how the monsters react and move, figuring out what the different items do, is key to beating a level.", 
      "“I think 99 has a lot of the same qualities. After playing the game for a while, you’ll start to recognize patterns in the levels and monsters. And at some point, you might know here to look for power-ups and when to use an umbrella or an elevator. Sometimes it’s a good idea to gamble on the elevator taking you back some levels — you might find just the power-up you needed.”", 
      "Some items may even make the game harder — although Daugaard confided that you can play as a dragon if you know where to find him (and you’re good enough).", 
      "But like Spelunky, you’re going to die — a lot.", 
      "“One of the biggest things that sets 99 Levels to Hell apart from Spelunky, aside from the gameplay, is the game’s story,” said Daugaard. “99 has a very detailed story told through poems that the player collects throughout the game. Once all pieces of the poem are collected, players will understand why our hero is fighting through the 99 levels to hell.”", 
      "Daugaard said players find these poems in secret rooms, where they also unlock new characters. These rooms — along with the shops, elevators, casinos, monsters, and power-ups — all spawn at random. And yes, I tried to kill the shop owner like in Spelunky. It didn’t work. But that’s a good thing. Daugaard isn’t copying Yu’s game here — the hunger for challenging, creative platformers is universal. This developer just loved the idea enough to stretch it out to 100 levels.", 
      "“For me, Spelunky started a new genre,” said Daugaard. “And I think there is room for more than a few games within that genre of action roguelikes.”",

      "In an unidentified future, a robot is sent into an abandoned office building to eat the remaining furniture. Only the security measures are still running. Turrets shooting lasers, drones seeking movement, and constantly shifting electrified walls still guard the defunct secret operations. The only evidence of what this company did are audio recordings on laptops, and they’re as random as the layout of the buildings.", 
      "Each new building offers new challenges. In Building 1, you only have to deal with the laser turrets. Building 2 adds drones and Building 3 adds sequenced panels that must be depressed in order to unlock the exit. It only gets more complex from there.", 
      "Causing more chaos is the leveling system. There are 21 experience levels, each unlocking a new gameplay element. Some are great. Your robot can vacuum up new power upgrades that let you throw down blocks to hide from drones, tunnel through cubicle walls for a quicker route to the exit, or turn invisible to pass through rooms unnoticed. Other elements are bad. The security measures are expanded or the default difficulty goes automatically higher regardless of your preferences in the game menu.", 
      "The action is also incredibly fast for the genre. Sure, you can find a nice cozy spot between a desk, a filing cabinet, and a monitor to hide in, but sooner or later you will have to make a mad dash across the office to absorb enough furniture to unlock the exit. It’s easy enough to eat everything in Building 1 when you just need to dodge some rotating lasers. Once the security measures are active and working against you, it’s a very different story.", 
      "Honestly, the biggest challenge of the game is the presentation. The robot controls are good—WASD to move, space to eat, shift to crouch, plus controller support—but the camera is a bit harder to deal with. You can rotate the room by moving the mouse, which gets the job done. It’s the angle of the camera itself that’s problematic. It’s low for a 3D stealth game."

      "Weapons and armor look like this:  |   [   )", 
      "Monsters look like this:  O  e  k", 
      "If your game uses the characters above, there had better be some pretty engaging gameplay to keep the player interested.  Welcome to the world of Roguelikes. Where games have evolved focusing on mechanics instead of graphics.", 
      "Rogue is a tactical turn based dungeon crawler with RPG elements.  You must guide your hero down the Dungeons of Doom to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor.  Each level is randomly generated and death is permanent. This gave Rogue an incredible amount of replayability.  You start each game without ever knowing what you will encounter,  or even if you would make it. This meant an almost infinite amount of gameplay and it all fit on a single floppy disk. Some players began making changes to the weapons, loot tables and probability formulas to create variations of the game.  Eventually these changes became entirely new games built from the Rogue code, they were referred to as Roguelikes.  Today there are still Roguelikes being made as well as games inspired by the genre. Let’s take a closer look at some of the elements of a Roguelike.", 
      "When you find loot in a Roguelike it may not always be something good.  One of the classic tropes is undefined items. In these games you will come across a potion and the only description you get is – a blue potion.  You have no idea what it does.  Well, why would you? Some guy just wandering through a dungeon shouldn’t automatically know everything about what’s down there.  You have three choices of what to do with the blue potion: drink it, drop it or hold it and hope to identify it later.  Drinking is the quickest, but most dangerous, option.  Some potions may restore health or temporarily increase your attack power, but not all are beneficial. If it poisons, paralyzes or permanently reduces your strength then you know not to drink any more.", 
      "Dropping it is safer in the short term, but at some point, you are going to find yourself in dire straights and wish you had some powerful potions to drink.  If you search a dungeon long enough you can find an item that can be used to tell you more about the potion, such as a Scroll of Identify.  Reading this scroll will give you information about any one item in your inventory.  After identifying your blue potion as a Potion of Healing, you automatically identify all blue potions as such.  However, this only lasts for the current game and resets when you start a new one.  The blue potion may be poison or worse next time.  You will find more unknown items than identifying ones, and your inventory space is limited.  You may also need to identify new weapons and armor.  It does you no good to upgrade from (+1)Leather Armor to Plate Armor if the new set is really (-5)(Cursed)Plate Armor.", 
      "Combat is considered turn based, although some could argue that it is more like an active pause system.  Whenever you perform an action so will all other creatures in the dungeon.  If you are in a room with an enemy they will not move until you do, presumably you are both moving at the same time.  Depending on the AI, they may either move toward you, away from you or try to position themselves for a ranged attack.  After each step time stops in the game while you decide your next move.  Nothing happens unless you are active. Some games have added speed modifiers to movement.", 
      "In some cases, it is a character setting that you change from Walk to Run, in others it is an item or spell that can speed up your movement.  This works by assigning a unit of time to each action the player takes.  All monsters in the game base their movements off of this time.  As an example, we will assume a player speed of 1, with each action taking 1 unit of time.  If a monster has a speed of 0.5 then the player can move twice as fast. The monster will not move until the player performs two actions.  Obversely, if the monster has a speed of 2 then it gets two moves for each one made by the player. Of course there are advantages of moving slower, it maybe be stealthier or allow you to notice traps and hidden doors.  When you attack a monster they will attack back.  You do get the first strike, so if you can defeat the monster in one blow they will not get a chance to retaliate.  Some games allow you to dual wield weapons or carry lighter, faster weapons. In these cases, one attack may actually be comprised of two or more individual strikes before the monster can counter attack.", 
      "Many titles have taken advantage of color to create further variations, so a dragon maybe represented by a green D, but a blue D is a frost dragon.  This may still sound like a severe limitation, but when was the last time you played a game with more than a dozen unique enemies?  The usual cast includes feral dogs/wolves/coyotes, bandits/raiders/thugs and ogres/trolls/super mutants.  Mostly these are just reskined clones of each other.  Using simple letters let’s the Roguelike offer you a variety of enemies that differ in their strength, tactics and overall behavior while also being easily identified. Some of the lower resolution sprites used in games with graphics tiles can make it hard to identify what exactly you are fighting.  A Warlock and a Summoner may require two very different strategies, but if they look too much alike it could result in a dangerous misunderstanding.", 
      "The lack of graphics can potentially add much more to the player character customization.  New weapons and armor can be added or changed without having to remodel or retexture anything.  Giving the player extra abilities, such as dual wielding, shield throwing or a pro wrestling DDT is little more than adding them to some tables.  In most modern games, these would require new animations and a restructuring of the control scheme.  Most developers don’t like the idea of spending a lot of time and money creating unique features that most players will never see. This is also apparent when looking at games that let you choose a race for your character.", 
      "One concept that seems to be uniquely Roguelike is Perma-Death.  There are functions written into the games where exiting the game automatically saves, and loading a saved game also deletes it.  This means that when (not if) you die in a Roguelike you cannot reload or go back to your last checkpoint.  The only option is to create a new character and try again. For many who have never played these types of games, this seems to be a major negative of the genre. Video games have a long history where Game Over means insert another quarter, use one of your continues or reload last save.  For this reason, Roguelikes have developed a reputation of being punishingly difficult for the player.  However, to many fans of the genre this is one of the most important features.  You can’t get through a level by simple trial and error, you actually have to think very carefully about the actions you wish to take. Every decision made in the game becomes permanent, no do overs. Can your level 27 Dwarf Berserker take on a room of 5 Death Knights? Maybe, but do you really want to take that risk?", 
      "Anytime the player dies in a Roguelike it is because of a decision they made.  Many newer players will find themselves in a no-win scenario and proclaim that the game has unfairly punished them. Such as having their last torch burn out at a deep level of the dungeon and not being able find their way around, when they inadvertently stumble blindly into a nest of trolls. The more experienced player will plan ahead and take various precautions to avoid finding themselves in this situation, such as bringing spare torches or learning spells of light.  Within the genre, players have coined the term YASD which stands for Yet Another Stupid Death.  This refers to a time when the player goes against their better judgment and dies as a result.  These are the very obvious mistakes, and yet everyone makes them. Recently I was playing Angband and was making my way to the surface world.", 
      "On Level 2, I found a Wand of Identify which is worth a good deal of money, but my inventory was full.  I decided to drop my least expensive item and picked up the wand.  Food is cheap and I was so close to the surface I figured I wouldn’t need it anyway. Then I got stuck on Level 1.   I went round and round searching out secret doors and passages trying to find the stairs to the surface. Every staircase led back down and my character became hungry. Eventually the hunger became starvation and I lost a little bit of health with each step.  I used up all my potions of healing trying to find the staircase. I finally was able to get back to the town, then died of starvation about 20 steps from the inn where I could have purchased some food. Even though my mistake was made well before I died, this was very much a YASD.  This also illustrates two more common features of Roguelikes, limited inventory and eating.", 
      "In the early days of PC gaming, there were technical limits on how much information could be stored in the program, this limited the amount of items a player could carry.  Those limits still exist today, but they are so great that no game comes close to reaching them.  However, limited inventories is such a wide reaching and strategic game mechanic that you would be hard-pressed to find more than a handful of games which feature a truly unlimited inventory system. In Roguelikes you have a limited number of inventory slots.  Some items stack, so having 2 arrows takes up just as much space as 82 arrows. However once you fill your slots you must drop something to pick up any new items.  Some games have experimented with this system a bit, such as giving the player type specific inventory slots such as potion slots or weapon slots, or assigning a weight value to items that also limits how much you can carry.", 
      "There are some misconception about Roguelike that I would like to dispel.  They are not always high fantasy dungeon crawlers.  The settings for Roguelike games can be anything, sci-fi, survival horror, zombie apocalypse or even a trade show convention. Some don’t have dungeons at all and instead use large open world maps.  They are not old titles made for DOS, there are new games being released right now.  Just because things in the game are randomly generated does not mean that winning or losing is based on luck. You have no control over what the game gives you, but you have total control over what you do from there. While there are some fairly complex game mechanics in some, most of these games don’t have a prohibitively steep learning curve.", 
      "If you would like, here are some of my personal recommendations.  For those who have played either Doom or Doom II, I would highly suggest starting out with DoomRL.  The latest versions have real graphics instead of ASCII which means that every monster and item are instantly recognizable to Doom veterans.  Especially if you are new to Roguelikes, this will give you a familiar setting in which to learn the game mechanics.  Plus it is one of my favorite Roguelikes.  You may just want to jump right in and start playing a classic. A lot of Roguelike players would suggest Nethack, which is a great game.  There have even been several mods for it that update the graphics so new players can choose between the classic ASCII, a graphical tile set or a Diablo-esque 2.5D Isometric experience.  While Nethack is very popular, it’s not my favorite.", 
      "I prefer TOME.  Originally an acronym for Troubles Of Middle Earth, the game takes place in the world of JRR Tolkien.  It has a static overworld filled with familiar creatures, towns and characters, but the dungeons are all randomly generated.  The game has been around for many years and has several versions available, my personal favorite being version 2.3.5.  A few years ago the creators were given a Cease & Desist from the Lord of the Rings copywrite holders.  In response the game was completely rewritten and released as TOME 4,  Tales of Maj’Eyel.  The new version is made to appeal to both new and old Roguelike players alike. Some of the new features include detailed graphics and unlockable races and classes.  In a very bold, and somewhat controversial move, there is a difficulty setting which allows you to turn off permadeath.  I still prefer the older versions due to the higher complexity and deeper mechanics, but TOME 4 is a solid choice for just about anyone.", 
      "A CORRECTION FROM STEVEN SMITH:",

      "Thanks for the suggestion.  I added that to the list.", 
      "No mention of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead? For shame, it’s one of the best out there.", 
      "Absolutely agree! There are several zombie roguelikes out there, but whenever I say “zombie apocalypse roguelike” what I really mean is Cataclysm.", 
      "Roguelikes are great. I’m a big fan of Crawl, personally.", 
      "However, I have to take exception to the suggestion that the Roguelike is the evolution of mechanics rather than graphics. Roguelike games have been trying to perfect a specific experience for ~30 years, not develop new ones.", 
      "When I think back to the earlier Roguelikes they are much simpler in comparison to their modern counterparts. Many layers of newer, more intricate, game play mechanics have been added over the years. While the games all aim to present a very similar experience, I feel there has been a definite evolution. By contrast there are several genres where newer titles play very much the same as older ones. Playing multiplayer deathmatch in Doom or Duke Nukem 3D feels much like playing a modern Call of Duty. New shooters are more visually impressive, but aside from reloading or leaning out around a corner the mechanics are pretty much the same. At least this has been my observation, if you have a different perspective I’d be glad to hear it.", 
      "I see what you’re saying now. I wouldn’t say that no new layers have been added to other genres. I would count more realistic bullet physics/trajectories, cover systems and stealth aspects to be some of those mechanics that could really push the FPS genre on the whole. But it has always seemed to me, and it may just be the indie nature of the games, that Roguelikes take bigger and more frequent chances in adding new elements. I have seen some very interesting gameplay mechanics in Roguelikes that I would never expect to see in any other type of game", 
      "I’m definitely not a roguelike player. I just can’t deal with permadeath as I quickly lose interest in any game when faced with repeatedly having to start over.", 
      "I am with you.  It is not that I dislike a challenging game, but putting so much effort into beating a level/boss only to lose all progress is not appealing to me.", 
      "No mention of Brogue? One of the best of them, super polished and very well thought out. Also very pretty :3", 
      "It’s a take on combining the randomness, map generation and combat of a roguelike with dungeon crawler -type viewpoint and mechanics. Because we didn’t have a graphical artist, and we were bored to the over-use of pixel art in games, we decided to go to more on the parody & humor side.", 
      "Sword of the Stars: The Pit is also worth mentioning.", 
      "The Pit is a great game. I like how they switch between real time movement and turn based combat. The game also uses the cone of vision that I like so much from many other Roguelikes.", 
      "I like going back in time and remember those classics, but don’t have much time and/or interests in trying them all so I usually play the one or two I remember playing 30 years ago.", 
      "No A.D.O.M.? Really? It’s gotta be in the top 3 most popular roguelikes.", 
      "I love ADOM, easily one of my top 3 favorites of all time. It was definitely one I was thinking about and “consulting” while writing this. Specifically because it is one of those games that has both an over world and dungeons. However if I had started listing all the Roguelikes I wanted to talk about this article would have been 3 times longer.", 
      "Oh, my.", 
      "That would have been quite the editing adventure for me.", 
      "One factual error here–ToME never got a cease and desist order from the LoTR people.  It did from the Pern estate back when it was Pernangband, and Darkgod (the games creator) was concerned that it might happen at some point, but he removed the LoTR elements early in the ToME 4 development process before any such thing actually happened.", 
      "You Sir, are absolutely correct and I am thoroughly embarrassed. ToME 4 was originally to be Tales of Middle Earth:The 4th Age. In his blog DarkGod mentions that some large LoTR mods for other games had been served C&Ds and that he already went through that. So he was changing the name to Tales of Maj’Eyal. For the past 3 years I thought he was served the C&D for the Middle Earth stuff, but I just dug through the archives and he was talking about the C&D for Pern. Afraid of getting one for ToME because of the then newly announced movie The Hobbit, he took it upon himself to change the name."

      "Evolution in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon differs from other games in the Pokémon franchise.

Xatu can instantly tell that the player was formerly a human, and reveals that the natural disasters are directly related to the player's transformation. Unless order is restored to the world, it is possible that it could end. During this exchange, Team Meanies' leader, Gengar, is eavesdropping. Gengar then reveals this secret to the entire town, trying to rally the townspeople to eliminate the player.",

Even the player begins to believe Gengar's claims (due to the fact that he has been dreaming about Gardevoir, the Pokémon from the Ninetales legend). The partner continually tries to convince the player that these dreams are unrelated, but the player decides that he is unworthy to be on the Rescue Team. Alakazam of Team ACT visits the player later that night and tells him that it has been decided; the player is to be murdered, and he has one night to escape.",

With the world at peace, the player has to return as a human. However, as he leaves, all of the Pokémon realize how much of an impact that the player had on their lives (especially the partner, who bursts into tears). After the credits roll, the player truly wishes to return as a Pokémon. The story ends with a celebration of his return.",
