      "100 Rogues is an original Roguelike for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad devices.  It features two playable classes with unique skill trees (similar to Diablo), several tilesets, original SNES-style music, and fully animated pixel art.  100 Rogues was developed from scratch for the iPhone OS devices, and has a click to move control scheme rather than a virtual d-pad.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Gameplay\n",
      "A game of 100 Rogues is a linear progression through 12 dungeon levels spread across 3 worlds: The Bandit Hole, The Dungeon, and Hell. The first three levels of each world consist of randomly-generated maps initially populated by Mobs of different Monsters. After these Mobs are eliminated, levels are periodically repopulated with individual Monsters. The fourth and final level in each world is a pre-scripted fight with a Boss monster unique to that world. Travel through the worlds is 1-directional.\n",
      "\n",
      " Combat\n",
      "Combat is the core of gameplay, as mobs of monsters are the main obstacle to progression through the game. Ranged and Melee weapons exist, with different properties for accuracy, damage range, knockback capability, damage type (Magic, Physical, Godly, etc.). Random variations on these basic weapons exist, such as a Bow of Stopping, which can immobilize enemies when it lands a critical blow. Daggers and their variants also allow the player to make Backstab attacks, with greatly increased chances of landing critical hits when attacking from behind. Rare, specialized weapons also exist, with unusual and esoteric advantages, such as the Vim Tap dagger, which can sap energy from monsters that have special attacks (e.g. fireballs, summoning powers, vampiric attacks).\n",
      "Class Restrictions exist on cerain Weapon types. For example, only the Fairy Wizard is capable of using a Wand. Certain Skills are required to use other weapons, such as Axes, which require the Heavy Armaments skill available only to the Crusader (Dinoman Bruiser class is planned to have this skill inherently).\n",
      "Other weapons, namely the Gypsy's at-will fireball spell, require energy to use. Similarly, Bows require arrows to be able to attack. All items in the game can also be thrown as an improvised ranged attack. Some items are specifically designed to do so, and deal more damage as a result or can have apply unusual effects to the target area.\n",
      "The Monsters that are the target of attacks can attempt to fight back with similar abilities. Most monsters have a basic melee or ranged attack, with the same energy or ammo expenditure rules applying where appropriate, and often have similar rules for knockback, poison, etc.. Many monsters also possess an uncommon ability, such as Teleswap. Teleswap can be executed by Gypsies and Ghosts, and it causes the monster to trade places with the player, often placing him in the center of a Mob of Monsters for which he is less than prepared.\n",
      "Monsters have three basic behaviours: Melee, Ranged and Coward. Melee monsters will attempt to close distance if at all possible. Melee monsters even occasionally have Ranged attacks as well, but still prefer to close distance when movement is decided to be advantageous. Similarly, Ranged attacks attempt to stay 2-3 tiles away from the player, but some are still capable of melee attacks when pragmatic. Finally, Cowardly monsters will run from the player no matter what, with no ideal limit to the distance they keep from the player.\n",
      "Especially in Hell, these abilities grow particularly complicated and common, providing substantially more strategic considerations and forward-thinking from the player to navigate or avoid combat scenarios effectively. The Flour can heal other monsters or debuff the player, making him more vulnerable to physical attacks. Mini Satans leave a trail of fire behind them as they walk. Heads can shoot lasers through walls.\n",
      "\n",
      " Skills\n",
      "Combat strategy is at the heart of gameplay, and the key to success in battle is the result of intelligent choice and application of skills. Skills are purchased using Skill Points, which are acquired at the first level and at even levels after that. Each player class has 8-10 Skills available for purchase, which can be broken down into three categories: Active, Passive, and Stat. Active skills must be selected using a contextual radial, and most deplete the character's energy pool by varying amounts to use. While most Active skills use the player's turn, there are a few exceptions, like Teleport and Leap Attack, which do not take a turn for the player. Passive skills are immediately applied to the player as permanent buffs when purchased. An example of this is Blood Bask, a skill possessed by the Skellyman Scoundrel class, which automatically returns health to the player when she attacks a monster that bleeds. Finally, Stat Skills boost a player stat, like Accuracy or Strength. \n",
      "Some Skills can be purchased subsequent times to boost the skill's effects. Holy Fires can be assigned up to three skill points, which increases the Skill's damage with each point. Fairy Blessing, a Skill that works by placing an Auto-Resurrection buff on the player, wears off unless purchased at a rate of once-per-death.\n",
      "\n",
      " Reception\n",
      "100 Rogues was received very well, getting 4 or 5 stars from most reviewers.  Complaints were mostly focused on the stability of the game on release;  several critics noted crashes or other bugs.  Dinofarm Games made very quick attempts to fix these issues and some reviewers have since tempered their reviews.\n",
