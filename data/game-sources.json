The two games were released in Japan on September 13, 2007, and were released in North America on April 20, 2008. They were released in Europe on July 4, 2008.\nThe game is very similar to its predecessors with the 'changing dungeon' aspect and story, but the story has more emphasis on exploration rather than rescuing. The story is also similar focusing on a human transformed into a Pokémon with amnesia with their partner Pokémon. Also like its predecessors, the game received mixed reviews for its graphics and repetitive gameplay, but the story was praised.\nAs a sequel to Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team, new features include the addition of Generation IV Pokémon, improved Wi-Fi functionality, and more touch-screen options. 491 of the 493 Pokémon are featured, as Shaymin and Arceus were not officially released at the time of the game's launch.\nA 21-minute TV special based on the game starring Kurumi Mamiya aired in Japan on September 9, 2007 as a content of the program relating Pokémon, \"Pokémon Sunday\" produced by TV Tokyo Corporation. It was later dubbed in English in 2008.",

    "Notes": "Full graphics, sound and music; sequel to *Strange Adventures in Infinite\nSpace*; plays to its conclusion in less than 30 minutes.",
    "Summary": "Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space, the sequel to Strange Adventures in Infinite Space, is a hybrid roguelike computer game created by the independent game development group, Digital Eel. In the game players explore a \"plausibly implausible\" (fictional) region of the Milky Way galaxy called \"The Purple Void\".\nLike its predecessor, Weird Worlds creates a new starmap each time the game is played. Stars, black holes, planets, nebulae, artifacts, alien patrols, gadgets, lifeforms and dozens of events and encounters are randomized intelligently for each game session.\nUnlike Strange Adventures, Weird Worlds allows the player to travel to black holes, using a device that protects the player (and the fleet) from the effects of intense gravity. One special mission even allows the player to enter a black hole to fight a nearly indestructible battlestation. Also, the \"Void\" is now more \"alive\" than before - most races encountered have a homeworld which also allows item trade.\nWeird Worlds features 3 mission types (scientist, pirate, military captain), 3 starmap sizes, 30 starship types and adversaries, dozens of different weapons, star drives, shields, shipboard systems, alien artifacts and lifeforms, realistic star and planet types, 10 unique alien races and a robust combat simulator.\nWeird Worlds was released for Microsoft Windows on November 4, 2005 by Digital Eel and Shrapnel Games. A Macintosh port was released on April 26, 2006. An iPad port was released January 5, 2010 and an Android version was released on March 20, 2013, both by Astraware Limited. An updated Macintosh port for OS X 10.9 Mavericks (or greater) that brought the Mac version up to date with the PC version was released on November 20, 2014 by Digital Eel.\nWeird Worlds won the Independent Games Festival Innovation in Audio award in 2006 [1].",

The goal is to obtain a Golden Apple on the bottom floor of the dungeon. There are 10 rooms per level in the low-res version, and 5 in the high-res version. The high-res versions may be played in low-res/text mode, thereby gaining this increase in level size.\nDespite being included in the \"roguelike\" genre, Beneath Apple Manor actually predates Rogue (created in 1980) by two years. The creator claims that neither he nor the implementors of Rogue knew about the other game.",

The player's aim is to stop the forces of Chaos that invade the world of Ancardia.\nLike most roguelikes, ADOM uses ASCII graphics to represent the game world. Recent versions optionally can be played using tile based graphics, soundtracks and sound effects.It features a wilderness map that connects different types of dungeons. Most dungeons are randomly generated on first entering. Once visited, they — with the exception of the Infinite Dungeon — do not change when re-entered during play.\nSince 2012, after a 9 year hiatus, development has been resumed by Thomas Biskup on ADOM as well as its successor ADOM II (a.k.a. JADE). Due to a crowdfunding campaign the latest versions are only available to those who participated, but version 1.2.0p23 has been made available for public download.",

The game is a spiritual sequel to the 2000 game Dark Cloud, with the same basic gameplay mechanics (action role-playing combined with elements of city-building games), but features mainly different characters and an unrelated plot.\nPlayers control two main protagonists, Max and Monica, who come from the present and future, respectively. The game's main antagonist is Emperor Griffon, who wishes to destroy the present from deep in the past. The game was well received by critics, and won several gaming awards.

A PlayStation Vita port was announced in February 2014. OS X and Linux versions premiered as part of a Humble Bundle in October 28, 2014.\nThe player controls the survivor of a space freighter crash on a strange planet. As the player progresses through levels, selected randomly and with some procedural placement of objects within the level, they attempt to survive by killing monsters and collecting items that can boost their offensive and defensive abilities. The game features a difficulty scale that increases with time, requiring the player to choose between spending time building experience and completing levels quickly before the monsters become more difficult. The game supports up to four cooperative players.",

    "Summary": "Rogue is a dungeon crawling video game first developed by Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman around 1980. It was a favorite on college Unix systems in the early to mid-1980s, in part due to the procedural generation of game content. Rogue popularized dungeon crawling as a video game trope, leading others to develop a class of derivatives known collectively as \"roguelikes\". For example, it directly inspired Hack, which in turn led to NetHack. Roguelikes have since influenced commercial games outside the genre, such as Diablo.",

The two games were released in Japan on September 13, 2007, and were released in North America on April 20, 2008. They were released in Europe on July 4, 2008.\nThe game is very similar to its predecessors with the 'changing dungeon' aspect and story, but the story has more emphasis on exploration rather than rescuing. The story is also similar focusing on a human transformed into a Pokémon with amnesia with their partner Pokémon. Also like its predecessors, the game received mixed reviews for its graphics and repetitive gameplay, but the story was praised.\nAs a sequel to Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team, new features include the addition of Generation IV Pokémon, improved Wi-Fi functionality, and more touch-screen options. 491 of the 493 Pokémon are featured, as Shaymin and Arceus were not officially released at the time of the game's launch.\nA 21-minute TV special based on the game starring Kurumi Mamiya aired in Japan on September 9, 2007 as a content of the program relating Pokémon, \"Pokémon Sunday\" produced by TV Tokyo Corporation. It was later dubbed in English in 2008.",

    "Summary": "FTL: Faster Than Light is a top-down, real-time strategy video game created by indie developer Subset Games. In the game, the player controls the crew of a single spacecraft, holding critical information to be delivered to an allied fleet eight sectors away, while being pursued by a large rebel fleet. The player must guide the spacecraft over a number of sectors, each with planetary systems and events procedurally generated in a roguelike fashion, while facing against rebel and other hostile forces, recruiting new crew, and outfitting and upgrading their ship. Combat takes place in pausable real time, and if the ship is destroyed or the crew lost, the game ends in permadeath, requiring the player to restart.\nThe concept for FTL was based on tabletop board games and other non-strategic space combat video games that required the player to manage an array of ship's functions. The initial development by the two-man Subset Games was self-funded, and guided towards developing entries for various indie game competitions. With positive responses from players and judges at these events, Subset opted to engage in a crowd-sourced Kickstarter campaign to finish the title, and succeeded in obtaining twenty times more than they had sought; the extra funds were used towards more professional art, music and in-game writing. The game, considered one of the major successes of the Kickstarter fundraisers for video games, was released in September 2012, to many positive reviews. An updated version, FTL: Advanced Edition adds more ships, events, and other gameplay elements, and was released on April 3, 2014 as a free update for existing owners as well as for purchase on iPad devices.",

    "Summary": "Mission: Thunderbolt is a roguelike computer game with a futuristic storyline. It was originally developed and released on DEC mainframes as Doomsday 2000, a four-part game, and later ported to both Mac OS and Windows. Mission: Thunderbolt is part 1 of the Jaunt Trooper series and was released on both Mac OS and Windows. Part 2, Mission: Firestorm, was only released for Mac OS. The game was one of the first commercially released roguelikes. It put a graphical front end and a full set of sounds in place of the ASCII text traditional to roguelikes. It was also unique in the sheer number of actions/interactions possible. Being closed source, many mysteries of the game were never fully resolved.",

    "Summary": "Izuna 2: The Unemployed Ninja Returns, released in Japan as Gōma Reifu Den Izuna Ni (降魔霊符伝イヅナ 弐), is a dungeon crawler video game developed by Ninja Studio and published in Japan by Success and in North America by Atlus for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It is the sequel to Izuna: Legend of the Unemployed Ninja and was released in Japan on November 29, 2007 and in North America on July 22, 2008.\nLike the first game, Izuna 2 focuses on the adventures of Izuna and her friends. Shino, Izuna's friend, disappears in the midst of a wedding, so Izuna goes on a quest to find her. Izuna finds her, only to discover that Shino was looking for her sister, Shizune, so Izuna and her group decide to help search for Shizune. But by looking for Shizune, Izuna angers a group of foreign gods, who attempt to prevent her from reuniting with Shizune.\nUpon release, Izuna 2 received mixed reviews. Aggregate review sites Metacritic and GameRankings gave the game a 65% and 63.56% respectively. Critics focused on its roguelike-nature as a as both a positive and a negative, and as the definitive aspect of the game. Most critics praised the storyline and criticized the gameplay, concluding that Izuna 2 will only appeal to roguelike or dungeon crawler fans.\n\n",

    "Summary": "Don't Starve is a 2013 action-adventure video game with survival and roguelike elements, developed and published by the indie company Klei Entertainment. The game was initially released via Valve's Steam software for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on April 23, 2013. A PlayStation 4 port became available the following year and further versions for iOS and mobile phones are under consideration. Downloadable content titled Reign of Giants was released on April 30, 2014, and a multiplayer expansion called Don't Starve Together was announced in May, and is currently in open beta testing.\nThe game follows a scientist named Wilson who finds himself in a dark, dreary world and must survive as long as possible. Toward this end, the player must keep Wilson healthy, fed, and mentally stable as he avoids a variety of surreal and supernatural enemies that will try to kill and devour him. The game's \"Adventure\" mode adds depth to the sparse plot and pits Wilson against the game's antagonist, Maxwell.\nDon't Starve was Klei's first foray into the survival genre. Conceived during the height of a game industry trend of dropping players into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival, the game was influenced by Minecraft, which spearheaded this trend, as well as by filmmaker Tim Burton. The game received positive reviews from critics; commended for its original art style, music, and variety of ways for the player to die, although its high level of difficulty and implementation of permanent death were less warmly received. Within the calendar year 2013, it sold over one million copies.",

    "Summary": "A dark nebula or absorption nebula is a type of interstellar cloud that is so dense it obscures the light from objects behind it, such as background stars and emission or reflection nebulae. The extinction of the light is caused by interstellar dust grains located in the coldest, densest parts of larger molecular clouds. Clusters and large complexes of dark nebulae are associated with Giant Molecular Clouds. Isolated small dark nebulae are called Bok globules. Like other interstellar dust or material, things it obscures are only visible using radio waves in radio astronomy or infrared in infrared astronomy.\nDark clouds appear so because of sub-micrometre-sized dust particles, coated with frozen carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which effectively block the passage of light at visible wavelengths. Also present are molecular hydrogen, atomic helium, C18O, CS, NH3 (ammonia), H2CO (formaldehyde), c-C3H2 (cyclopropenylidene) and a molecular ion N2H+ (diazenylium), all of which are relatively transparent. These clouds are the spawning grounds of stars and planets, and understanding their development is essential to understanding star formation.\nThe form of such dark clouds is very irregular: they have no clearly defined outer boundaries and sometimes take on convoluted serpentine shapes. The largest dark nebulae are visible to the naked eye, appearing as dark patches against the brighter background of the Milky Way like the Coalsack Nebula and the Great rift. These naked-eye objects are sometimes known as dark cloud constellations and take on a variety of names.\nIn the inner outer molecular regions of dark nebulae, important events take place, such as the formation of stars and masers.",

    "Notes": "",
    "Summary": "The Baroque (US /bəˈroʊk/ or UK /bəˈrɒk/) is often thought of as a period of artistic style that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance, theater, and music. The style began around 1600 in Rome, Italy and spread to most of Europe.\nThe popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Catholic Church, which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent, in response to the Protestant Reformation, that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement. The aristocracy also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumph, power and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence. However, \"baroque\" has resonance and application that extend beyond a simple reduction to either style or period.",

    "Notes": "",
    "Summary": "The Chocobo series is a collection of video games published by Square, and later by Square Enix, featuring a recurring creature from the Final Fantasy series, the Chocobo, as the protagonist. The creature is a large and normally flightless bird which first appeared in Final Fantasy II and has been featured in almost all subsequent Final Fantasy games, as well as making cameo appearances in numerous other games. The Chocobo series of video games contains over 20 titles for video game consoles, mobile phones, and online platforms. These games include installments of the Mystery Dungeon series of roguelike video games, racing games, adventure games, and minigame collections. Although the various games of the series have different game styles and are generally unrelated except by their inclusion of a Chocobo as the main character, Square Enix considers them to be a distinct series.\nThe first game in the series, Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon, is a Mystery Dungeon game released in 1997, while the latest is Chocobo no Chocotto Nouen, a 2012 farming game for the GREE mobile platform. A new game in the series, Chocobo Racing 3D, was cancelled in 2013. In addition to Square and Square Enix, the games have been developed by several other companies, including h.a.n.d., Bottle Cube, and Smile-Lab. Eight albums of music from Chocobo games have been produced and published by Square Enix, DigiCube, and Toshiba EMI, and an additional album of Chocobo-related music from both the Chocobo and Final Fantasy series, Compi de Chocobo, was released in 2013.",

    "Summary": "Strange Adventures In Infinite Space (SAIS) is a hybrid space roguelike computer game, and the first of its type. It was created by the independent game development group Digital Eel. In the game players explore a \"plausibly implausible\" (fictional) region of the Milky Way galaxy called The Purple Void.\nSAIS sets itself up differently each time it is played. Stars, black holes, planets, nebulae, artifacts, alien patrols, gadgets, lifeforms and dozens of events and encounters are randomized for each game session. Unlike conventional roguelikes, SAIS features graphics, music and sound, and game sessions typically last from 3 to 20 minutes, hence the game's tagline \"Explore the galaxy in 20 minutes or less!\"\nSAIS was released for Windows and Mac on March 15, 2002 by boardgame developer/publisher, Cheapass Games. It was later released for Pocket PC and Palm by British developer/publisher, Astraware.",

    "Summary": "Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time (ポケモン不思議のダンジョン 時の探検隊, Pokémon Fushigi no Danjon Toki no Tankentai, lit. \"Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Time Exploration Team\") and Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Darkness (ポケモン不思議のダンジョン 闇の探検隊, Pokémon Fushigi no Danjon Yami no Tankentai, lit. \"Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Darkness Exploration Team\") are a matched pair of Pokémon games for the Nintendo DS. The two games were released in Japan on September 13, 2007, and were released in North America on April 20, 2008. They were released in Europe on July 4, 2008.\nThe game is very similar to its predecessors with the 'changing dungeon' aspect and story, but the story has more emphasis on exploration rather than rescuing. The story is also similar focusing on a human transformed into a Pokémon with amnesia with their partner Pokémon. Also like its predecessors, the game received mixed reviews for its graphics and repetitive gameplay, but the story was praised.\nAs a sequel to Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team, new features include the addition of Generation IV Pokémon, improved Wi-Fi functionality, and more touch-screen options. 491 of the 493 Pokémon are featured, as Shaymin and Arceus were not officially released at the time of the game's launch.\nA 21-minute TV special based on the game starring Kurumi Mamiya aired in Japan on September 9, 2007 as a content of the program relating Pokémon, \"Pokémon Sunday\" produced by TV Tokyo Corporation. It was later dubbed in English in 2008.",

It is the second videogame in the Mystery Dungeon series, and the first game in the series to feature all original characters. It was originally released for the Super Famicom in 1995, and has subsequently been ported to the Game Boy and Nintendo DS.\nIn September 2007 Sega announced that they would release the DS version in North America. It was then released March 4, 2008.\nAlthough \"Shiren\" is the name of the primary character, the Japanese title is a pun; while \"Shiren the Wanderer\" is the official English title for the game, \"風来のシレン\" can also translate as \"The Wanderer's Ordeals\".",

    "Notes": "",
    "Summary": "Dwarf Fortress (officially called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress) is a part construction and management simulation, part roguelike, freeware indie video game created by Tarn and Zach Adams. In development since 2002, its first alpha version was released in 2006. The primary game mode is set in a procedurally generated fantasy world in which the player indirectly controls a group of dwarves and attempts to construct a successful and wealthy underground fortress. It received attention mainly for its complexity, difficulty and for it being a two-member project surviving solely on donations. It was selected in 2012 among other games to be featured in the Museum of Modern Art to show the history of video gaming.\nThe game uses text-based graphics and is open-ended with no main objectives. Before being played, the game has to generate worlds with continents, oceans and histories documenting civilizations and beasts; it is different each time the player starts from scratch. The main game mode, Fortress Mode, consists of selecting a suitable site from the generated-world, establishing the fortress, combating threats like goblin invasions and taking care of the dwarves. The second game mode, Adventure Mode, is a turn-based, open-ended roguelike. The combat system is anatomically detailed with combat logs describing organs getting pierced, fat getting bruised and limbs getting severed. The dwarves are modelled down to their individual personalities and by getting \"Strange Moods\", they can craft legendary artifacts. If not provided for properly, they get overwhelmed with negative thoughts causing a cascading deterioration of the fortress' population called a \"Tantrum Spiral\".\nPrior to Dwarf Fortress, Tarn Adams was working on a project called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood which was an isometric 3D role-playing game. Adams and his brother Zach started Bay 12 Games and released their games online. By 2004, Adams decided to shift from the original Armok to Dwarf Fortress after the former became difficult to maintain. He released the first alpha version and decided to rely only on PayPal donations. Adams stated that he is happy with donations, which remain stable but increase after a new version update. Adams calls Dwarf Fortress his life's work and said in 2011 that version 1.0 will not be ready for at least another 20 years, and even after that he would continue to work on it.\nThe game gained a cult following and creative interpretations of gameplay victories or losses were posted on various online forums. The game influenced Minecraft. Dwarf Fortress '​ emergent gameplay, text-based graphics, low commercial success, strange anecdotes like occasional heroic stories or intricate details were noted by the reviewers. Some described the difficulty from start as a steep learning curve—with the meaning of a difficult learning process. The Adams brothers answer crayon drawing requests and short stories for their donors. As there is no way to win the game, every fortress, no matter how successful usually gets destroyed somehow and to encourage experimenting further through this, prompted the unofficial community phrase: \"Losing is Fun!\"",

    "Summary": "Telengard is a 1982 role-playing dungeon crawler video game developed by Daniel Lawrence and published by Avalon Hill. The player explores a dungeon, fights monsters with magic, and avoids traps in real-time without any set mission other than surviving. Lawrence first wrote the game as DND, a 1976 version of Dungeons & Dragons for the DECsystem-10 mainframe computer. He continued to develop DND at Purdue University as a hobby, rewrote the game for the Commodore PET 2001 after 1978, and ported it to Apple II+, TRS-80, and Atari 800 platforms before Avalon Hill found the game at a convention and licensed it for distribution. Its Commodore 64 release was the most popular. Reviewers noted Telengard '​s similarity to Dungeons and Dragons. RPG historian Shannon Appelcline noted the game as one of the first professionally produced computer role-playing games, and Gamasutra '​s Barton considered Telengard consequential in what he deemed \"The Silver Age\" of computer role-playing games preceding the golden age of the late 1980s. Some of the game's dungeon features, such as altars, fountains, teleportation cubes, and thrones, were adopted by later games such as Tunnels of Doom.",

    "Summary": "In J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth, Angband (Sindarin for 'iron prison') is the name of the fortress of Melkor, constructed before the First Age, located in the Iron Mountains in the enemy's land Dor Daedeloth north of Beleriand.\nThe fortress is described in Tolkien's The Silmarillion. It was built by Melkor (later called Morgoth) to guard against a possible attack from Aman by the Valar. Nonetheless, the Valars' attack succeeded in capturing Morgoth and destroying his main stronghold Utumno.\nHowever, while the Valar had focused on destroying Utumno utterly, Angband, though devastated, was only partially destroyed. Over time, the dark creatures in Morgoth's service would gather in its ruined pits. After three ages of imprisonment, Morgoth returned to Middle-earth and set himself up in Angband, raising the volcanic Thangorodrim over the fortress as protection. He seldom came out of it again, but did when challenged to single combat by the Elven king Fingolfin and earlier to investigate the first appearance of Men. He reigned there until the end of the First Age, when it was destroyed in the War of Wrath. In earlier versions of Tolkien's mythology (see The History of Middle-earth) it was called Angamando, the Quenya form of the name.",

When this addiction becomes problematic, Bender joins the Temple of Robotology, but after Fry and Leela tempt Bender with alcohol and prostitutes, he quits the Temple of Robotology and is visited by the Robot Devil for sinning, and Bender is sent to Robot Hell. Finally Fry and Leela come to rescue him, and the three escape.\nThe episode introduces the Robot Devil, Reverend Lionel Preacherbot and the religion of the Temple of Robotology, a spoof on the Church of Scientology. The episode received positive reviews, and was one of four featured on the DVD boxed set of Matt Groening's favorite episodes: \"Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection\".",
