FTL: Faster Than Light,2012,"FTL: Faster Than Light is a top-down, real-time strategy video game created by indie developer Subset Games. In the game, the player controls the crew of a single spacecraft, holding critical information to be delivered to an allied fleet eight sectors away, while being pursued by a large rebel fleet. The player must guide the spacecraft over a number of sectors, each with planetary systems and events procedurally generated in a roguelike fashion, while facing against rebel and other hostile forces, recruiting new crew, and outfitting and upgrading their ship. Combat takes place in pausable real time, and if the ship is destroyed or the crew lost, the game ends in permadeath, requiring the player to restart.
The concept for FTL was based on tabletop board games and other non-strategic space combat video games that required the player to manage an array of ship's functions. The initial development by the two-man Subset Games was self-funded, and guided towards developing entries for various indie game competitions. With positive responses from players and judges at these events, Subset opted to engage in a crowd-sourced Kickstarter campaign to finish the title, and succeeded in obtaining twenty times more than they had sought; the extra funds were used towards more professional art, music and in-game writing. The game, considered one of the major successes of the Kickstarter fundraisers for video games, was released in September 2012, to many positive reviews. An updated version, FTL: Advanced Edition adds more ships, events, and other gameplay elements, and was released on April 3, 2014 as a free update for existing owners as well as for purchase on iPad devices.","WIN, LIN, OSX","['FTL', 'Faster Than Light']",Subset Games,"2D Dungeon exploration styled after space travel.

Slaves to Armok II: Dwarf Fortress,2006,"Dwarf Fortress (officially called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress) is a part construction and management simulation, part roguelike, freeware indie video game created by Tarn and Zach Adams. In development since 2002, its first alpha version was released in 2006. The primary game mode is set in a procedurally generated fantasy world in which the player indirectly controls a group of dwarves and attempts to construct a successful and wealthy underground fortress. It received attention mainly for its complexity, difficulty and for it being a two-member project surviving solely on donations. It was selected in 2012 among other games to be featured in the Museum of Modern Art to show the history of video gaming.
The game uses text-based graphics and is open-ended with no main objectives. Before being played, the game has to generate worlds with continents, oceans and histories documenting civilizations and beasts; it is different each time the player starts from scratch. The main game mode, Fortress Mode, consists of selecting a suitable site from the generated-world, establishing the fortress, combating threats like goblin invasions and taking care of the dwarves. The second game mode, Adventure Mode, is a turn-based, open-ended roguelike. The combat system is anatomically detailed with combat logs describing organs getting pierced, fat getting bruised and limbs getting severed. The dwarves are modelled down to their individual personalities and by getting ""Strange Moods"", they can craft legendary artifacts. If not provided for properly, they get overwhelmed with negative thoughts causing a cascading deterioration of the fortress' population called a ""Tantrum Spiral"".
Prior to Dwarf Fortress, Tarn Adams was working on a project called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood which was an isometric 3D role-playing game. Adams and his brother Zach started Bay 12 Games and released their games online. By 2004, Adams decided to shift from the original Armok to Dwarf Fortress after the former became difficult to maintain. He released the first alpha version and decided to rely only on PayPal donations. Adams stated that he is happy with donations, which remain stable but increase after a new version update. Adams calls Dwarf Fortress his life's work and said in 2011 that version 1.0 will not be ready for at least another 20 years, and even after that he would continue to work on it.
The game gained a cult following and creative interpretations of gameplay victories or losses were posted on various online forums. The game influenced Minecraft. Dwarf Fortress '​ emergent gameplay, text-based graphics, low commercial success, strange anecdotes like occasional heroic stories or intricate details were noted by the reviewers. Some described the difficulty from start as a steep learning curve—with the meaning of a difficult learning process. The Adams brothers answer crayon drawing requests and short stories for their donors. As there is no way to win the game, every fortress, no matter how successful usually gets destroyed somehow and to encourage experimenting further through this, prompted the unofficial community phrase: ""Losing is Fun!""","LIN, OSX, WIN",['Dwarf Fortress'],Tarn Adams,,Fantasy

The fortress is described in Tolkien's The Silmarillion. It was built by Melkor (later called Morgoth) to guard against a possible attack from Aman by the Valar. Nonetheless, the Valars' attack succeeded in capturing Morgoth and destroying his main stronghold Utumno.

Dark Cloud,2000,"A dark nebula or absorption nebula is a type of interstellar cloud that is so dense it obscures the light from objects behind it, such as background stars and emission or reflection nebulae. The extinction of the light is caused by interstellar dust grains located in the coldest, densest parts of larger molecular clouds. Clusters and large complexes of dark nebulae are associated with Giant Molecular Clouds. Isolated small dark nebulae are called Bok globules. Like other interstellar dust or material, things it obscures are only visible using radio waves in radio astronomy or infrared in infrared astronomy.
Dark clouds appear so because of sub-micrometre-sized dust particles, coated with frozen carbon monoxide and nitrogen, which effectively block the passage of light at visible wavelengths. Also present are molecular hydrogen, atomic helium, C18O, CS, NH3 (ammonia), H2CO (formaldehyde), c-C3H2 (cyclopropenylidene) and a molecular ion N2H+ (diazenylium), all of which are relatively transparent. These clouds are the spawning grounds of stars and planets, and understanding their development is essential to understanding star formation.
The form of such dark clouds is very irregular: they have no clearly defined outer boundaries and sometimes take on convoluted serpentine shapes. The largest dark nebulae are visible to the naked eye, appearing as dark patches against the brighter background of the Milky Way like the Coalsack Nebula and the Great rift. These naked-eye objects are sometimes known as dark cloud constellations and take on a variety of names.

Baroque,1998,"The Baroque (US /bəˈroʊk/ or UK /bəˈrɒk/) is often thought of as a period of artistic style that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance, theater, and music. The style began around 1600 in Rome, Italy and spread to most of Europe.
The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Catholic Church, which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent, in response to the Protestant Reformation, that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement. The aristocracy also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumph, power and control.

The game's ""Adventure"" mode adds depth to the sparse plot and pits Wilson against the game's antagonist, Maxwell.
Don't Starve was Klei's first foray into the survival genre.
