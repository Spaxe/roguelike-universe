      "ToeJam & Earl is an action game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console. Released in 1991, it centers on ToeJam and Earl—alien rappers who have crash-landed on Earth. As they attempt to escape the planet, players assume the role of either character and collect pieces of their wrecked spacecraft. ToeJam & Earl's design was heavily influenced by the role-playing video game Rogue, and took from it such features as the random generation of levels and items. It references and parodies 1980s and early 90s urban culture and is set to a funk soundtrack.\nThe game was positively received by critics, who praised its originality, soundtrack, humor and two-player cooperative mode. It attained sleeper hit status despite low initial sales, and its protagonists were used as mascots by Sega. ToeJam & Earl was followed by two sequels: ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron and ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, released for the Sega Genesis and Xbox, respectively. The sequels' commercial and critical success was mixed. A fourth title, ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove, is currently in development with funds from Kickstarter. The game was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in December 2006 and re-released again on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in November 2012.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nToeJam & Earl has been called a surreal, comic satire, and a \"daringly misanthropic commentary on Earthly life\". ToeJam is red and has three legs. Earl is fat and orange. ToeJam wears a large gold medallion and a backwards baseball cap, while Earl is marked by high-tops and oversized sunglasses; both outfits are \"over-the-top appropriations\" of 1990s urban culture. Their speech features California slang. The game is set to a soundtrack which has been described both as jazz-funk, and as hip hop. For the game's unique sound, composer John Baker was inspired by Herbie Hancock and The Headhunters.In the game's opening sequence, ToeJam explains that Earl's erratic piloting abilities have resulted in a crash-landing on planet Earth. He says that they must find the widely scattered pieces of their spacecraft's wreckage to return to their home planet, Funkotron. The player guides the characters as they avoid Earth's antagonistic inhabitants and search for the debris. Should the player succeed, the final sequence depicts ToeJam and Earl escaping the planet in their reconstructed spacecraft. Under the player's control, the characters proceed across a purple landscape that represents Funkotron, and are greeted by their friends and family.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nToeJam & Earl takes place from a 3/4 perspective in a 2D game world. Its gameplay mechanics were inspired by Rogue, which has led to its description as a Roguelike or dungeon-crawl game. The game contains both single-player and two-player cooperative modes. The latter displays a single screen when both characters are near each other, but splits it apart when they are not. Playing the game with two players reveals dialogue and jokes between the characters not heard in the single player game.The game is set on Earth, which is represented by randomly generated islands that float in space, each one a layer above the last. They are connected by elevators. Some islands contain pieces of spacecraft wreckage, of which the player must collect 10 to win the game. The player character drops to the island below if he falls from an island's edge, which necessitates that the player again locate an elevator. Each island is populated by antagonistic \"Earthlings\", such as phantom ice-cream trucks, aggressive packs of \"nerds\", giant hamsters, Bogeymen, man-eating mailboxes, and chickens armed with mortars that shoot tomatoes. Certain Earthlings aid the player. The game has been described as \"largely non-violent\", as the protagonists can only attack enemies with thrown tomatoes—one of many temporary, randomly generated power-ups.Power-ups are contained in wrapped presents, which are categorized by appearance. The contents of a present are unknown to the player until it is opened; afterwards, all presents of that appearance are identified. Presents with question marks can hold any item at random, so their contents cannot be identified on sight alone. Identification of presents' contents is a central gameplay mechanic. Each power-up has a unique effect: while one might increase the player characters' running speed, another distracts enemies. Certain presents contain harmful power-ups, such the loss of a \"life\", or the \"Randomizer\", which resets the identity of all presents. In the game's cooperative mode, if one player character opens a present in the vicinity of the other, its contents affect both characters. As players open more presents, the chances of accidentally opening the Randomizer are increased, which prevents the game from becoming easier as more presents are identified.\n\n\n== Development ==\nToeJam & Earl creator Greg Johnson became a fan of Rogue as a university student. After he left university, he worked on games for Electronic Arts, including Starflight (1986). After the completion of Starflight 2, Johnson conceived ToeJam & Earl—first the characters, then the plot—while on a beach in Hawaii. The idea was a combination of Rogue's gameplay concepts and a lighter version of Starflight's science-fiction themes. Johnson met programmer Mark Voorsanger through a mutual friend, while walking on Mount Tam in 1989. He related the concept of ToeJam & Earl to Voorsanger, and the two resolved to make the game together. They formed Johnson Voorsanger Productions, and serious work on the game began soon after. Their status as commercial game designers allowed them to meet with Sega of America, and they used cards covered in landscape drawings to demonstrate their idea of randomly generated levels. Sega marketing manager Hugh Bowen was immediately interested in the concept and he enlisted the aid of producer Scott Berfield to sell the game to management; Sega wanted innovative games and new mascots to compete with Nintendo.The game's small development team was composed of Johnson's previous colleagues, and its music was composed by John Baker. The team's goal was to make a humorous game that was \"original, easy to understand and offered an immediate response to the player's actions\". The designers wanted to include a two-player mode so that they could play together, and considered ToeJam & Earl \"a two player game with a one player option.\" While Sega believed that hardware issues would prevent the feature from working, Voorsanger successfully implemented it. In a 1992 interview with Sega Visions, Johnson stated that the characters ToeJam and Earl evolved as reflections of his and Voorsanger's personalities. Voorsanger disagreed, and called the characters \"two different aspects of Greg's personality\". Steve Purcell has stated that he contributed character designs to the game.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nToeJam & Earl received positive reviews, which Bill Paris of UGO described as \"almost unanimous critical acclaim\". However, Sega deemed it a commercial failure due to low initial sales. The game built a cult following through word of mouth, and it was further aided by the Sega Genesis's Christmas 1991 sales spike, caused by the release of Sonic the Hedgehog. ToeJam & Earl was later considered a \"cult\" success. According to Ken Horowitz (2016, p. 74) author of Playing the Next Level: A History of American Sega Games, \"In all, the game sold 350,000 copies for Sega, a remarkable feat for such an unconventional title on a fledgling console.\"Mean Machines found the game addictive and original, but found fault with its slow-paced combat. One of the reviewers said, \"Not everyone will like it—it's not normal enough for mass appeal—but I think it's destined to become a massive cult classic\". GamePro called the game's originality \"incredible\", and praised its graphics, music and humor. MegaTech praised the graphics, and the 2-player option, and said the game was \"great fun - pure and simple\".\nMega said that it was \"An OK game, but one which becomes completely essential when played with someone else. Got any friends? Buy this. Haven't got any friends? Buy this and make some\". The game also appeared at number 26 on its list of the best games of all time. Entertainment Weekly praised the \"absolutely hilarious\" sound effects and music. Jeff Csatari of Boys' Life called it \"another hot game\" for the Sega Genesis, alongside Sonic the Hedgehog. Ed Martinez of Game Informer commended the game's soundtrack and unique concept, but found it to be too easy.A review published in both the Chicago Tribune and Rome News-Tribune likened ToeJam and Earl to \"an outer-space, rap version of Abbott and Costello\". The reviewers called it \"the funniest game we've seen in a long time\", and praised its soundtrack, graphics and action.The Toronto Star acclaimed the game's \"hilariously designed split-screen two-player mode\", and said, \"If you've got a Sega-Genesis system, you simply must check out [this] awesome rap 'n' roll game\". Sega Visions praised the game's \"no-repetitive action\" and said, \"This is the zaniest game that ever rocked Sega's Genesis system.\" Several months after the game's release, Mega ranked it the 13th best Sega Genesis game in its All-Time Top 100 feature. The magazine praised the game's \"superbly manic and zany action\", and deemed it both \"original and insane\". The Channel 4 video game programme GamesMaster gave the game a 70% rating.\nToeJam & Earl was re-released on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console in 2006. Official Nintendo Magazine scored the game 85%, and praised its humor, originality and two-player mode. However, the reviewer believed that the game's enjoyability had diminished with time. GameSpot felt that the game's 1990s idioms were dated, but that the gameplay—particularly the two-player mode—was still enjoyable by modern standards. Jeremy Parish of 1UP found the game's two-player co-operative mode more enjoyable than its single-player, and described the graphics and sound as \"oddly primitive\". Parish considered it \"one of the best games to hit VC to date\". Eurogamer's reviewer negatively received the game, and believed its gameplay to be unsatisfying and overly slow. IGN called the game's visuals a \"mixed bag\" and derided the slow pace, but praised its unpredictability and believed that its sound design was \"one thing you absolutely can't fault\".\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nToeJam and Earl became \"one of Sega's second tier mascots, alongside Sonic\", and one of the Sega Genesis's \"key exclusive franchises\". The characters appeared in a spin-off light gun game, Ready, Aim, Tomatoes, developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions as one of six mini-games for the Menacer 6-game cartridge. In early 1992, the developers began work on a sequel to ToeJam & Earl, and spent three months expanding on the original game's concept by adding indoor areas and more terrain types. Sega was not impressed by the sequel, and believed it to be unmarketable. The team redesigned it as a platform game, as Sega was inclined to publish games in this genre. The game, titled ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, was highly anticipated, and was a commercial and critical success when it released in 1993. However, fans of the original game were disappointed by the change in design to a perceived generic style. Due to poor North American sales of the Sega Saturn, Sega's next generation video game console, the ToeJam & Earl franchise was neglected. A ToeJam & Earl game planned for the Dreamcast was cancelled (a beta of the game was preserved, and on Christmas Day 2013 released on the internet by enthusiasts), but a third installment, ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, was released for the Xbox in 2002. The release returned to the concepts of the original game, but generated mixed reviews and poor sales. A new ToeJam & Earl game is currently in development by HumaNature Studios.ToeJam & Earl has been called \"weird\", \"strange\", and \"thoroughly odd\". Critics have difficulty in determining a genre for the game; it has been called a platform game and Roguelike, as well as action and action-adventure. While ToeJam & Earl's success did not match that of the Sega Genesis's other popular titles, it has been considered a \"classic\", and a \"cult\" game. Prior to ToeJam & Earl III's conception, research by its developers found that the original ToeJam & Earl was preferred over its sequel. In an IGN survey, 65% of respondents cited it as their favorite of the three games. The game was set to be re-released on Xbox Live Arcade after winning a poll arranged by Sega, but this became uncertain because Johnson owns the rights to the characters rather than Sega. The game, along with its sequel, was announced as part of Sega Vintage Collection series for release on November 7, 2012, to be released individually on PlayStation Network and as a collection on Xbox Live Arcade. The notion of a ToeJam & Earl game for the Nintendo DS failed to generate interest from publishers, but Johnson has reiterated the possibility of such a game in the future.  Greg Johnson would later be able to give Toejam and Earl a comeback with a new game called Toejam & Earl: Back in the Groove, which was made by his own independent game developing company HumaNature Studios, and was also made possible by Kickstarter fundraising.  Greg Johnson said he was able to make a new ToeJam and Earl game without needing a publisher, since the popularity of downloadable independent games, but Adult Swim Games came to publish the game as well as for retail copies.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nToeJam & Earl Productions: Developer's official website\nToeJam & Earl's Virtual Console site",
      "ToeJam & Earl Productions was an American video game developer. Founders Mark Voorsanger and Greg Johnson started the company in 1989.At the beginning, the company was known simply as Johnson Voorsanger Productions, or just \"JVP\" as they were credited in the original ToeJam & Earl and in its sequel Panic on Funkotron. After the success of the ToeJam & Earl games, the company was renamed into the more iconic brand of ToeJam & Earl Productions.JVP introduced the ToeJam & Earl series with the original ToeJam & Earl, followed by Ready-Aim-Tomatoes (a mini-game for Sega's light-gun The Menacer), and the platformer-sequel ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron. Each was developed exclusively for the Mega Drive/Sega Genesis and published by Sega of America.  The latest title in the series was ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, co-developed by Visual Concepts for the original Xbox.ToeJam & Earl Productions also created Orly's Draw-A-Story, a multi-award-winning CD-ROM for kids ages 5 to 10. Orly's Draw-A-Story was designed for PCs and Macs and was published by Broderbund.The company was forced to disband after poor sales of ToeJam & Earl III.[1] Mark Voorsanger currently runs a coaching business out of the same building where ToeJam & Earl Productions was and Greg Johnson started his own video game development studio called HumaNature Studios, and currently owns the ToeJam & Earl intellectual property rights.[1][2][3] Greg Johnson currently has a Nintendo DS game in development, but he has not found a publisher yet.[4]vte\nToeJam & Earl video gamesGames\nToeJam & Earl · ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron · ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to EarthRelated\nReady, Aim, Tomatoes! · ToeJam & Earl ProductionsToeJam & Earl · ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron · ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to EarthReady, Aim, Tomatoes! · ToeJam & Earl Productions",
      "ToeJam & Earl (トージャム＆アール) is an action game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions, and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive. It stars two extraterrestrial rappers who, by way of pilot error, end up crash-landing on Earth. While there, they must search for the missing pieces of their spacecraft in hopes of reassembling it. The game frequently parodies and satirizes 1990s urban culture, and includes common 90s slang and a funk soundtrack. Much of this charm is what drew people toward the game. The game was followed by ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron.The game takes place in a surreal isometric world representing Earth, where land is in the form of a stack of randomly-generated floating islands. In each of the game's 25 island, the player must find the elevator that will bring them to the next level. Occasionally, a rocketship piece will be hidden somewhere on an island, although the player is not required to collect it right away before moving onto the next island. Every island besides the first is surrounded by a void, falling in at any time will cause the player to fall to the previous level.Presents are scattered around the island that can be collected and used at any time. The effects of each present box are randomized each time the game is played. Some presents have helpful effects, such as restoring health, temporarily bestowing special abilities, or revealing hidden sections of the map. Others, however, can do more harm, and can do things such as summon enemies, cause the character to fall asleep and leave them open to attack, or randomize the effects of all the presents.While most inhabitants of Earth will attack or otherwise hinder Toejam & Earl when they spot them, some will help them in exchange for money. The man in the carrot suit will identify presents, and the wizard will fully restore a character's health. On occasion, Santa Claus can be found, if the player is successful in sneaking up to him without alerting him, he will drop a few random presents.The player has a rank shown on the bottom of the screen with their health and number of extra lives, and begins the game at the rank of 'Weiner'. As the player scores points by uncovering squares of the map and opening presents, their rank will increase at certain point values. When the player increases in rank, their maximum health increases, and for every second increase in rank, the player receives an extra life. The player is able to increase in rank eight times.The game can either be played with one or two players. In two-player mode, if Toejam & Earl wander too far apart, the game will go into a horizontal split-screen so both players can keep track of their characters, with the screen returning to normal once the characters reunite. If Toejam & Earl walk into each other, they will high-five, causing the player with the most health to give a little to the player with less health. If one player loses all of their lives, they can also take a life from the other player to come back into the game.The game ends when the player finds all 10 pieces of the spacecraft.sneaks and causes a character to use a present's special ability, when applicable.  pulls up an item screen.  switches to a map of the current island.One of Greg Johnson's main influences for the design of ToeJam & Earl, was the video game Rogue[16], a dungeon crawling video game, developed around 1980 for Unix-based mainframe systems and released as public domain software, a game that Greg Johnson first played while studiyng bio-linguistics at the University of California in San Diego, staying up to early hours of the morning playing it.n/aSteam manual#27: \"October 1991\" (1991-xx-xx)#119: \"October 1991\" (1991-09-15)#11: \"September 1993\" (1993-07-30)#9: \"Abril 1992\" (1992-04-xx)Sega Retro is part of the Backwards Compatible family of sites, which are dedicated to research and preservation of gaming history and culture.Donate | Privacy Policy | About Sega Retro | ContactExcept where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.Publisher: SegaDeveloper: Johnson Voorsanger ProductionsSystem(s): Sega Mega Drive, Virtual Console, PlayStation Network, SteamGenre: ActionNumber of players: 1-2Release \n Date \n RRP \n Code\n\n\n  JP \n 1992-03-13 \n ¥6,800 \n G-4066\n\n\n  US \n 1991-10[2][3] \n $59.95[1] \n 1020\n\n\n  CA \n 199x \n $? \n 1020\n\n\n  UK \n 1991-11 \n £34.99[4][5] \n 1020\n\n\n  FR \n 1991-11 \n ?F \n 1020\n\n\n  DE \n 1991-11 \n DM ? \n 1020\n\n\n  ES \n 1991-11 \n ?Ptas \n 1020\n\n\n  AU \n 199x \n $? \n ?\n\n\n  BR \n 199x \n R$? \n ?\n\n\n  KR \n 199x \n ₩? \n GM8027JG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  JP \n 2006-12-02[7] \n 600[6] pts \n ?\n\n\n  US \n 2006-12-25[8] \n 800[8] pts \n ?\n\n\n  EU \n 2006-12-22[9] \n 800[9] pts \n ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  US \n 2011-01-26[11] \n $4.99[10] \n 71166\n\n\n  EU \n 2011-01-26[11] \n €4.49[10] \n 71166\n\n\n  UK \n 2011-01-26[11] \n £3.99[10] \n 71166\n\n\n  AU \n 2011-01-26[11] \n $6.99[10] \n 71166\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  US ▼\n\n 2012-11-06[12]\n\n $4.99[12]\n\n NPUB-30796\n\n\n\n\n  EU ▼\n\n 2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[13]\n\n €4.49[12]\n\n NPEB-01001\n\n\n\n\n  UK ▼\n\n 2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[13]\n\n £3.59[12]\n\n NPEB-01001\n\n\n\n\n  AU ▼\n\n 2012-11-06[12]\n\n $6.25[12]\n\n NPEB-01001\n\n\n\n\n  KR ▼\n\n 2012-11-07[14]\n\n ₩6,200[14]\n\n NPHB-00500\n\n\n\n\n  TW ▼\n\n 2012-11-07[15]\n\n NT$156[15]\n\n NPHB-00500JP1992-03-13¥6,800G-4066US1991-10[2][3]$59.95[1]1020CA199x$?1020UK1991-11£34.99[4][5]1020FR1991-11?F1020DE1991-11DM ?1020ES1991-11?Ptas1020AU199x$??BR199xR$??KR199x₩?GM8027JGJP2006-12-02[7]600[6] pts?US2006-12-25[8]800[8] pts?EU2006-12-22[9]800[9] pts?US2011-01-26[11]$4.99[10]71166EU2011-01-26[11]€4.49[10]71166UK2011-01-26[11]£3.99[10]71166AU2011-01-26[11]$6.99[10]71166US ▼2012-11-06[12]$4.99[12]NPUB-30796EU ▼2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[13]€4.49[12]NPEB-01001UK ▼2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[13]£3.59[12]NPEB-01001AU ▼2012-11-06[12]$6.25[12]NPEB-01001KR ▼2012-11-07[14]₩6,200[14]NPHB-00500TW ▼2012-11-07[15]NT$156[15]NPHB-00500ESRBPEGIOFLCCEROTrivia sections are badTry and incorporate this information into the main article.

      "ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron is a platform video game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega in 1993 for the Sega Genesis. The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth.The game follows on the events of the first game, in which funky aliens ToeJam and Earl crash landed on Earth. After managing to rebuild their spaceship and returning safely to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo soon learn that a bunch of Earthlings had stowed away on their craft and have now invaded Funkotron.[3] With the humans spreading panic across the planet's citizens, even scaring the source of all funk, Lamont the Funkapotomus, away to another dimension, it is up to ToeJam and Earl to clean up the mess they've made and send all the Earthlings they brought with them back to where they came from.After the success of the original game, Johnson Voorsanger Productions began work on a sequel in 1992. The developer spent three to four months building on the original mechanics, adding elements such as indoor areas and additional terrain types, though the randomly generated levels were removed. The plot of this prototype would see ToeJam and Earl \"return to Earth to stage a rap concert, only to find they've lost their CDs\" which would form the basis of the game's treasure hunt.

The game employed a larger development team than the first installment and was originally projected for a Christmas 1992 release, and titled ToeJam & Earl 2. Sega however conferred that they did not \"understand\" the game and though the \"decision was still ultimately with Johnson and Voorsanger\", the developer started work on a more generic side-scrolling platform game, a concept to which Sega had been more receptive. The increased size of the game's cartridge over the original allowed for greater graphical detail. The soundtrack, including the original theme, was remixed and given a more layered quality.Unlike its predecessor, Panic on Funkotron is a side-scrolling platform game in which up to two players play as ToeJam and Earl as they travel across Funkotron to capture antagonistic Earthlings that had stowed away.[6] Players accomplish this by using a radar to locate an Earthling's proximity (some Earthlings may be hidden in the environment) and attack them with jars in order to trap and collect them. Once all Earthlings have been found, the player can move on to the next level.[7] Players can collect presents containing various bonuses, such as super jars, radar scans, and teleporting moves. Coins can be used with parking meters to trigger events in the environment or participate in minigames such as Jam Outs and Fungus Olympics. Players can also enter gateways leading to the Hyper Funk Zone, where the player must avoid obstacles in order to earn more presents. Hidden throughout the game are ten objects belonging to Lamont the Funkapotamus; collecting all of which will earn the player the best ending upon completion.",

ToeJam & Earl took the Genesis by storm with its seamless mix of hip-hop beats, random levels, and simultaneous two-player gameplay. A true Genesis classic, it set a standard for multi-player games that has withstood the test of time.Say what you will about the character designs (which are entirely appropriate given the context of the game), or the basic gameplay, but you simply cannot ignore the charm and appeal this series has. It will make you laugh out loud, and before you know it, hours have passed and all you’ve done is collect bucks and try out different presents. Yet in spite of all of this, you’ve still had a ball. That is the inherent charm of this franchise, and everything else takes a backseat to this single, guiding concept.Game designers Mark Voorsanger and Greg Johnson formed TJ&E Productions in 1989. Voorsanger, who had a degree in electrical engineering and computer science, had been in the industry for some time. Early in his career, he programmed for Fathom for the Colecovision and Demon Attack for the Tandy Computer. As a lead programmer for the NEMO project at Hasbro, he was involved with the development of the first full-motion interactive games for in-home use, which eventually became the controversial Sega CD title Night Trap. Voorsanger has also served as a consultant for software development with companies such as LucasArts Entertainment, Activision, and Accolade.Greg Johnson started in the industry over twenty years ago and has been at the helm of a number of successful titles, like Starflight and Starflight II. Along with his career as a designer, he writes children’s stories and designs board games.As a team, both Voorsanger and Johnson have released three games in the ToeJam & Earl series, as well as an award-winning children’s CD-ROM titled Orly’s Draw-A-Story for PCs and Macs.When Sega went looking for a mascot, they accepted and rejected several submissions. Of all of them, Voorsanger and Johnson’s creation was the closest to being accepted. Though Sega initially considered the game “too American” to be mascot material, but they weren’t blind to the game’s charm and appeal. Billed by the media as the game to own (before a certain blue hedgehog made his debut), ToeJam & Earl was a hit.Released in 1991, the original ToeJam & Earl initially left gamers scratching their collective heads. What was this? A game from Sega that starred two rapping aliens? It seemed to far-fetched to be true. Yet as they took hold of their control pads and actually began to play, the questions were transformed into laughter, and the addictive gameplay took over.The most likely reason for its success was its innovative two-player design. Both you and a friend could take the reigns of either alien and funk-a-fy each stage either cooperatively or spit up, and explore on your own. The screen was wisely set up for this, and split horizontally to allow you to see what your pal was doing as you went on your merry way. No other Genesis game (or on any console, for that matter) allowed such freedom for two players at the same time, and TJ&E pulled it off flawlessly.The story was simple: ToeJam and Earl’s spaceship crash lands on Earth and is blown into several pieces. As they try to recover and repair their ship, the duo is assaulted by several weird and dangerous humans, including the Boogey Man, Insane Dentist, and even Santa himself! Our heroes weren’t totally defenseless though, and had several silly weapons of their own with which to fight off the strange and hostile natives. Presents held goodies such as rocket skates for speed, Icarus wings to fly, and spring shoes for high jumping. Collecting money (bucks) allowed you to send off for more presents or even pay certain characters, like the wizard or opera singer to do you favors (get your mind out of the gutter there, slugger). The wizard healed you, while opera’s favorite fat lady eliminated any baddies on-screen with a multi-octave asault.As you progressed and collected presents, you earned points that raised your “cool meter.” The boys started out with the undesirable title of Weiner and worked up to Funklord, slowly raising their health bar with each new title. Points were earned by opening presents or by finding terrain tiles (purple tiles covering the map). Should a tile be uncovered with both characters onscreen, both would receive points for the effort.Humor was the central theme to ToeJam & Earl, and almost everything was geared to make you laugh. For instance, the Boogey Man would cry “boogey! boogey! boogey!” as he approached you, and hordes of tomato-launching chickens roamed the landscape, looking for their next target. Even just leaving ToeJam or Earl idle for a time would have them fall asleep, only to be awaken by a screaming narrator. You could literally play for days and not find all the kooky presents or meet all the weird inhabitants of the game’s massive (for the time) worlds.Soon after the initial game’s release, both ToeJam and Earl appeared in the 1992 6-in-1 cart that was included along with the Genesis’ flexible new light gun, the Menacer. A short mini game titled Ready, Aim, Tomatoes! allowed the gamer to act as the duo, armed with a tomato blaster that splattered enemies and racked up points. More of a cameo appearance than part of the continuity, it was the one bright spot in an otherwise tepid selection of mini games.Things didn’t end there, though. Sega quickly followed up on TE&E‘s success and authorized a sequel. Johnson and Voorsanger quickly began work on a game that was similar in concept to the original but added several new elements, like the ability to enter buildings and caves. Sega executives couldn’t identify with what had made ToeJam & Earl so special and felt that a side scrolling platformer would be more marketable. Rather than have their game shelved, the team decided to scrap their initial build and begin again from scratch.Panic on Funkotron hit the stores in 1993 to mixed reviews. Gamers still loved the characters and their crazy antics, but struggled to adjust to the new style of play. The humor remained intact, although it didn’t quite mesh with the new dynamic as well as it had with the original. Still, it was a new TJ&E game, and it benefited from better advertising. Sega of America, however, had yet to catch on to its appeal, and merely viewed it as another original title to add to the Genesis line up.A direct sequel, Panic saw ToeJam and Big Earl finally return home to Funkotron. To their dismay, several Earthlings had stowed away aboard their ship, and proceeded to wreak havoc across the planet. Seventeen stages awaited, as the funky friends tried to clean up the mess they had made. Presents were still the weapon of choice but the new Funkscan helped identify hidden passages, humans, and items. Moreover, you had to capture each human by flinging jars at them. Some required more jars than others, which made a few humans (construction workers, for example), a bit harder to snag. The cast was expanded as well, and we finally got to meet some of the other inhabitants of Funkotron, like the giggling Peabo and the food-loving Bloona. They helped you throughout the game and made the TJ&E universe more solid and convincing.After Panic on Funkotron, the series disappeared for almost a decade, and both Johnson and Voorsanger moved on to other projects, including ePlanet – a company dedicated to developing new vision-based technology and to creating ground breaking vision-enabled software products. However, in 2002, the duo returned to the franchise and began working on another installment that would eventualy appear exclusively on the Xbox. Initially, it was slated for a release on Sega’s Dreamcast but was transferred over when it became clear that the console was not long for this world. The version in progress for that system was coming along nicely, and even had online play for up to three characters (*sigh*, what could have been…). Unfortunately, this feature had to be scrapped when the game changed platforms. As for the change itself, why the Xbox and not the GameCube or more successful PS2? Their website summed it up best:In ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, our heroes returned to the planet that had started it all. Alongside Latisha, a sharp-witted character who was playable from the get-go, TJ and Earl were tasked with finding the Twelve Sacred Albums of Funk, which had been stolen from the ruler of Funkotron- Lamont.Part three went back to the open level layout of the first game but connected everything together to a central hub. This was something Johnson would come to regret later, as he believed it made the random levels less important. Nonetheless, going back to the original concept was a move appreciated by fans and critics alike.Taking advantage of the incredible power of Xbox, Mission to Earth featured a fully-realized 3D world (complete with changing time of day and moving shadows), Dolby 5.1 digital sound with full voice work, and CG cut scenes to progress the story. Without a doubt though, its best feature had to be its use of Xbox Live. Back in 2002, Live was something everyone liked and no one took advantage of, and TJ&E 3 was one of the first titles to reward gamers with downloadable content. Three new characters and two new levels extended the playtime of an already great title.Gameplay was very much reminiscent of the first ToeJam & Earl, and this basically went one of two ways: Either you loved the simple, item-hunting missions, or you thought they were dull and repetitive. Little room was left for any middle ground. This same “take it or leave it” design had been at the center of the TJ&E experience since the beginning, and that game’s classic status (check out those prices on eBay!) pretty much closes the book on whether it works or not. The case may be made that Mission to Earth borrowed a bit too heavily from its source material, but it cannot be denied that the basic grab-and-go gameplay makes it a great game to play in spurts and with a pal.Perhaps the only real downside to finally getting a new ToeJam & Earl game was the late hour at which it came. By 2002, some younger gamers, unaware of the series’ roots, dismissed the Xbox entry as dated, but those familiar with the franchise were happy to have Mission to Earth and appreciated the return to the original gameplay style. the inclusion of downloadable content was a welcome bonus.With the success of the rapping duo’s most recent outing, things look pretty bright for the ToeJam & Earl. Johnson has said that he would like to continue the franchise, though nothing is currently in the works. With the advent of another generation of consoles, and the establishment of the Xbox as a viable brand for the future, I sincerely doubt that things will end at a trilogy. One can only hope so.

      "ToeJam & Earl is an action video game developed by\nJohnson Voorsanger\nProductions and published by Sega for the Mega Drive/Genesis video game console.\nReleased in 1991, it centers on the titular ToeJam and Earl—alien rappers who have crash-landed on Earth. As they attempt to escape\nthe planet, players assume the role of either character and collect\npieces of their wrecked spacecraft. ToeJam & Earl's\ndesign was heavily influenced by the computer role-playing game\nRogue, and took from it such\nfeatures as the random generation of levels and items. It\nreferences and parodies 1990s urban culture and is set to a funk soundtrack.The game was positively received by critics, who praised its\noriginality, soundtrack, humor and two-player cooperative mode. It\nattained sleeper hit\nstatus despite low initial sales, and its protagonists were used as\nmascots by Sega. ToeJam & Earl was followed by two\nsequels: ToeJam & Earl\nin Panic on Funkotron and ToeJam & Earl III:\nMission to Earth, released for the Mega Drive and Xbox, respectively. The sequels'\ncommercial and critical success was mixed. The game again received\npositive reviews in 2006 when re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console.ToeJam & Earl has been called a surreal, comic satire,[1]\nand a \"daringly misanthropic commentary on Earthly\nlife\".[2]\nThe game's protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, have been described as a\n\"three-legged red alien\" and \"fat orange alien\", respectively.[3]\nToeJam wears a large gold medallion and a backwards baseball cap,\nwhile Earl is marked by high-tops and oversized sunglasses; both\noutfits are \"over-the-top appropriations\" of 1990s urban culture.[1]\nTheir speech features California slang.[4] The\ngame is set to a soundtrack which has been described both as jazz-funk,[1]\nand as hip\nhop.[5]\nFor the game's unique sound, composer John Baker was inspired by Herbie Hancock\nand The\nHeadhunters.[1]In the game's opening sequence, ToeJam explains that Earl's\nerratic piloting abilities have resulted in a crash-landing on\nEarth. He says that they must find the pieces of their spacecraft's wreckage to\nreturn to their home planet, Funkotron.[6] The\nplayer guides the characters as they avoid Earth's antagonistic\ninhabitants and search for the debris.[1]\nShould the player succeed, the final sequence depicts ToeJam and\nEarl escaping the planet in their reconstructed spacecraft. Under\nthe player's control, the characters proceed across a purple\nlandscape that represents Funkotron, and are greeted by their\nfriends and family.[7]ToeJam & Earl takes place from a top-down\nperspective in a 2D game world. Its gameplay\nmechanics were inspired by Rogue, which has led to its\ndescription as a Roguelike or dungeon-crawl\ngame.[8][9]\nThe game contains both single-player and two-player cooperative\nmodes. The latter displays a single screen when both characters are\nnear each other, but splits it apart when they are not.[1]\nPlaying the game with two players reveals dialogue and jokes\nbetween the characters not heard in the single player game.[1][4]The game is set on Earth, which is represented by randomly\ngenerated islands that float in space,[8]\neach one a layer above the last. They are connected by elevators.\nSome islands contain pieces of spacecraft wreckage, of which the\nplayer must collect 10 to win the game.[1]\nThe player\ncharacter drops to the island below if he falls from an\nisland's edge, which necessitates that the player again locate an\nelevator.[4] Each\nisland is populated by antagonistic \"Earthlings\", such as phantom\nice-cream trucks, aggressive packs of \"nerds\", giant hamsters, Bogeymen, man-eating\nmailboxes, and police chickens.[1][10][4]\nCertain Earthlings aid the player.[1]\nThe game has been described as \"largely non-violent\",[11]\nas the protagonists can only attack enemies with thrown\ntomatoes—one of many temporary, randomly generated power-ups.[1]Power-ups are contained in wrapped presents,[8]\nwhich are categorized by appearance. The contents of a present are\ninvisible to the player until it is opened; afterwards, all\npresents of that appearance are identified. Identification of\npresents' contents is a central gameplay mechanic.[8][9]\nEach power-up has a unique effect: while one might increase the player\ncharacters' running speed, another distracts enemies.[4][8]\nCertain presents contain harmful power-ups, such the loss of a\n\"life\", or the \"randomizer\", which hides the identity of all\npresents. In the game's cooperative mode, if one player character\nopens a present in the vicinity of the other, its contents affect\nboth characters.[9]\nAs players open more presents, the chances of accidentally opening\nthe randomizer are increased, which prevents the game from becoming\neasier as more presents are identified.[9]ToeJam & Earl creator Greg Johnson became a fan of\nRogue as a university student. After he left university,\nhe worked on games for Electronic Arts, including Starflight\n(1986).[12]\nAfter the completion of Starflight 2,\nJohnson conceived ToeJam & Earl—first the characters,\nthen the plot—while on a beach in Hawaii.[13]\nThe idea was a combination of Rogue's gameplay concepts\nand a lighter version of Starflight's science-fiction\nthemes.[1][12]\nJohnson met programmer Mark Voorsanger through a mutual friend,\nwhile walking on Mount Tam in 1989. He related the concept\nof ToeJam & Earl to Voorsanger, and the two resolved\nto make the game together. They formed Johnson Voorsanger\nProductions, and serious work on the game began soon after.[12]\nTheir status as commercial game designers allowed them to meet with\nSega of America, and they used cards covered in landscape drawings\nto demonstrate their idea of randomly generated levels.[12]\nSega marketing manager Hugh Bowen was immediately interested in the\nconcept; Sega wanted innovative games and new mascots to compete\nwith Nintendo.[12][1]The game's small development team was composed of Johnson's\nprevious colleagues,[1]\nand its music was composed by John Baker. The team's goal was to\nmake a humorous game that was \"original, easy to understand and\noffered an immediate response to the player's actions\". The\ndesigners wanted to include a two-player mode so that they could\nplay together, and considered ToeJam & Earl \"a two\nplayer game with a one player option.\"[13]\nWhile Sega believed that hardware issues would prevent the feature\nfrom working, Voorsanger successfully implemented it.[12]\nIn a 1992 interview with Sega Visions, Johnson stated that the\ncharacters ToeJam and Earl evolved as reflections of his and\nVoorsanger's personalities. Voorsanger disagreed, and called the\ncharacters \"two different aspects of Greg's personality\".[13]\nSteve Purcell\nhas stated that he contributed character designs to the game.[14]ToeJam & Earl received positive reviews,[12]\nwhich Bill Paris of UGO described as \"almost unanimous critical\nacclaim\".[15]\nHowever, Sega deemed it a commercial failure due to low initial\nsales. The game built a cult following through word of mouth,[12]\nand it was further aided by the Mega Drive's Christmas 1991 sales\nspike, caused by the release of Sonic the Hedgehog.[1]\nToeJam & Earl was later considered a \"cult\"\nsuccess.[12]Mean\nMachines found the game addictive and original, but found\nfault with its slow-paced combat.[4] One\nof the reviewers said, \"Not everyone will like it—it's not normal\nenough for mass appeal—but I think it's destined to become a\nmassive cult classic\".[4]\nGamePro called the\ngame's originality \"incredible\", and praised its graphics, music\nand humor.[16]\nEntertainment Weekly praised\nthe \"absolutely hilarious\" sound effects and music.[17] Jeff\nCsatari of Boys'\nLife called it a \"another hot game\" for the Mega Drive,\nalongside Sonic the\nHedgehog.[18] Ed\nMartinez of Game\nInformer commended the game's soundtrack and unique\nconcept, but found it to be too easy.[19] A\nreview published in both the Chicago Tribune and Rome\nNews-Tribune likened ToeJam and Earl to \"an\nouter-space, rap version of Abbott and Costello\". The reviewers\ncalled it \"the funniest game we've seen in a long time\", and\npraised its soundtrack, graphics and action.[5][20]\nThe Toronto Star acclaimed the game's\n\"hilariously designed split-screen two-player mode\", and said, \"If\nyou've got a Sega-Genesis system, you simply must check out [this]\nawesome rap 'n' roll game\".[21]\nSega\nVisions praised the game's \"no-repetitive action\" and\nsaid, \"This is the zaniest game that ever rocked Sega's Genesis\nsystem.\"[22]\nSeveral months after the game's release, Mega\nranked it the 13th best Mega Drive game in its All-Time Top 100\nfeature. The magazine praised the game's \"superbly manic and zany\naction\", and deemed it both \"original and insane\".[23]ToeJam & Earl was re-released on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console in 2006.[8]\nOfficial Nintendo\nMagazine scored the game 85%, and praised its humor,\noriginality and two-player mode. However, the reviewer believed\nthat the game's enjoyability had diminished with time.[24] GameSpot felt that the game's\n1990s idioms were dated, but that the gameplay—particularly the\ntwo-player mode—was still enjoyable by modern standards.[8]\nJeremy Parish of 1UP found\nthe game's two-player co-operative mode more enjoyable than its\nsingle-player, and described the graphics and sound as \"oddly\nprimitive\". Parish considered it \"one of the best games to hit VC\nto date\".[11]\nEurogamer's reviewer\nnegatively received the game, and believed its gameplay to be\nunsatisfying and overly slow.[3]\nIGN called the game's visuals a\n\"mixed bag\" and derided the slow pace, but praised its\nunpredictability and believed that its sound design was \"one thing\nyou absolutely can't fault\".[25]ToeJam and Earl became \"one of Sega's second tier mascots,\nalongside Sonic\",[26] and\none of the Mega Drive's \"key exclusive franchises\".[27] The\ncharacters appeared in a spin-off light gun game,\nReady, Aim, Tomatoes, developed by Johnson Voorsanger\nProductions as one of six mini-games for the Menacer 6-game cartridge.[1]\nIn early 1992, the developers began work on a sequel to ToeJam\n& Earl, and spent three months expanding on the original\ngame's concept by adding indoor areas and more terrain types.[1]\nSega was not impressed by the sequel, and believed it to be\nunmarketable. The team redesigned it as a platform game, as Sega was inclined to\npublish games in this genre.[1][12]\nThe game, entitled ToeJam & Earl\nin Panic on Funkotron, was highly anticipated, and was a\ncommercial and critical success when it released in 1993. However,\nfans of the original game were disappointed by the change in design\nto a perceived generic style.[1]\nDue to poor North American sales of the Sega Saturn, Sega's next generation video\ngame console, the ToeJam & Earl franchise was\nneglected. A ToeJam & Earl game planned for the Dreamcast was cancelled,\nbut a third installment, ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to\nEarth, was released for the Xbox in 2002. The release returned\nto the concepts of the original game, but generated mixed reviews\nand poor sales.[1][12]ToeJam & Earl has been called \"weird\",[8]\n\"strange\",[4][11]\nand \"thoroughly odd\".[3]\nCritics have difficulty in determining a genre for the game;[1]\nit has been called a platform game and Roguelike,[4][9]\nas well as action and action-adventure.[8][25]\nWhile ToeJam & Earl's success did not match that of\nthe Mega Drive's other popular titles, it has been considered a\n\"classic\",[8][2]\nand a \"cult\" game.[12][15]\nPrior to ToeJam & Earl III's conception, research by\nits developers found that the original ToeJam & Earl\nwas preferred over its sequel.[1][28] In an\nIGN survey, 65% of respondents cited\nit as their favorite of the three games.[29] The\ngame was set to be re-released on Xbox Live Arcade after winning a poll\narranged by Sega,[30] but\nthis is uncertain because Greg Johnson owns the rights to the\ncharacters rather than Sega. The notion of a ToeJam &\nEarl game for the Nintendo DS failed to generate interest\nfrom publishers, but Johnson has reiterated the possibility of such\na game in the future.[31]ToeJam & Earl is the first in a series of\naction-adventure games for the Sega\nGenesis and Xbox consoles. The first game was released\non March\n12, 1991\nin North America. The games feature the two eponymous characters,\naliens from a planet called Funkotron, who accidentally crash on\nEarth after their ship collides with an asteroid.The games were created by ToeJam & Earl Productions,\nformerly known as Johnson Voorsanger Productions (JVP), of San\nRafael, California by founders Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger.\nScott Berfield was the producer and it was published by Sega of\nAmerica. The music was written by John Baker.The game's premise starts with ToeJam and Earl cruising the\nstars in their spaceship, when ToeJam decides to let Earl drive. As\na result, the pair crash-land on Earth, their spaceship broken into\nten pieces. They must search for the pieces and reassemble their\nspaceship in order to return home to the planet Funkotron. As they\ndo so, they face a variety of Earthlings that either stand in their\nway (by causing the player to lose health in various ways) or help\nby providing beneficial services (for a small fee).The gameplay consists of the player controlling the characters\naround a multitude of levels in a search for their Funkotronic\nspace ship parts, while fighting earthlings with tomatoes. During\nthe game, the player will also collect present boxes which contain\nspecial items. The items vary from food (to gain or lose health\npoints) to rocket-skate shoes, and each different type of present\nbox contains the same kind item.ToeJam & Earl/Table of ContentsThis page is a stub.

It was unique, very non-linear, and could make even the most jaded gamer at least crack a smile. Toe Jam & Earl, released in 1991, was both refreshing and highly original. The random levels ensured you never played the same game twice, and got only better when you brought a friend along. Two sequels followed, cementing the series’ place in history and making it one of the most loved Sega franchises.Toe Jam & Earl was designed by Greg Johnson, who has been involved with video games for twenty-four years. Beginning with the EA mega-hit Starflight, Johnson has steadily maintained a level of originality and ingenuity that has kept him in constant demand. He has earned numerous awards for his achievements, and he has been at the forefront of American console game design for over two decades, including a period when it seemed that only those games made in Japan were popular. If history is any indication, Johnson has proven that premise to be false.Together with Mark Voorsanger, Johnson formed Toe Jam & Earl Productions in 1989 and has released several successful products for the Genesis, PC, and Xbox. Since Toe Jam & Earl 3 for the Xbox, he has been doing design consulting work in the area of virtual characters and emotionally-based behavior modeling. He also spent seven months working at Maxis on the Sims 2, and with Will Wright on his new secret project. Johnson has a strong interest in developing games for girls and for families, and has spoken on computer game and interface design, both at the Computer Game Developer’s Conference and at Stanford University. A bio-linguistics graduate from the University of California in San Diego, Johnson also speaks Japanese and Thai almost fluently, and enjoys writing children’s stories as well as designing and playing board games.Sega-16 was fortunate to speak with Mr. Johnson about Toe Jam & Earl, as well as some of his other works.Sega-16: You and Mark Voorsanger have been friends for a long time. What exactly brought the two of you together to create games? Was Toe Jam and Earl something you came up with together?Greg Johnson: Well, no. The concept for the game came from me, or rather my subconscious. Which is not to say that Mark didn’t add a tremendous amount as we got rolling. Mark and I were introduced by another friend and we were all out for a walk on Mount Tamalpais, north of San Fran. and I said to Mark, “Hey, I have this sort of crazy idea for a game. You wanna build it with me?” and he said “Sure, why not.”Sega-16: How difficult was it to pitch the idea to Sega?Greg Johnson: Easy. Back then Sega of America was just starting out. They had only about 20 people in their office and didn’t even have any staff lawyers yet (which was maybe just as well for us). The fellow there, Hugh Bowen, was very receptive to the concept. They were really looking for new distinctive titles to help them compete against Nintendo at the time.Sega-16: The use of random levels added incredibly to the game’s replay value. Was this something you always considered doing, or was it decided later on during development?Greg Johnson: It was part of the design from the very beginning. That’s because the design of TJ&E was really based on an old favorite game of mine called Rogue. I used to stay up till 4:00 am regularly playing that on the mainframe computer at college. The random levels are really an integral part of the game, and they are part of what make the whole “try to get as far as you can” dynamic work. Each time you get a bit farther and then you have to start all over again. If the game didn’t have random levels that just wouldn’t work. That’s why I’m so bummed when I think about how I allowed outside pressures to cause me to alter the game structure in TJ&E3. Having a hub structure game made the random levels much less integral to the game, and I think it really lost some of the addictive nature of the original.Sega-16: Were there any concepts that had to be cut from the original Toe Jam & Earl?Greg Johnson: Not really. Mark and I were just two guys in an office building a game as fast as we could. We just kept adding stuff until our time and money ran out. Looking back it really does feel like the garage shop days. I think we managed to put pretty much everything we wanted to into that original game. Mark was an amazingly fast programmer and he did all of that himself. Really a one man show. I remember towards the end of development each compile would take about 45 minutes on the Genesis dev. system. That meant that Mark had to be extremely meticulous. Bug fixes were really crazy.Sega-16: Many gamers questioned the changes made to the gameplay in Panic on Funkotron. What made you decide to go in a different direction with the sequel?Greg Johnson: We actually started in on a sequel that was very similar to the first game. We got about three months into the game, and had several new features implemented like sliding on ice, and going into caves and buildings when we put on the brakes and decided to change over to a side-scroller. That’s because around that time it was becoming apparent to us that we weren’t getting much support from Sega marketing. They just didn’t get the game – it was too different from their other games. We asked them what they thought and they were enthusiastic about taking a new direction. Mark and I felt it wasn’t worth doing another game that wouldn’t get supported so we switched over. In retrospect its pretty clear that we should have stuck with plan A. I’m sure that even the folks at Sega would say that too.Sega-16: Were there ever any plans to bring the series to the Sega CD or 32X?Greg Johnson: No. TJ&E really sat dormant for awhile while Mark and I did other things. Then ten years later, we came back to it again.Sega-16: How difficult was it to revisit the series on Xbox after so many years?Greg Johnson: Well, we didn’t plan to do it for Xbox originally. It was going to be a Dreamcast game and we got close to a release version before we had to jump tracks and rebuild for the Xbox. For the DC version we had a three-player online mode working that was pretty fun, and we had to can it when we switched over. Anyway, it was great fun to get to build out the characters and the world, and to be able to do it with a talented team instead of just me and Mark. Our original plan was to stick very close to the original game format. We got a fair bit of pressure from Sega to “update” the game as they felt that was too “old school,” basically to make it more like Donkey Kong. It was a bit of a tough balancing act. It was really important to me not to lose the original spirit of the game. Also, the Xbox is a pretty hardcore audience and we needed to try and push it in a more teen direction. Ultimately, I think the Gamecube would have been the best platform choice, followed by the PS2. Oh well, live and learn.Sega-16: Will we ever see Toe Jam & Earl again?Greg Johnson: I hope so. There is a Hollywood studio which you know well who has optioned the rights. If you know Hollywood at all there’s no telling if they will ever do anything with them or not. In fact, they recently renewed their option so maybe there’s hope. If they did put a movie or show into production we might still see another game. Or maybe I’ll have a chance to do something for the handheld systems. We still get lots of requests for that through our website.Sega-16: Starflight was a huge and complex adventure for its time. What inspired you to create such a game? Were you involved with the Genesis port?Greg Johnson: Switching gears on me eh? That’s going WAY back. Again it was really in EA’s early days, when they had only about thirty people in their office and had only done a dozen games or so. Funny to think about that now. Starflight was the first big selling game on the PC…I remember people saying “no one will buy games for the PC – that’s not what it’s for.” Anyway it was my very first game, a first for all of us on the team. I didn’t really know what a game should be, and it’s amazing that we completed anything at all. I’m glad somebody remembers Starflight (and kind of amazed). And yes, I did the design for the Genesis version but then handed that off to another group to build. Right now there are two groups that I know of working on unofficial sequels to Starflight.Sega-16: Would you ever consider doing another installment of Star Control?Greg Johnson: Star Control wasn’t my game. I did help out on it, but that was really done by two good friends of mine Paul Reiche and Fred Ford. Paul and Fred run a game development studio called Toys For Bob. Back in the old days a bunch of us who developed games used to share a suite of offices, and basically just help each other out on our respective games. Paul let me write the dialogue for a number of the races in Star Control 2 and I think I did the artwork for most of the spaceships, but that’s it. It was Paul’s design. To this day Star Control Melee continues to be one of the games I play the most. I think Paul is one of the most amazing game designers ever.We would like to thank Mr. Johnson for his time.

      "ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, called ToeJam & Earl in Panic auf Funkotron in Germany, is the sequel to ToeJam & Earl, and was released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993.Unlike the original game it is a 2D sidescroller set on ToeJam and Earl's home planet, Funkotron. The story picks up after the first game, where after escaping earth the duo find a number of Earthlings have stowed away on their ship, and are now causing mayhem.Johnson Voorsanger Productions had originally planned to make the sequel to ToeJam & Earl much like its predecessor, i.e. a top-down action game as opposed to a sidescroller. Sega of America, however, felt that it would be better as a 2D platformer, so the game was entirely reworked to suit the publisher's needs.The game was eventually followed by ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth for the Xbox.n/aSteam manual#54: \"January 1994\" (199x-xx-xx)#21: \"Enero 1994\" (1994-xx-xx)#14: \"Mayo 1994\" (1994-xx-xx)Sega Retro is part of the Backwards Compatible family of sites, which are dedicated to research and preservation of gaming history and culture.Donate | Privacy Policy | About Sega Retro | ContactExcept where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.Publisher: SegaDeveloper: Johnson Voorsanger ProductionsSystem(s): Sega Mega Drive, Virtual Console, PlayStation Network, SteamSound driver: GEMSPeripherals supported: Six Button Control PadGenre: ActionNumber of players: 1-2Release \n Date \n RRP \n Code\n\n\n  US \n 1993-12[1] \n $49.99[1] \n 1043\n\n\n  UK \n 1994-01-16 \n £49.99[2] \n 1043\n\n\n  FR \n 1994-01-16 \n ?F \n 1043\n\n\n  DE \n 1994-01-16 \n DM ? \n 1043\n\n\n  ES \n 1994-01-16 \n ?Ptas \n 1043\n\n\n  AU \n 199x \n $? \n ?\n\n\n  BR \n 199x \n R$? \n ?\n\n\n  AS \n 199x \n ? \n ?\n\n\n  KR \n 199x \n ₩? \n GM93048JG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  US \n 2007-06-04[3] \n 800[3] pts \n ?\n\n\n  EU \n 2007-06-01[4] \n 800[4] pts \n ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  US \n 2012-03-14[6] \n $4.99[5] \n 71167\n\n\n  EU \n 2012-03-14[6] \n €4.49[5] \n 71167\n\n\n  UK \n 2012-03-14[6] \n £3.99[5] \n 71167\n\n\n  AU \n 2012-03-14[6] \n $6.99[5] \n 71167\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  US ▼\n\n 2012-11-06[7]\n\n $4.99[7]\n\n NPUB-30797\n\n\n\n\n  EU ▼\n\n 2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[8]\n\n €4.49[7]\n\n NPEB-01008\n\n\n\n\n  UK ▼\n\n 2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[8]\n\n £3.59[7]\n\n NPEB-01008\n\n\n\n\n  AU ▼\n\n 2012-11-06[7]\n\n $6.25[7]\n\n NPEB-01008\n\n\n\n\n  KR ▼\n\n 2012-11-07[9]\n\n ₩6,200[9]\n\n NPHB-00501\n\n\n\n\n  TW ▼\n\n 2012-11-07[10]\n\n NT$156[10]\n\n NPHB-00501US1993-12[1]$49.99[1]1043UK1994-01-16£49.99[2]1043FR1994-01-16?F1043DE1994-01-16DM ?1043ES1994-01-16?Ptas1043AU199x$??BR199xR$??AS199x??KR199x₩?GM93048JGUS2007-06-04[3]800[3] pts?EU2007-06-01[4]800[4] pts?US2012-03-14[6]$4.99[5]71167EU2012-03-14[6]€4.49[5]71167UK2012-03-14[6]£3.99[5]71167AU2012-03-14[6]$6.99[5]71167US ▼2012-11-06[7]$4.99[7]NPUB-30797EU ▼2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[8]€4.49[7]NPEB-01008UK ▼2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[8]£3.59[7]NPEB-01008AU ▼2012-11-06[7]$6.25[7]NPEB-01008KR ▼2012-11-07[9]₩6,200[9]NPHB-00501TW ▼2012-11-07[10]NT$156[10]NPHB-00501ESRBVRCPEGIOFLCPublication\n\nScore\n\nSource\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsoles + (FR)\n\n89\n\n №28, p98/99/100\n\n\n\n\nComputer & Video Games (UK)\n\n89\n\n №146, p89[13]\n\n\n\n\nGamePro (US)\n\n95\n\n №53, p88/89[1]\n\n\n\n\nGamesMaster (UK)\n\n90\n\n №13, p68/69/70\n\n\n\n\nNo results\n\n90\n\n №54\n\n\n\n\nJoypad (FR)\n\n84\n\n №27, p110/111\n\n\n\n\nMega (UK)\n\n92\n\n №16, p58/59\n\n\n\n\nMega Action (UK)\n\n87\n\n №9, p18/19\n\n\n\n\nMegaTech (UK)\n\n91\n\n №25\n\n\n\n\nMean Machines Sega (UK)\n\n91\n\n №15, p28-32[14]\n\n\n\n\nPlayer One (FR)\n\n91\n\n №38, p84/85/86\n\n\n\n\nSega Magazine (UK)\n\n88\n\n №1, p104/105[2]\n\n\n\n\nSega Power (UK)\n\n90\n\n №50, p60/61\n\n\n\n\nSega Pro (UK)\n\n93\n\n №28, p58/59\n\n\n\n\nSega Zone (UK)\n\n92\n\n №15, p42/43/44\n\n\n\n\nSonic the Comic (UK)\n\n85\n\n №16, p11\n\n\n\n\nNo results\n\n81Consoles + (FR)89№28, p98/99/100Computer & Video Games (UK)89№146, p89[13]GamePro (US)95№53, p88/89[1]GamesMaster (UK)90№13, p68/69/70No results90№54Joypad (FR)84№27, p110/111Mega (UK)92№16, p58/59Mega Action (UK)87№9, p18/19MegaTech (UK)91№25Mean Machines Sega (UK)91№15, p28-32[14]Player One (FR)91№38, p84/85/86Sega Magazine (UK)88№1, p104/105[2]Sega Power (UK)90№50, p60/61Sega Pro (UK)93№28, p58/59Sega Zone (UK)92№15, p42/43/44Sonic the Comic (UK)85№16, p11No results81Based on17 reviewsCoverCartFile:Toejam And Earl Panic Funkotron MD US Manual.pdfManualCoverCartCoverCartCoverCartCartMain page | Comparisons | Hidden content | Magazine articles | Region codingToeJam & Earl (1991) | ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron (1993)ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth (2002)Sega Vintage Collection: ToeJam & Earl (2012)ToeJam & Earl Rap (1991) | Sega Tunes: ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron (1996)",
      "﻿ToeJam & Earl is the first in a series of action-adventure games for the Sega Genesis and Xbox consoles. The first game was released on March 12, 1991 in North America. The games feature the two eponymous characters, aliens from a planet called Funkotron, who accidentally crash on Earth after their ship collides with an asteroid.The games were created by ToeJam & Earl Productions, formerly known as Johnson Voorsanger Productions (JVP), of San Rafael, California by founders Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger. Scott Berfield was the producer and it was published by Sega of America. The music was written by John Baker.The game's premise starts with ToeJam and Earl cruising the stars in their spaceship, when ToeJam decides to let Earl drive. As a result, the pair crash-land on Earth, their spaceship broken into ten pieces. They must search for the pieces and reassemble their spaceship in order to return home to the planet Funkotron. As they do so, they face a variety of Earthlings that either stand in their way (by causing the player to lose health in various ways) or help by providing beneficial services (for a small fee).The gameplay consists of the player controlling the characters around a multitude of levels in a search for their Funkotronic space ship parts, while fighting earthlings with tomatoes. During the game, the player will also collect present boxes which contain special items. The items vary from food (to gain or lose health points) to rocket-skate shoes, and each different type of present box contains the same kind item.This page is a stub.

      "ToeJam & Earl is an action video game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis video game console. Released in 1991, it centers on the titular ToeJam and Earl—alien rappers who have crash-landed on Earth. As they attempt to escape the planet, players assume the role of either character and collect pieces of their wrecked spacecraft. ToeJam & Earl's design was heavily influenced by the role-playing video game Rogue, and took from it such features as the random generation of levels and items. It references and parodies 1980s and early 90s urban culture and is set to a funk soundtrack.The game was positively received by critics, who praised its originality, soundtrack, humor and two-player cooperative mode. It attained sleeper hit status despite low initial sales, and its protagonists were used as mascots by Sega. ToeJam & Earl was followed by two sequels: ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron and ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, released for the Sega Genesis and Xbox, respectively. The sequels' commercial and critical success was mixed. A fourth title, ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove, is currently in development with funds from Kickstarter. The game was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in December 2006 and re-released again on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in November 2012.ToeJam & Earl has been called a surreal, comic satire,[29] and a \"daringly misanthropic commentary on Earthly life\".[30] ToeJam is red and has three legs. Earl is fat and orange.[5] ToeJam wears a large gold medallion and a backwards baseball cap, while Earl is marked by high-tops and oversized sunglasses; both outfits are \"over-the-top appropriations\" of 1990s urban culture.[29] Their speech features California slang. The game is set to a soundtrack which has been described both as jazz-funk,[29] and as hip hop. For the game's unique sound, composer John Baker was inspired by Herbie Hancock and The Headhunters.[29]In the game's opening sequence, ToeJam explains that Earl's erratic piloting abilities have resulted in a crash-landing on planet Earth. He says that they must find the widely scattered pieces of their spacecraft's wreckage to return to their home planet, Funkotron. The player guides the characters as they avoid Earth's antagonistic inhabitants and search for the debris.[29] Should the player succeed, the final sequence depicts ToeJam and Earl escaping the planet in their reconstructed spacecraft. Under the player's control, the characters proceed across a purple landscape that represents Funkotron, and are greeted by their friends and family.ToeJam & Earl takes place from a 3/4 perspective in a 2D game world. Its gameplay mechanics were inspired by Rogue, which has led to its description as a Roguelike or dungeon-crawl game.[6][7] The game contains both single-player and two-player cooperative modes. The latter displays a single screen when both characters are near each other, but splits it apart when they are not.[29] Playing the game with two players reveals dialogue and jokes between the characters not heard in the single player game.[29]The game is set on Earth, which is represented by randomly generated islands that float in space,[6] each one a layer above the last. They are connected by elevators. Some islands contain pieces of spacecraft wreckage, of which the player must collect 10 to win the game.[29] The player character drops to the island below if he falls from an island's edge, which necessitates that the player again locate an elevator. Each island is populated by antagonistic \"Earthlings\", such as phantom ice-cream trucks, aggressive packs of \"nerds\", giant hamsters, Bogeymen, man-eating mailboxes, and chickens armed with mortars that shoot tomatoes.[29][31] Certain Earthlings aid the player.[29] The game has been described as \"largely non-violent\",[32] as the protagonists can only attack enemies with thrown tomatoes—one of many temporary, randomly generated power-ups.[29]Power-ups are contained in wrapped presents,[6] which are categorized by appearance. The contents of a present are unknown to the player until it is opened; afterwards, all presents of that appearance are identified. Presents with question marks can hold any item at random, so their contents cannot be identified on sight alone. Identification of presents' contents is a central gameplay mechanic.[6][7] Each power-up has a unique effect: while one might increase the player characters' running speed, another distracts enemies.[6] Certain presents contain harmful power-ups, such the loss of a \"life\", or the \"Randomizer\", which resets the identity of all presents. In the game's cooperative mode, if one player character opens a present in the vicinity of the other, its contents affect both characters.[7] As players open more presents, the chances of accidentally opening the Randomizer are increased, which prevents the game from becoming easier as more presents are identified.[7]ToeJam & Earl creator Greg Johnson became a fan of Rogue as a university student. After he left university, he worked on games for Electronic Arts, including Starflight (1986).[10] After the completion of Starflight 2, Johnson conceived ToeJam & Earl—first the characters, then the plot—while on a beach in Hawaii. The idea was a combination of Rogue's gameplay concepts and a lighter version of Starflight's science-fiction themes.[29][10] Johnson met programmer Mark Voorsanger through a mutual friend, while walking on Mount Tam in 1989. He related the concept of ToeJam & Earl to Voorsanger, and the two resolved to make the game together. They formed Johnson Voorsanger Productions, and serious work on the game began soon after.[10] Their status as commercial game designers allowed them to meet with Sega of America, and they used cards covered in landscape drawings to demonstrate their idea of randomly generated levels.[10] Sega marketing manager Hugh Bowen was immediately interested in the concept and he enlisted the aid of producer Scott Berfield to sell the game to management; Sega wanted innovative games and new mascots to compete with Nintendo.[29][10]The game's small development team was composed of Johnson's previous colleagues,[29] and its music was composed by John Baker. The team's goal was to make a humorous game that was \"original, easy to understand and offered an immediate response to the player's actions\". The designers wanted to include a two-player mode so that they could play together, and considered ToeJam & Earl \"a two player game with a one player option.\" While Sega believed that hardware issues would prevent the feature from working, Voorsanger successfully implemented it.[10] In a 1992 interview with Sega Visions, Johnson stated that the characters ToeJam and Earl evolved as reflections of his and Voorsanger's personalities. Voorsanger disagreed, and called the characters \"two different aspects of Greg's personality\". Steve Purcell has stated that he contributed character designs to the game.[11]ToeJam & Earl received positive reviews,[10] which Bill Paris of UGO described as \"almost unanimous critical acclaim\".[33] However, Sega deemed it a commercial failure due to low initial sales. The game built a cult following through word of mouth,[10] and it was further aided by the Sega Genesis's Christmas 1991 sales spike, caused by the release of Sonic the Hedgehog.[29] ToeJam & Earl was later considered a \"cult\" success.[10]Mean Machines found the game addictive and original, but found fault with its slow-paced combat. One of the reviewers said, \"Not everyone will like it—it's not normal enough for mass appeal—but I think it's destined to become a massive cult classic\". GamePro called the game's originality \"incredible\", and praised its graphics, music and humor. MegaTech praised the graphics, and the 2-player option, and said the game was \"great fun - pure and simple\".Mega said that it was \"An OK game, but one which becomes completely essential when played with someone else. Got any friends? Buy this. Haven't got any friends? Buy this and make some\". The game also appeared at number 26 on its list of the best games of all time. Entertainment Weekly praised the \"absolutely hilarious\" sound effects and music.[13] Jeff Csatari of Boys' Life called it \"another hot game\" for the Sega Genesis, alongside Sonic the Hedgehog. Ed Martinez of Game Informer commended the game's soundtrack and unique concept, but found it to be too easy.A review published in both the Chicago Tribune and Rome News-Tribune likened ToeJam and Earl to \"an outer-space, rap version of Abbott and Costello\". The reviewers called it \"the funniest game we've seen in a long time\", and praised its soundtrack, graphics and action.The Toronto Star acclaimed the game's \"hilariously designed split-screen two-player mode\", and said, \"If you've got a Sega-Genesis system, you simply must check out [this] awesome rap 'n' roll game\". Sega Visions praised the game's \"no-repetitive action\" and said, \"This is the zaniest game that ever rocked Sega's Genesis system.\" Several months after the game's release, Mega ranked it the 13th best Sega Genesis game in its All-Time Top 100 feature. The magazine praised the game's \"superbly manic and zany action\", and deemed it both \"original and insane\". The Channel 4 video game programme GamesMaster gave the game a 70% rating.ToeJam & Earl was re-released on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console in 2006.[6] Official Nintendo Magazine scored the game 85%, and praised its humor, originality and two-player mode. However, the reviewer believed that the game's enjoyability had diminished with time. GameSpot felt that the game's 1990s idioms were dated, but that the gameplay—particularly the two-player mode—was still enjoyable by modern standards.[6] Jeremy Parish of 1UP found the game's two-player co-operative mode more enjoyable than its single-player, and described the graphics and sound as \"oddly primitive\". Parish considered it \"one of the best games to hit VC to date\".[32] Eurogamer's reviewer negatively received the game, and believed its gameplay to be unsatisfying and overly slow.[5] IGN called the game's visuals a \"mixed bag\" and derided the slow pace, but praised its unpredictability and believed that its sound design was \"one thing you absolutely can't fault\".[14]ToeJam and Earl became \"one of Sega's second tier mascots, alongside Sonic\",[15] and one of the Sega Genesis's \"key exclusive franchises\".[16] The characters appeared in a spin-off light gun game, Ready, Aim, Tomatoes, developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions as one of six mini-games for the Menacer 6-game cartridge.[29] In early 1992, the developers began work on a sequel to ToeJam & Earl, and spent three months expanding on the original game's concept by adding indoor areas and more terrain types.[29] Sega was not impressed by the sequel, and believed it to be unmarketable. The team redesigned it as a platform game, as Sega was inclined to publish games in this genre.[29][10] The game, titled ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, was highly anticipated, and was a commercial and critical success when it released in 1993. However, fans of the original game were disappointed by the change in design to a perceived generic style.[29] Due to poor North American sales of the Sega Saturn, Sega's next generation video game console, the ToeJam & Earl franchise was neglected. A ToeJam & Earl game planned for the Dreamcast was cancelled (a beta of the game was preserved, and on Christmas Day 2013 released on the internet by enthusiasts), but a third installment, ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, was released for the Xbox in 2002. The release returned to the concepts of the original game, but generated mixed reviews and poor sales.[29][10] A new ToeJam & Earl game is currently in development by HumaNature Studios.[17]ToeJam & Earl has been called \"weird\",[6] \"strange\",[32] and \"thoroughly odd\".[5] Critics have difficulty in determining a genre for the game;[29] it has been called a platform game and Roguelike,[7] as well as action and action-adventure.[6][14] While ToeJam & Earl's success did not match that of the Sega Genesis's other popular titles, it has been considered a \"classic\",[30][6] and a \"cult\" game.[10][33] Prior to ToeJam & Earl III's conception, research by its developers found that the original ToeJam & Earl was preferred over its sequel.[29][18] In an IGN survey, 65% of respondents cited it as their favorite of the three games.[19] The game was set to be re-released on Xbox Live Arcade after winning a poll arranged by Sega,[20] but this became uncertain because Johnson owns the rights to the characters rather than Sega. The game, along with its sequel, was announced as part of Sega Vintage Collection series for release on November 7, 2012, to be released individually on PlayStation Network and as a collection on Xbox Live Arcade.[21] The notion of a ToeJam & Earl game for the Nintendo DS failed to generate interest from publishers, but Johnson has reiterated the possibility of such a game in the future.[22] Greg Johnson would later be able to give Toejam and Earl a comeback with a new game called Toejam & Earl: Back in the Groove, which was made by his own independent game developing company HumaNature Studios, and was also made possible by Kickstarter fundraising. Greg Johnson said he was able to make a new ToeJam and Earl game without needing a publisher, since the popularity of downloadable independent games, but Adult Swim Games came to publish the game as well as for retail copies.[7][34]Johnson Voorsanger ProductionsSegaScott BerfieldGreg JohnsonMark VoorsangerJohn BakerSega GenesisNA: October 1991EU: 1991Action, dungeon crawler, roguelikeSingle-player, multiplayer",
      "If you mention the Genesis to anybody who’s familiar with it, odds are the first thing people are going to think of is Sonic. That’s understandable, of course, but Sonic’s far, far from the only mascot that Sega’s had over the years. Take a look at poor Alex Kidd, for example. If there’s one franchise that’s endured through the love of its fans, though, it’s ToeJam & Earl. Sure, it might not have the spin-offs or the fancy ports of Sonic the Hedgehog, but in a time before the blue hedgehog, it was probably one of the most radical games you’d find on the Genesis.Greg Johnson, one of the designers behind the classic space sims Starflight and Star Control, and Mark Voorsanger, one of the designers behind Night Trap, among other things, went to work on 1991 designing characters and concepts for a game influenced by games like Rogue and Nethack. The two were both heavily influenced by games such as Rogue and Nethack. While their game would keep the random nature, it would also move beyond the simple text graphics and the methodical, turn-based nature of the genre. Forming a company called, simply enough, Johnson Voorsanger Productions, the two went on to create their first game all by themselves. Sega published the game, their American branch making plans to make the alien duo their official mascots. Of course, that whole Sonic thing stopped those plans, but Johnson and Voorsanger went on to create a few more games, including the children’s art program Orly’s Draw-A-Story. Unforunately, after the third T&E title, the creators disbanded, with Greg Johnson going on to form his own development studio, HumaNature Studios, who have currently not released any games.ToeJam & Earl are two peaceful, hip-hop loving aliens from the planet Funkotron. ToeJam’s the red, three-legged red alien, while Earl’s the big orange guy in the polka-dot shorts. While cruising out one day in their spaceship, the Righteous Rapmaster Rocketship, Earl ends up taking the wheel. And then proceeds to promptly crashland on. Given that Earth is full of quicksand, gaping pits, and people who want them dead, ToeJam & Earl’s goal is to escape from Earth as soon as possible. The problem is that their rocketship ended up breaking into ten pieces on impact, and the only way off the planet is through finding them all. When you start up a game, you can either play as ToeJam, Earl, or both at once. ToeJam has an advantage in speed, although he’s lacking in health. Earl, on the other hand, has more maximum health, but he’s slower than ToeJam.Whatever you decide, your ultimate goal is to find the ten scattered rocketship pieces scattered across the 25 “floors” of the planet. Once you’ve find all ten, that’s it, you’ve won. While the game won’t tell you where they are, it will let you know if there’s one on your current level, which helps cut down on your wandering. There can be times, however, when the game will make you play through several floors before it’ll even give you one rocket piece, which can be a pain. You’ve also got a map you can bring up whenever, which will show you where you have and haven’t been yet. Once you’re ready to leave a floor, just look for the elevator and hop inside, while enjoying one of the funky beats it plays.While you’re collecting the rocketship pieces, however, you also have to deal with Earth’s terrain. Roads increase your speed, while quicksand will suck you into it, eventually vastly hurting your movement speed. There’s also water, which not only drains your health while you’re in it, but is more than likely full of sharks. It’s possible to swim through it to reach other areas, but you’ll probably want something to make it easier. Even more potentially dangerous than the water, however, is the gaping void that surrounds every floor above the first. While falling off the edge won’t hurt you, it will send you to the floor below you, possibly even more than one if there’s nothing below you on the next floor, as well.The landmasses themselves can be randomly generated each time you play, if you so choose, which means that you’ll be different with different level layouts every time you boot up the game. If you prefer, however, you can play with standardized levels, but that’s not nearly as fun. If you play with randomized maps, however, you do run a risk of ending up with levels that have things you need stuck in some out of the way place you’ll need special items to get to, which can be a huge pain if you don’t happen to have any.Even worse are the various Earth creatures who are out for your blood. At first, you’ll mostly have to deal with minor threats like fat devils and giant hamsters. None all the enemies are immediately harmful, either, like the hula dancers who use their feminine wiles to force you to dance in place. The further you get, however, the weirder and more dangerous the enemies get. There’s evil dentists who let off maniacal laughter every time they drill you, boogey men who turn invisible just before going in to strike, and the most dangerous of all, a fat guy on a lawnmower. The problem with the game is that since you don’t get any invincibility time, a lot of enemies can juggle you into oblivion, stealing one of your precious lives. For the most part, there’s no real way to dispatch the Earthlings, so you’ll want to keep your distance from them as much as you can.Your main defense comes in the form of presents, which work the same way that potions, scrolls, and wands would in a more traditional roguelike. Presents can do all sorts of things, like giving you sneakers that let you run at super speed, tomatoes you can toss at enemies to destroy them, a pair of wings, and all sorts of other good things. Since you can’t usually see what’s in them before using them, however, it’s just as likely you’ll get something terrible. You could get a rain cloud that follows you around and zaps you, a school book that makes you fall asleep right where you’re standing, or even a present that just kills you instantly. There’s also cash lying around that you can use for goods and services, as well as food, in both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ varieties.There’s also the occasional good Earthling wandering around, although these guys are sadly a lot harder to find than the bad ones. They’ll usually ask for some of your cash in exchange for a useful service, which is generally worth it. Wizards will heal you, the guy in the carrot suit (He has his reasons, apparently) will identify your presents, and the fat opera lady will serve as a bodyguard for you. You can also use your cash on mailboxes to have presents delivered straight to you. That is, if it isn’t actually a horrible monster that’ll come alive and murder you. This game is not a game that wants you to succeed.If this is all starting to sound like Nethack by way of Earthworm Jim, that’s not really a bad comparison. There’s not nearly as much combat as most roguelikes, since the tomato power-ups aren’t all that common, and the focus is more on exploration. However, you’re still wandering around a randomly generated environment, and picking up and using different items to see what they do. There’s even an experience system, where get points every time you explore one “square” of the map or open a present. Every time you hit a certain score, you rank up, lengthening your health bar and possibly earning yourself an extra life. Your rank on the status bar will increase, too, starting from “Weiner”, before moving to “Poindexter” and “Dude”, before finally hitting the prestigious rank of “Funklord”. There is also perma-death, in a sense, since there’s no way to save the game, and no continues if you run out of lives.While it’s perfectly possible to play the game by yourself, the co-op mode is where the game really shines. ToeJam & Earl are free to split apart and do their own thing, and if they get too far away from each other, the game will go into a split-screen view, coming back together if they meet up again. If they walk into each other, they’ll high-five and trade some health, and if a player ends up running out of lives, their ghost can ask to borrow a life from the other player to come back into the game. There’s also a few other benefits to the co-op as well, like listening to ToeJam & Earl’s silly conversations while they’re sharing an elevator.The actual game is full of this kind of zaniness throughout, and everything mentioned before is hardly covering it. The sense of humor is almost something like Earthworm Jim in nature, where the game will throw so much goofy stuff at you that the evil dentists start to look ordinary. All the characters look appropriately goofy, and even the lowliest of enemies have some nice touches of personality to them, like the way they’ll fall asleep when nobody’s around. The odd sense of humor is helped by all the digitized sound effects they’ve thrown in, like the way characters yell out “MONEY!” every time they pick up cash. If you’re into the hip hop that plays throughout the game, you can also mess around in the game’s “Jam Out” mode, which basically functions as the sound test.There are a few things that make the game less enjoyable, however. For one thing, the game can drag on a while, and it doesn’t help that for the most part, you’ll be looking at nothing but a lot of green, some blue, and the occasional field of quicksand. Since there’s no way to save your game, you’re never allowed to take a break, either, unless you happen to be using an emulator. Not that you’re likely to finish the game your first time through, given the difficulty curve. Given how rough the enemies get, you’re likely to end up losing your lives faster than you can actually gain them. If you manage to preserve and find all ten parts, however, you get to wander around the surface of Funkotron and talk to the inhabitants, which is a pretty cool reward.Overall, ToeJam & Earl is probably one of the most creative games on the Genesis, on a system where the only real competition is Fatal Labyrinth. It’s not only a much less cynical game, (We’re talking a game where your gold determines what kind of funeral you get) but a much more fun one as well. The more action oriented style of gameplay makes it stand out, as well as the innovative co-op mode. It could have really used a save game feature, but if you can handle the slog, it’s definitely a game to seek out on one of its several ports.Sega remembered the game enough to make a port for the “Sega Vintage Collection”. This is mostly a straight port of the original game, which a few extras added on to it. The biggest draw would have to be the online co-op, although you’ve also got now standard features like leaderboards and achievements, along with replays and save states. The graphics don’t seem to have any sort of filter put over them, which means that the screen sides are taken up by borders while you play. The version you can get on Steam, sadly, is lacking all of those features, so it’s not much more than an emulator with a ROM.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});About HG101Submission GuidelinesWanted Game ArticlesContact"

    "title": "Diablo",
    "text": [
      "Diablo  is an action role-playing hack and slash video game developed by Blizzard North and released by Blizzard Entertainment on December 31, 1996.Set in the fictional Kingdom of Khanduras, located in the mortal realm, Diablo has the player take control of a lone hero battling to rid the world of Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Beneath the town of Tristram, the player journeys through sixteen randomly generated dungeon levels, ultimately entering Hell itself in order to face Diablo.\nAn expansion pack, entitled Diablo: Hellfire, was released in 1997 by Sierra Entertainment. In 1998, Electronic Arts released Diablo for the PlayStation. This version featured direct control of the main character using the PlayStation controller and was developed by Climax Studios. A Sega Saturn version was also considered by Electronic Arts but never released. The game's success led to two sequels, Diablo II in 2000, and Diablo III in 2012. To celebrate Diablo's 20th anniversary, a quest entitled \"The Darkening of Tristram\", was added in Diablo III in early 2017.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDiablo is an action role-playing hack and slash video game. The player moves and interacts with the environment primarily by way of a mouse. Other actions, such as casting a spell, are performed in response to keyboard inputs. The player can acquire items, learn spells, defeat enemies, and interact with non-player characters (NPC)s throughout the game.\nThe dungeon levels are randomly generated, although they follow parameters according to their type; for instance the catacombs tend to have long corridors and closed rooms, while the caves are more non-linear. The players are assigned a random number of quests from several tiers; these quests are optional but help to level up the character and/or reveal more of the backstory. The final two quests, however, are mandatory in order to finish the game.\n\n\n=== Classes ===\n\nDiablo has three character classes: the Warrior, the Rogue, and the Sorcerer. Each class has a different level of assigned attributes along with a unique skill. Each class is capable of using almost all of the same items and spells, in contrast to later titles in the Diablo series which have class-specific items and spells. However, the limitations in the attributes for each class reward play that utilizes them efficiently; for instance the Warrior's low maximum level of Magic prevents him from learning the higher levels of powerful spells like the Sorcerer, instead the Warrior is best suited to melee with a faster weapon swing plus a \"critical strike\" for bonus damage.\n\nWarrior: The most physically able of the three classes. The Warrior is a close-quarters fighter and can generally take the most physical punishment. The Warrior's primary character attribute is Strength. The Warrior starts with the skill to repair objects in his possession at the cost of overall durability.\nRogue: A master of ranged weapons. While not as strong as the Warrior, the rogue is very effective at attacking enemies from a distance with the bow. The Rogue's primary character attribute is Dexterity. The Rogue's unique starting skill is the ability to disarm traps.\nSorcerer: A spellcaster being the most physically weak of the three classes, but can learn the most spells at the highest levels. The Sorcerer's primary character attribute is Magic. The Sorcerer's unique starting skill is the ability to recharge spell staves at the cost of lowering the maximum number of spell charges that the staff can hold.In the expansion set, Diablo: Hellfire, the Monk was added. The Monk was meant to be proficient at melee combat with the staff, and is not related to the Monk class in Diablo III. Two other classes, the Bard and Barbarian, were unfinished but remained hidden characters in Diablo: Hellfire, and could be enabled using a hack. Using the in-game sprites of the Rogue and Warrior, respectively, the Bard is capable of dual-wielding weapons while the Barbarian was a two-handed axe specialist.\n\n\n=== Items ===\nMany items have attribute minimums to be used effectively. White-colored items are normal items, blue-colored items are magic items and gold-colored items are unique items. Any items that are not white in color must be identified to make use of their magical effects, however, characters can use unidentified items as they would the base item. Items wear down through use and only have a certain amount of durability. When an item's durability is zero, it is destroyed. Players can return to the town and pay a fee to an NPC, Griswold the Blacksmith, to have the items restored, while the Warrior can repair objects in his possession at the cost of overall durability.Bows are the ranged weapon of the game, best used by rogues. Staves, while capable of physical attacks, are mainly used for the spell charges that they contain, as casting from a staff does not require the player to learn the spell or use mana. A staff's spell can only be cast a certain number of times before it requires a recharge. Swords are typically one-handed (though two-handed varieties also exist), while axes are all two-handed. Maces and clubs add a 50% damage bonus against the undead. Shields, when paired with single-handed weapons, allow attacks to be blocked. There are three classifications of armor: light, medium and heavy. Characters are also allowed to wear a helmet, two rings, and one amulet.Books contain spell formulas. Spell books cannot be used more than once, but multiple books of the same spell will increase the spell level, up to a maximum of 15. Scrolls allow use of both spells not yet learned, and spells not available in book form. They vanish after one use. Many potions are available for use, including health and mana restoration, and elixirs that increase statistics.\n\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nMultiplayer can be done with up to four players. Multiplayer characters' states are saved periodically. Players can either be aggressive towards, or play co-operatively with, other players. Players can connect by one of the following: direct connection, modem connection, Battle.net connection or IPX network connection. The game lacks the stronger anti-cheating methods of Blizzard's later games and as a result, many characters online have been altered in various ways by common third-party programs known as trainers and/or game editing programs such as Cheat Engine.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe setting of Diablo includes the mortal realm which is the world of Man as well as the High Heavens and the Burning Hells.:61, 62, 64 & 72 After eons of war between angels and demons, the ascension of man prompted the three Lords of Hell (including Diablo himself) to seek victory through influence, prompting their exile into the mortal realm. There, they sowed chaos, distrust, and hatred among the humans of Sanctuary until a group of magi, called the Horadrim, trapped them in enchanted crystals called \"Soulstones\". Diablo's soulstone was buried deep in the earth and a monastery was built over the site.\nGenerations passed and the purpose of the monastery was forgotten. A small town named Tristram sprang up next to the monastery's ruins. When King Leoric rebuilt the monastery as a cathedral, Diablo manipulated its archbishop, Lazarus, to destroy his soulstone prison. Diablo subsequently possessed the king, sending out his knights and priests to battle against peaceful kingdoms, and then possessed the king's son, Prince Albrecht, filling the caves and catacombs beneath the cathedral with creatures formed from the young boy's nightmares.\nTristram became a town of fear and horror, where people were abducted in the night. With no king, no law, and no army left to defend them, many villagers fled.\n\n\n=== Story ===\nThe game starts when the player's character arrives in Tristram. Several of the remaining townsfolk assist the player such as Deckard Cain the Elder. The labyrinth under the Cathedral descends from the dungeon/church, to the catacombs, followed by the caves, and finally Hell itself, each with a mixture of the undead, animals, and demons. Leoric has been re-animated as the Skeleton King.\nLate in the game, the hero must fight Archbishop Lazarus, and eventually Diablo himself. At the end of the game, the hero kills Diablo's mortal form. The hero then takes the Soulstone out of Diablo's forehead after which Diablo transforms into a lifeless Prince Albrecht. The hero then drives the Soulstone into his/her own forehead, and he or she contains the essence of Diablo within himself or herself.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nDiablo was conceived by David Brevik during the development of the fighting game Justice League Task Force (1995), developed by Japanese studio Sunsoft with two American studios, Condor Games (later Blizzard North) on the Sega Genesis version and Silicon & Synapse (soon renamed Blizzard Entertainment) on the SNES version. Condor, Brevik's studio, was initially unaware of the SNES version, but eventually became acquainted with that version's co-developer Blizzard, who they found to have a similar interest in PC gaming. Condor's proposal for Diablo, then a turn-based role-playing video game, was turned down by other publishers on the grounds that \"RPGs are dead\" before Blizzard took an interest after pitching the idea to them in January 1995. Blizzard, coming off the success of real-time strategy Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (1994), requested two major changes, to make it real-time and to have multiplayer. Brevik also designed a \"modern and cool\" interface intended to bring the quick directness of console games as well as Doom (1993) to computer RPGs. During development, Condor was eventually renamed Blizzard North. The basis of Diablo was the 1980s roguelike game Moria; Bill Roper later said that the team's \"initial pitch, in a nutshell, was to take the excitement and randomness of games like Moria, Nethack, and Rogue, and bring them into the 1990s with fantastic graphics and sound\". The switch from turn-based to real-time gameplay occurred roughly six months into production.According to Matt Barton, the game Telengard, released by Avalon Hill in 1982, influenced the development of Diablo. Barton and Bill Loguidice also cite The Legend of Zelda series as an influence on Diablo, particularly its move towards real-time action, away from the stat-heavy, turn-based gameplay of earlier computer RPGs.At first, Diablo was a turn-based role-playing game, but later in development, also influenced by the previous success of Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, they decided to make it a real-time action game. The game was also originally conceived to be made in claymation (much like ClayFighter), but they decided to have a 3D isometric style instead.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe music of Diablo was composed by Matt Uelmen. The soundtrack consists of six tracks. It was released after 15 years, in 2011.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nDiablo normally requires the original CD to play, however also included on the disk is a shareware version of the software that could be played without the CD called Diablo Spawn. This version of the game allows access to the first two areas of the dungeon, and locks out two of the three playable classes and many of the NPC townsfolk. It is playable in both single- and multi-player with those restrictions. The demo is also downloadable.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Sales ===\nAccording to Max Schaefer, Blizzard's initial sales estimates for Diablo were modest. He remarked, \"We were thinking that if everything went well, we would sell 100,000 copies.\" Following the game's positive press coverage before its release, estimates by the team were increased to roughly 500,000 copies, David Brevik later said. Pre-orders had surpassed 450,000 units globally by December 17, at which point the game was set to launch with a shipment of 500,000 units staggered across its initial days on shelves. Diablo debuted at #1 on PC Data's monthly computer game sales chart for January 1997. It held the position for another three months, before being displaced to #2 by X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter in May. Diablo remained in second place until September, when it dropped to fifth. It exited the top 10 that October.In the United States, the game was the highest-selling computer title of the first six months of 1997. Its worldwide sales surpassed 500,000 units by April, 750,000 by June and 1 million by late November. By the end of 1997, Diablo had sold 670,155 copies in the United States alone. It was declared the country's fourth-best-selling computer game of the year by PC Data. Schaefer attributed the game's success in part to its December 27 shipment date, and noted that \"there weren't any other games released after Christmas, so we were the only game in town for a long time.\"After being absent from PC Data's charts during the final months of 1997, Diablo took 13th place in the rankings for February 1998. It remained in the top 20 for another month, dropped out in April and reappeared in June. It returned to the top 10 from July through October, rising to #3 in August. For the first half of 1998, it was the United States' 14th-best-selling computer release. At the time, Jason Ocampo of Computer Games Strategy Plus called Diablo one of the charts' \" 'perennial' inhabitants\", and compared its longevity to that of Myst and NASCAR Racing 2. The game's average sale price during the January–June period was $36; by October, it had fallen to $26. Diablo finished 11th for the year in the United States, with sales of 354,961 units and revenues of $9.57 million in the region.Diablo's global sales reached almost 2 million units by September 1998. One year later, its sales in the United States alone had grown to 1.17 million copies, which made it the country's seventh-highest computer game seller since January 1993. This number rose to 1.3 million copies by March 2000. Remarking upon these sales, GameSpot's writer Desslock hailed Diablo as an \"undisputed commercial blockbuster\". The game returned in 2000 to PC Data's annual top 20 for the United States, with 260,020 copies sold.Worldwide, Diablo broke 2 million sales by mid-2000 and reached 2.3 million by January of the next year. Ultimately, the game sold over 2.5 million units by mid-2001.\n\n\n=== Critical reviews ===\nDiablo has received critical acclaim, with an average rating of 94 on Metacritic. Most praised the game's addictive gameplay, randomly generated dungeons, superior graphics, moody musical score, and great variety of possible magic items, enemies, levels, and quests. This last aspect was noted by GameSpot editor Trent Ward in his review: \"Similarly, although a set number of monsters is included, only a few will be seen during each full game. This means that players going back for their second or third shot at the game will very likely fight opponents they haven't seen before. Talk about replay value.\"Reviewers commonly cited the online multiplayer aspect as one of the strongest points of the game, with it being described as greatly extending its replay value. Computer Games Magazine's Cindy Yans said that \"weapons, armor and items are so numerous that you're always acquiring something new to try... not to mention the game's multiplayer universe\"; she went on to say that \"for anyone who enjoys a good multiplayer dungeon crawl, Diablo can't be beat\". Yans finished her review, \"Despite the rather pale storyline, [...] watered-down quests and a fair amount of necessary repetition, Diablo is a must for anyone interested in 'just plain fun.'\" Ward stated: \"Diablo is the best game to come out in the past year, and you should own a copy. Period.\"Macworld's Michael Gowan wrote, \"The only downside to this role-playing game is that the adventure ends too soon.\" Steve Klett's review for PC Games, which was reprinted in sister magazine GamePro, commented that \"Diablo's definitely not your typical dungeon hackfest. ... In fact, its closest rivals are games like Gauntlet and Loaded on the PlayStation, but they really don't compare.\" A Next Generation critic similarly remarked that Diablo is more of a modern incarnation of Gauntlet than an RPG, \"but with enough changes and improvements to make it a completely new experience, and one of the best titles so far this year.\"Diablo won the overall \"Game of the Year\" awards of Computer Gaming World, GameSpot and Computer Game Entertainment for 1996, and was a runner-up for Computer Games Strategy Plus's award in this category. The editors of Computer Gaming World wrote, \"For this year, Diablo is the game that everyone will remember.\" It was also named 1996's best computer role-playing game by GameSpot, Computer Game Entertainment and Computer Games. While it was nominated for Computer Gaming World's \"Role-Playing Game of the Year\" award, the publication gave the honor to The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2005 GameSpot chose Diablo as one of \"The Greatest Games of All Time\". It was placed at No. 20 on Game Informer's \"Top 100 RPGs Of All Time\" list.The official expansion pack made for Diablo was Diablo: Hellfire in 1997. The expansion was produced by Sierra Entertainment rather than an in-house Blizzard North development team. The multiplayer feature of the expansion pack was disabled with version 1.01. The added content included two additional dungeon segments located within a new side storyline, several unique items and magical item properties, spells, and a fourth class, the Monk. There are also two unfinished \"test\" classes (the Bard and Barbarian) and two quests which could be accessed only through a configuration file modification.\nBlizzard sold exclusive worldwide rights to develop, publish, and distribute console versions of the game to Electronic Arts in 1996. In 1998, a PlayStation version of Diablo was released, developed by Climax Studios and published by Electronic Arts. The game lacked online play, but featured a two-player cooperative mode. Notable differences to the PC version include the auto-aiming for range weapons and spells and an option for increased game speed. It features an option to learn the story through a narrator without having to find the books in the game. The European PAL version is fully translated and dubbed into French, German and Swedish in addition to the original English. The PlayStation version was infamous because of its need for 10 blocks on a PlayStation memory card; the standard size of memory cards for the platform was 15 blocks.\nThe game was re-released alongside Hellfire in a 1998 bundle, called Diablo + Hellfire. 1998's Blizzard's Game of the Year Collection contained copies of Diablo, StarCraft and Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness. The Blizzard Anthology (2000) contained Diablo, StarCraft, StarCraft: Brood War and WarCraft II: Battle.net Edition. The Diablo Gift Pack (2000) contained Diablo and Diablo II, but no expansions. The Diablo: Battle Chest (2001) contained Diablo, Diablo II and Diablo II's expansion, Lord of Destruction. Later releases of the Diablo: Battle Chest also have a strategy guide for Diablo II and Lord of Destruction, though subsequent releases do not include the original game, instead featuring Diablo II, its expansion, and their respective strategy guides.\nFor Diablo's 20th anniversary, it was announced during BlizzCon 2016 that Diablo III would receive a free patch called The Darkening of Tristram that recreates the original game. The patch contains a 16-level dungeon, four main bosses from the 1996 version and special graphics filters and 8-directions limited movement like the original game. The test patch was released on November 11, 2016 on the Public Test Realm server.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
      "﻿Comments are closed.More interesting tidbits from David Craddock’s upcoming book on Blizzard North today, courtesy of ShackNews and Fmulder, who started a good lore/story debate with his forum post.The article on ShackNews covers the creation of the Blizzard cinematic department, and early ideas for an always-online requirement for a very un-warcraft-like War3. Here’s a quote about the cinematic stuff and the story surprise they created for Blizzard North in Diablo I.The devs have covered it many times in the past, but no, there really wasn’t much story for Diablo I until well-into the project. I’ve talked to Max Schaefer, Erich Schaefer, and Dave Brevik about that, and how great the Diablo I manual was, and they all laugh and say how they were just making a cool gothic dungeon crawler and that it literally had no story throughout most of the development. That’s why all the story is in the manual, or told by those lore tomes you find in the dungeons, and how the actual game events and quests have virtually no story tied to them.The devs knew the kind of game and the mood and theme they wanted to make, but “why” of anything, and the ultimate objectives of the plot evolved over time, and were largely fleshed out by Metzen and others who weren’t part of the core game-creation group.Much the same thing happened in Diablo II, in terms of the cinematic team going off on the story and creating a lot of headaches for the game developers, as the cinematics were done (or at least finalized for content since the art/rendering took forever) well in advance of the game, and thus the story as related in the game, mostly through long speeches by Tyrael and other NPCs, had to be massaged to match up to the story as it was being told in the cinematics.The messy way the story was created always comes to my mind when players complain about the story of Diablo III, given that the current game had probably 1000% more resources and effort spent on the creation and presentation of the story than the story in D1 or D2 did. It’s definitely easier to present a good story when you’re mostly presenting ideas and archetypal events and characters, rather than trying to fit new events into a complicated timeline, and make them match a bunch of background details and past history that fans are already wedded to.I first played both D1 and D2 a few years ago and while I obviously thought they were fantastic, I’m not as attached to them as many here. 🙂  The story in the cinematics of D2 seemed to have minimal relationship to the rest of the game to me, and I was never clear on how the hero in D1 came to the bizarre conclusion that stabbing himself with Diablo was somehow a good idea.Apparently there’s a reason for that. 🙂Well, in stories and games you need the heroes to do something stupid, or else there won’t be any sequels.I think the idea was that unless a strong soul imposed their will on the stone, Diablo would “leak out” and start to corrupt the surrounding area.Containing diablo this way was never the ultimate solution, just the lesser of two evils at the time (pun intended).Yes, and it was somewhat retconned by D2 and D3 even more that that was Diablo’s plan (or at least his backup plan) all along. He tried to get Leoric but that failed, so went after his son with the understanding that great heroes would come to slay him and he could possess them instead.That wasn’t a retcon, that was just Diablo using a Xanatos gambit.D2 has my favorite storyline by far. I guess resources aren’t everything.talent..meh, i still stand by liking the story to d3, and thought all 3 games were melded well together despite things.The interaction between Baal in disguise and Marius at the asylum will forever be my favorite cutscene in any game. The environment and the voice acting were on a level that has yet to be matched in my opinion. Tyreal getting pissed at Marius for removing the soul stone… The massacre at the tavern “East… always into the East” forever burned into my memory. Those were the times of amazing cutscenes and I really do miss those days.…. this is not news. I thought this was well established.Diablo 3’s story went to hell when the hero went from struggling against one of the lesser evils to smashing down all evils united.For what could be considered Tathamet reincarnate, super Diablo was pathetic.lol the RMAH sure makes miracles possible, doesn’t it? in Blizzard we trust*sarcasm not*Show, don’t tell, Blizzard.  Like how you used to do.It shows what a mess both stories of D1 and D2 were and how much hypocrits are now running around that the story of D3 sucks.It shows how many twists and turns Metzen had to take in the last game to even come up with at least a small portion of credibility left.D games were never about the story: it is simple smash things until they die.The faster the better.As a matter of fact if D1 or D2 would be launched today as they were launched: they would be far worse than any other game launched today.D3 made the best of it and even created a whole new genre with the RAMH: a player driven cash shop (and far better than those lame cash shops from developpers where you only can buy stuff as a player). Still making around 1.5 million gold per day. That’s 20 Euro’s a month from playing a … video game.GREAT !The more I see it: D3 stands miles above D2 already these days and patch 1.05 will even make it a small “design your own difficulty” game. Hence small portions of sandbox come to mind.D3 FOREVER. Screw the rest.This is probably the worst analysis of anything I’ve ever seen.Now I know you don’t believe in a single word you have writen in this site (ever).Cool, you play video games to make money; I play mine for fun.All this is definitely new to me.One thing I will add is that the people making the cinematics in D3 did not bother to check the pronunciation for ‘Arreat’. Ergo, they probably did not play D2.This just goes to show the disconnect between story and gameplay. The game should build UPON the underlying story, and not the other way around where the game is just an interactive story. The latter style gives us gems like Diablo 3, COD:MW1-MW7 or whatever they’re on, and just any other \\on rails\\ games. Those types of games typically don’t interest me.However, games like X-COM, Elder Scrolls, and Minecraft are great. You aren’t constantly forcefed story, and you’re allowed to explore as you wish!Back when D2 was still in developement, Blizzard’s website occasionally featured a new screenshot from one of the cinematics of the game as a background ‘splash’ image. I remember people were quite irritated by how, judging from these screenshots, D2’s story promised to turn out to be very different from D1’s. Whichg was completely logical because they saw, for the very first time, Marius, Tyrael, Mephisto, etc. without really knowing who these characters were or what they had to do with what happened in Tristram. At the same time, no sign of the Tristram villagers, the hero or Diablo.There was also a developer interview at that time (I dont’ remember if pre- or post-release) covering the topic of how the main story was very disconnected from the actual adventure the main game would present. The Blizzard representative argued that the main reason behind the different approaches to storytelling were of technical nature: They just wanted to avoid (/didn’t have the capacity/…) producing the exact same action sequence five times, once for each playable charactrer. So instead, they created a story around an individual that actually had nothing to do with the gameplay itself.The same is obviously true for D3, which features 10 playable characters, none of them in any of the *real* cinematics (not the low-budget sketchbook scenes) and, again, a tragic substitutional hero. I wouldn’t  want to swap any of D3’s glorious cinemtatics for crappy in-game cutscenes, but not seeing your heroic avatar in any of these story highlights is definitely an enormous storytelling problem. One that can be sccessfully avoided once (as D2 proves) but is ultimatly not guaranteed to be a working solution (as D3’s story proves).But they did know how to make a good Diablo game.Diablo 3 > 2 > 1.The difference is staggering both in story, engine, game play, polishment and fun600 + hours and 140 Euros later …and counting🙂Fxxk the haters 🙂 I love D3.(140 – 60) / 600 = 0.13E/hour. Well done 🙂lol! I wish that were true..Story has never been Blizzard North’s strong point but who was complaining about the story when we all were playing our little hearts out for all those items ? Noone!Flux is just pissed that people are making more money from RMAH than he does running this site.He’s pissed that the only positive(ish) thing people can say about this game is that they make a few bucks on the abomination known as the RMAH.let cain be killed by some noname monster , best decision ever made in history of diabloCopyright 2018 | Diabloii.NetInformationConnectionsSubmitAdvertising",
      "Blizzard North was a game developer studio located in San Mateo, in Northern California that created Diablo I , Diablo II and Diablo II: Lord of Destruction.Development on Diablo III was begun at Blizzard North in 2000, and continued (through many rough spots) until 2005, when Blizzard North was shut down. Diablo III's development was restarted almost from scratch at Blizzard Irvine in late 2005, by an almost entirely new development team, and it has continued from there.See the Diablo III History article and the article on Blizzard North's Diablo III for many more details.Blizzard North became part of Blizzard Entertainment after Blizzard purchased Condor Inc, the game design company created by Dave Brevik, Erich Schaefer, and Max Schaefer, the creators of Diablo I.Blizzard North produced Diablo I, Diablo II, and Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. After the release of D2X in 2001 they continued working on two unannounced projects, one of them Diablo III.Delays and problems ensued, the \"Big Four\" (Bill Roper, plus the three company founders; David Brevik, Max Schaefer, and Erich Schaefer.) left in early 2003 to form Flagship Studios, and Blizzard North ultimately closed in summer 2005, without ever announcing, much less releasing, another game.Almost all the remaining employees of Blizzard North were offered contracts at Blizzard Irvine, and while some took those jobs, most quit and looked for work at other game developers in the Bay Area.Though Blizzard has never made any official comment on the changes to the project during development, some unofficial info surfaced in 2010 and 2011. Screenshots (allegedly) from the Blizzard North version surfaced in February 2011, showing levels set in the High Heavens[1]. A couple of months later, Max Schaefer revealed in a podcast interview[2] that work was underway on Diablo III when he left the company in 2003, and that the early plans were for an MMORPG, with a setting similar to that of Diablo II (and not in the High Heavens, indicating that design came in after 2003).According to various insider accounts, virtually none of the early work completed on Diablo 3 remains in the current version, which was begun almost entirely from scratch by a new team in Irvine in 2005. Bill Roper discussed this in an interview in early 2009.

We're working on a new, unannounced Diablo project.\"The remainder of the post doesn't offer much else, although it sounds as if this new project won't dramatically deviate from the typical look of a Diablo game. \"The ideal candidate works well in an environment of peers who are passionate about working on the dark gothic world of Diablo, making great games, killing millions of monsters and getting loot,\" it states.Blizzard has not announced any new Diablo games to date, although this isn't the first job opening to suggest one might be in the works. Whether this new project is a full-on sequel like Diablo 4 or something else remains to be seen. But with little in the way of major content updates for Diablo III released in the past few years outside of the Rise of the Necromancer DLC, fans have been holding out hope that something new was in the works.There's no indication of when we'll be hearing official details about the project.

      "Blizzard Entertainment is a PC game developer and publisher. Since its release of Warcraft in 1994, it has been one of the most successful game development studios in the world. Its headquarters are based in Irvine, California. The company has a history of largely overshooting release dates. However, many Blizzard fans see this as somewhat of a blessing in disguise, as Blizzard has a reputation for producing classic games that are played for years to come.  Blizzard also has a reputation for taking fierce legal action against anyone who reverse engineers their software, copies their game concepts, or publishes third-party server software that is compatible with their games.Blizzard Entertainment was founded in February, 1991 as Silicon & Synapse by Mike Morhaime, Allen Adham and Frank Pearce. The company developed games like Rock & Roll Racing and The Lost Vikings (published by Interplay Productions). In 1994, the company briefly changed its name to Chaos Studios, before finally settling on Blizzard Entertainment after it was discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed. That same year, they were acquired by distributor Davidson & Associates for under USD$10 million. Shortly thereafter, Blizzard shipped their breakthrough hit Warcraft.Blizzard has changed hands several times since then: Davidson was acquired by a timeshare company called CUC International in 1996; CUC then merged with a hotel, real-estate, and car-rental franchiser called HFS Corporation to form Cendant Software, in 1997. In 1998 it became apparent that CUC had engaged in accounting fraud for years before the merger; Cendant's stock lost 80% of its value over the next six months in the ensuing widely discussed accounting scandal. The company sold its consumer software operations, including Blizzard, to French publisher Havas in 1998, the same year Havas was purchased by Vivendi. Blizzard is now part of the VU Games group of Vivendi Universal.In 1996, Blizzard acquired Condor Games, which had been working on the game Diablo for Blizzard at the time. Condor was renamed Blizzard North, and has since developed hit games Diablo, Diablo II, and its expansion pack Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. Blizzard North was located in San Mateo, California.Blizzard launched their online gaming service Battle.net in January of 1997 with the release of their action-RPG Diablo.On November 23, 2004, Blizzard released World of Warcraft, which has grown to become one of the most popular MMORPGs in history.On May 16, 2005, Blizzard announced the acquisition of Swingin' Ape, a console game maker, which is now Blizzard Console, currently working on Starcraft: Ghost, but in March 2006 (last mentioned on the website on March 30, 2006) they announced that Starcraft: Ghost was on indefinite hold.On August 1, 2005, Blizzard announced the consolidation of Blizzard North into the headquarters in Irvine, California.A few months after the closure of Blizzard North, Bill Roper, Erich Schaefer and his brother Max Schaefer co-founded Flagship Studios which now is developing Mythos (on July 19, 2008 it was announced that due to continuing financial hardships at Flagship Studios, Mythos would be going on hiatus)  and Hellgate London released in the fall of 2007.Blizzard is currently a division of Activision Blizzard, Inc. as a result of a merger that was announced on December 7th, 2007. The merger was completed on July 9th, 2008.[1]Notable Blizzard personel include:These are the following awards received for Blizzard Entertainment and Diablo related.[2] For other game awards, Template:Gamepedia and StarCraft.This section contains facts and trivia relevant to this article",
      "Blizzard North, formerly known as Condor, was the Bay Area division of Blizzard Entertainment, known for the Diablo series. The studio was originally based in Redwood City, California, and then moved a short distance away to San Mateo, California, with Blizzard proper being based in Irvine (in southern California).The name \"Condor\" came from Project Condor, a game developed in secret by employees of a digital clip art company that went under.[1] Condor was established in 1993, founded by Max Schaefer, Erich Schaefer, and David Brevik.[2] While the idea for Diablo existed early on,[1] publishers refused Condor's pitches, as the game would be PC exclusive, and the genre was seen as being too niche.[3] In order to stay afloat, the company developed a number of sports games and the Sega Genesis version of Justice League Task Force. While showing off the Genesis version, they came into contact with Silicon & Synapse, who had developed the Super Nintendo version (the game's publisher had not informed Condor of the separate publishing scheme). Silcon & Synapse would later be named Blizzard Entertainment, and after the release of Warcraft,[1] which Condor offerred beta services for,[3] came back into contact with Condor to hear their pitch for Diablo. Blizzard liked the pitch, and offered to publish the game. The game received a $300,000 budget. To bolster its finances, Condor worked on sports games on the side.[1]Condor was purchased by Blizzard about six months before the release of Diablo in 1996.[1] The announcement came in December, 1995, that Blizzard was interested in acquiring Condor. They decided to join Blizzard proper as they had been impressed with the release of Warcraft II, and given its widespread release, were impressed with Blizzard's distribution of its game. The deal was finalized in February, 1996. Condor was renamed \"Blizzard North,\" but was allowed to keep its autonomy.[4] During the development period, Condor had been on the brink of insolvency several times, but the game's success guaranteed their stability.[2] 3D0 made a counter-bid that would have offered more, but Condor chose Blizzard as the company cultures were more similar.[1]Structurally, Blizzard North was considered an independent studio from Blizzard South, but also reported to them. There was never a real structure on how Blizzard North had to operate in regards to its parent company.[5]Diablo proved to be incredibly successful, and their 2000 sequel Diablo II was more successful yet. An expansion pack followed the year after.By June 2003 two new games were in production. However on June 30 2003, several key employees left Blizzard North to form the new companies Flagship Studios (8 moved here) and Castaway Entertainment (9 moved here). The Blizzard North exodus continued on with around 30 employees leaving the company in total.The resignations were partly due to a conflict with Blizzard Entertainment's owner, Vivendi, and partly due to employees wishing to start something new. Back at Blizzard North, however, they would have a common effect; of the two unannounced games that were in production at the time, one was now forced to be canceled. Blizzard Entertainment has since said the canceled game was a \"Blizzard North kind of game\".On August 1 2005, Blizzard Entertainment announced the closure of Blizzard North. A key reason for the closure was Blizzard North's poor development of what was to be Diablo III which did not meet the expectations of Vivendi. Former Blizzard North staffers including Joseph Lawrence, Wyatt Cheng and Matt Uelman subsequently appeared in the credits of Blizzard's next retail release, World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. The work of former Blizzard North artist Phroilan Gardner was also featured in editions of World of Warcraft: The Trading Card Game around the same time.A few employees from the Diablo team, including Eric Sexton, Michio Okamura and Steven Woo, organized to launch a new company, Hyboreal Games.[6][7] Only a few joined Team 3 in development of Blizzard South's version of Diablo III.[8]Blizzard North had 12 members by the time it began work on Diablo I. This had reached 14/15 by the time of the game's release.[2] This increased to 24 at the start of development of Diablo II, and had grown to 40 by 2000.[10] Notable members included:",
      "Diablo hasn’t finished yet.Everyone’s favourite grind fest that is the Diablo series will soon have another game added to the series. Many people loved Diablo II and Diablo III with many players staying loyal to the games still to this day.Diablo III was released on 15th May 2012. That is over 6 years ago! I simply can’t believe that it has been that long. It is about time we got a new episode in this iconic series.Having said that Diablo II was released all the way back on 29th June 2000. Imagine taking 12 years to make a game – They must have taken a leaf out of GTA’s book.We know that a new Diablo game is coming as Blizzard posted a job listing on their website.The listing said this: “The minions of Hell are growing stronger… We’re working on a new, unannounced Diablo project.”The listing didn’t add much else in terms of what the game will be about or whether it will be part of the same world. It could be a whole new quest-line in a whole new world.The post does show however that the world will be similar to that of previous Diablo games. ‘Dark gothic’ does describe Diablo to a tee.“The ideal candidate works well in an environment of peers who are passionate about working on the dark gothic world of Diablo, making great games, killing millions of monsters and getting loot.”This is only a job listing so this might mean work on the new game hasn’t even begun yet so don’t hold your breath just yet.Will you be grinding your way through the demon filled world of the new Diablo game? Or will you be picking it up on Nintendo Switch?Let us know!Submit your content or videos and you could get featured!Submit your ContentSend this to a friend",
      "Two new job postings on the Blizzard website suggest that the developers are working on a brand new first-person title. An old one has also been updated, confirming that the Diablo team is expanding.If you missed BlizzCon 2016, catch up by following our coverage.Like many, my initial reaction was Overwatch, their current foray into the FPS scene, but the fact that it explicitly says \"Unannounced Games/Projects\" says it all. Damn, I wonder what they're up to? Some kind of spin-off of Overwatch?Could we be seeing single-player campaigns coming to the game? I think the Halloween Brawl was quite popular, and it may have motivated them to push for more single-player experiences. I really don't know though.Hmm, I don't see them working on two separate FPS-es. Single player for Overwatch ... also not seeing that. Probably something else, Overwatch related.",
      "Blizzard is hiring for a new, unannounced Diablo project.It looks like it may be time to start exercising that left index finger since Blizzard is bringing Diablo back for another round.Not that Diablo ever really left. Diablo 3 has gone through several iterations in its quest to become the ultimate hack-’n-slash ARPG, and while it has its detractors it has many more gamers that adamantly believe it’s the pinnacle of the genre.But let’s take a look at the wanted ad, shall we? According to the Blizzard careers page, they’re looking for a “dungeon artist” which is awfully specific. Blizzard may, in fact, be the only company in the world that needs artists to specifically create dungeons. Most other game companies call them something like “texture artists” or “level designers”.RELATED: BLIZZARD IS DEFINITELY TEASING DIABLO ON SWITCH, RIGHT?Oh, and have 3 years experience and a portfolio. An entry-level position this is not.We should also note this isn’t the first time we’ve had rumblings from Blizzard that Diablo is once again about to be resurrected. In 2016 they were looking for a new game director to \"lead the Diablo series into the future,\" and in 2015 they were searching for an art director. Presumably they found those people since now they’re filling in their team with specific experts, and it doesn’t get any more specific than “dungeon artist”.NEXT: SHAQ FU: A LEGEND REBORN REVIEW - NO ONE ASKED FOR THIS, BUT WE'RE HAPPY IT'S HERETags:\nDiabloBut it’s old. Diablo 3 originally came out in 2012, with the Reaper of Souls expansion coming out in 2014. It seems highly unlikely that Blizzard is going to expand a game that’s already 6 years old, so this can only mean one thing: sequel time.The successful applicant will naturally need to know all about art stuff like modeling, texturing, as well as 2D and 3D art assets. They also must be “passionate about working on the dark gothic world of Diablo.”There was plenty of room at the end of Diablo 3 for yet another sequel, so now comes the real question: what character classes will make their appearance in the next one?

      "By\nAndy Chalk\n2018-06-05T18:34:05.155ZAhead of BlizzCon 2017, Blizzard said there would be no Diablo-related announcement at the show. \"There will be a time for that at some point in the future,\" community manager Nevalistis explained, \"but that time is not now.\" It appears to be approaching, however. Multiple job listings on the Blizzard careers site say the studio is seeking environment, technical, and \"dungeon\" artists for a new Diablo game.\"The minions of Hell are growing stronger,\" the Dungeon Artist listing says. \"We're working on a new, unannounced Diablo project. Are you a skilled Dungeon Artist? Come work with us, and together we will build something exceptional.\"The other positions open in the same way, and my first impression is that they point to something entirely new, rather than a port or remaster of one of the existing games.The Dungeon Artist position, for instance, requires working directly with the level design team \"to build atmospheric dungeons with a focus on composition, detail and mood, while ensuring that the gameplay space is readable,\" and an \"exceptional understanding of form, shape, structure, composition and silhouette as it relates to world building and modeling.\"The Technical Artist \"will help the environment and prop teams define, create, maintain and streamline the modelling and world-building pipeline and processes to bring to life the world of Sanctuary,\" with responsibilities including \"forging tools, educating artists in the use of technology and helping them hit visual targets.\"Diablo designer David Brevik poured cold water on the idea of a quick Diablo 2 remake last year, saying that it might be a trickier proposition than anyone expects—in part because he believes most of the original assets are long gone.\"If they do a Diablo 2 Remaster, it’s going to be difficult to make it feel exactly like the same game,\" he said at the time. \"They could do it but they will have to go out of their way to ensure that they are simulating the way that the game works in 2D instead of making it 3D, if that makes sense.\"So maybe that's what all this artist-hiring is for—not a Diablo 4 (which would be great), but a tough-to-pull-off Diablo 2 do-over (which, for the record, would also be great). Blizzard, unsurprisingly, isn't inclined to spoil the surprise: \"We’re always exploring different ideas at Blizzard,\" a rep said. \"That includes Diablo, which is one of our core franchises.\"Whatever it turns out to be, I wouldn't recommend holding your breath for an announcement at E3, which is just a few days away.

      "Original Diablo designer David Brevik weighs in on Blizzard's Diablo III, and how the game might've been if Blizzard North hadn't been dissolved.At one point Blizzard North, who had made the original first two classic Diablo games, was making Diablo III...but ultimately its vision was scrapped and restarted. Blizzard eventually delivered a rampantly broken, weird, and jading mess in 2012 with the release of Diablo III on PC that ultimately betrayed the soul of its forebears. But despite its failures, Blizzard turned things around with Reaper of Souls and saved the game while introducing a long-term playtime that both Diablo and Diablo II significantly lacked. So what does David Brevik, who helped shape the franchise as we know it, have to say about Diablo III?\"I thought that they added a lot of really great stuff to it that fleshed it out and made it a much better game than I thought that it was at launch,\" Brevik said in a recent interview with IGN.Sadly Brevik also reveals that Blizzard North's Diablo III would've kept that harsh, demonic and gritty-dark art style we've come to expect from Diablo--not the cartoonish look we have today.\"Our art style up north was different than the art style from the guys down [at Blizzard South], and so in a lot of ways it was much more like Diablo II-looking than it was what Diablo III ended up looking like.\"I'd love to see--better yet play--Blizzard North's original Diablo III, but some things are just dead and buried.Meanwhile Blizzard is definitely working on something new Diablo-related but it won't be released any time soon.",
      "Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo revolutionized the computer role-playing game genre in 1996. While the game retained the fantasy trappings, loot reward systems, and experience progression mechanics of other RPGs, Diablo introduced fast-paced real-time combat to the mix. In addition, maps in Diablo were procedurally generated, meaning every player would experience a slightly different challenge. This kept the game fresh even for players who had poured dozens of hours into the title. Diablo, its Hellfire expansion, its sequel Diablo II, and that game's Lord of Destruction expansion were all smash hits for the still-young studio.The most recent game in the series, Diablo III in 2012 (along with its later expansions), continued the series' amazing track record. With over 30 million units sold across PCs and consoles, it ranks as one of the best-selling games of all time. Clearly, the market likes going to hell. As one of Blizzard's core properties, there's no doubt that a Diablo 4 is either in discussion or actively in the works at the Irvine, CA studio.And yet, for all that, it may not be coming anytime soon. Blizzard is one of the most unique developers in the industry, willing and able to iterate through different design prototypes for ages. Where any other studio would want to crank out a sequel for a quick buck, Blizzard has other priorities, and they are keeping Diablo 4 from your screens for the next little while. Here's why Blizzard won't release it — yet.Blizzard will spend more time crafting a game than nearly any other company in the industry, even if that means working on a single game for over a decade. The Diablo II expansion Lord of Destruction arrived in 2001, and like its predecessors, set the gaming world on fire with its slick design and wicked atmosphere. The team behind the franchise, Blizzard North, figured one expansion was enough, and thus began working on the next full release in the franchise. And they worked on it. And worked on it. And worked on it some more.For reasons that have never been publicly explained, Blizzard headquarters then decided to shutter their North branch in 2005. Along with that closure, they also decided to cancel all of the work that had been done on the new Diablo game up to that time. The Irvine crew formed a brand-new team to build a new Diablo III from scratch. This game would not see the light of day until 2012, fully seven years after the restart, which itself was begun four years after the original project.Blizzard has been blessed with a lot of success, so they have enough resources to pour into a single title over this kind of time. And with Diablo III, they proved they were willing to do so. So just because that game turned out to be a blockbuster doesn't mean that Diablo 4 is right around the corner. After all, it's only been a few years since the third game released. To Blizzard, that's less than the blink of an eye.So why does Blizzard spend so much time on development? Because for them, anything that isn't absolutely perfect won't do. Since the release of the original Warcraft: Orcs & Humans in 1994, the company has built up a reputation for the highest levels of innovation and quality. Their games aren't just 'good,' and they are not just 'influential': they are polished masterpieces that either define or redefine their genres. World of Warcraft. StarCraft. Overwatch. Hearthstone. It's a remarkable legacy.But even this studio can't strike solid gold every time. Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans was intended to be Blizzard's foray into the adventure game space. But once the project was effectively complete, it wasn't a genre-leading title: it was just another game. Blizzard wouldn't accept that, and cancelled a complete game that was ready to be released and earn money. Very few companies would ever think to do such a thing.They repeated this trick a few years later with StarCraft: Ghost, a brilliant-looking action game that, much like its protagonist, vanished before our eyes. And of course, there was that original version of Diablo III, which probably would have been another smash hit if Blizzard had only released it. Instead, they cancelled it, and spent another seven years crafting a different game with the same name.In other words, Blizzard's reputation — not games — is their core product. Anything that might, just might, harm it is cancelled or restarted. So they don't care if Diablo 4 is really great and ready to release soon; they would sooner start over from scratch and make it perfect.Eleven years, who knows how many dollars, and an endless amount of hype all resulted in one thing: the long-awaited release of Diablo III worldwide on May 15, 2012. Needless to say, old-school fans had been looking forward to this moment for over a decade. Even new players who loved Blizzard products were excited to try out the company's latest adventure. They bought the game. They installed it. They hit \"Play.\"But they lost to the ultimate boss: Error 37.This was the internal error code for a failure to connect to Blizzard's servers, a pervasive problem upon the game's release. Even though Diablo III had a single-player mode, everyone had to connect to the servers for some reason. And in this case, that meant a whole lot of people couldn't even play the product they'd just purchased. It took weeks for Blizzard to sort out the mess, but by then, a bad taste had been left in the mouths of a lot of dedicated fans. Blizzard's sterling reputation had taken a dent.Meanwhile, the game's Auction House system also turned out to be a problem. Intended to allow players to easily share loot they didn't want, for money if they so chose, the system instead ruined the overall progression path of the game. Eventually, the system was removed from the game altogether. Another failure for a company that hated that word.For Diablo 4, Blizzard will want to ensure a smooth player experience, and make sure any problematic systems are cut out before release. That'll take time. And Blizzard, of all companies, won't hesitate to wait if it means getting the game right.The main campaign for Diablo III isn't wildly long, and even inexperienced players can probably complete it in 15 to 20 hours. In theory, then, this should be the kind of game that you pick up, play, and then put down forever. Not so! Many players have logged hundreds of hours in Diablo III, and keep coming back for more. There are a lot of reasons for this, but one of the biggest is a system called Seasons.Essentially, a Season is a game-mode that only lasts for a certain period of time. During a Season, a player who opts into the mode will have to start a brand-new character from scratch. This has the effect of setting everyone back to square one: at the start of a Season, everybody runs un-leveled, un-geared heroes again. Blizzard then sets a number of challenges for them to complete, and it's a race to see who among the community, or who among your friends, can complete them first. Since everybody's starting from the same point, the race is one that anyone can win. Meanwhile, Season-specific rewards can only be earned during this period, and never again, so players are incentivized to try to play as much of each Season as they can.This long-running system has proven to be very popular, and it keeps an old game alive in the hearts of millions of players. Blizzard doesn't need Diablo 4 to keep the brand thriving: Diablo III is doing that work just fine all by itself, even years after its release.When the original Diablo burst onto the scene in 1996, it transformed what an action game could be. Fast-paced yet tactical, easy to pick up yet difficult to master, it was a near-perfect distillation of everything action games aspired to become, while simultaneously preserving everything that made RPG games such a sensation. The game led the industry forward, and with Diablo II, was a major factor in bringing games into the 21st Century.For all its massive success, Diablo III hasn't been nearly as influential. The third game in the franchise retained the top-down, isometric look of its '90s predecessors, keeping the camera way back from the action. While there are other indie titles that use that style as well, usually as an intentional throwback to a bygone era of gaming, there are no AAA experiences that currently use that format. Modern titles, such as God of War or Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, keep the camera close to the main character and the immediate environment. Rather than giving the player a bird's eye view, these games present a visceral ground-level experience. That also allows for far greater detail in the character models and the animations.Diablo 4, then, will have to reconcile the classic franchise format with these more modern tropes, without alienating old-school fans or potential new players. Otherwise, Diablo will not be a genre-defining series anymore, just a kind of updated relic from another time. Blizzard has no interest in rehashing the past: they want to shape the future. And they will take as much time as they need to hit on a design that does.As mentioned above, Blizzard takes an awful long time making their games. But there's a flip side to that coin: Blizzard has been supporting their active roster for longer and longer. StarCraft II is still getting attention from the company, even seven years after its release. World of Warcraft continues its astonishing run, even though it was released all the way back in 2004. And by all indications, Overwatch and its new eSports league is going to be around for a long, long time to come.To that end, Diablo 4 can't just be a fun game: it needs to be able to support an active fanbase for years. Blizzard may even possibly be looking to make it a long-running game-as-a-service, in which case it may be the only new Diablo game for a decade or more. Building a title that can stand up to that long test of time, and have the infrastructure necessary to constantly push new content, is no small feat: just ask the team that turned the failed Titan project into Overwatch.While the Seasons system in Diablo III has allowed fans to remain engaged with that game, a full-on service-oriented title is a whole new ballgame. Wedding the game-as-a-service philosophy with the tried-and-true Diablo formula will take a lot of care, attention, and, most of all, time. Plus, building out the systems necessary to maintain such a game over the long term is a large endeavor unto itself. Diablo 4 likely won't be the next Diablo III: it will be, in many respects, a bold new direction for the franchise.In 2016, Diablo III lost its director, Josh Mosqueira. Since taking the reins in 2013, Mosqueira had led many of the face-saving initiatives that rescued the game from itself, such as removing the Auction House. He would naturally be the man to lead the franchise into its next installment. But his departure left a hole behind him, and his replacement would have to get up to speed on the still-ongoing Diablo III before tackling a new project. At a bare minimum, this would have slowed down development, and further added to the production schedule.Interestingly, while Blizzard has almost certainly hired a new director, nobody really knows for sure! The company never announced if the role was ever filled, or who filled it. Is this person a veteran member of the Diablo III team? A talented director poached from another studio? A mysterious wanderer with a dark past, hellbent on revenge and redemption? We don't know! Whoever it is, that person will have a lot of work to do, and a massive legacy to live up to, and of course, Blizzard's reputation to manage. It's a lot of responsibility. And the best way to handle that responsibility is patience, and time.Which is yet another reason you won't be seeing Diablo 4 for a while yet.",
      "Earth. Year, unknown. A bleak future is before us. Humanity had survived, bereft of all benefits it used to…If you are an avid Diablo 3 player then you damn-well know that Blizzard has released the Diablo 3…The latest editions of Logitech gaming mice have been really good but it seems that they have gone more…They say that too many cooks may spoil the stew, but in Overcooked’s case there is no such thing…If you are an avid Diablo 3 player then you damn-well know that Blizzard has released the Diablo 3 content patch 2.4.3, which introduces a wide variety of changes that improve and streamline the company’s action RPG, Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls. The most painful thing about this long-awaited update is that it cannot really be described as actual content. Don’t expect new characters (or old ones) or any dialogue (apart from a few narrated scripts lurking around the levels). Blizzard is paying homage to its legendary RPG and polished Diablo 3 in the process. At times, it does feel too much like a gimmick, so we sincerely hope you didn’t anticipate some sort of remastered edition of Diablo 1, because that’s not what this is.Gamers enter the Adventure Mode and go to a specific section of Tristram. You just select ACT I on the map marked by the all-too-familiar Diablo pentagram. From here on all you have to do is teleport to that area, enter the portal and then clean out 16 dungeon levels. Three of my trusted Diablo 3 mates and myself (Male Crusader, Male Monk and Female Witch Doctor) were eager to try this thing out and see what awaits us. We were promised a fitting tribute to the cult classic, so we hopped into action.As you step through the portal, you’ll notice that the entire game was given a dandy little old-school makeover, now famously referred to as “glorious retrovision” (that’s what Blizzard calls it anyway). In short, the surroundings are pixelated and character animation movement won’t be as fluent or detailed as in Diablo 3. All this in an effort to recreate the vintage ambience, reminiscent of the developer’s RPG classic. Yeah, I also emphasize the word ‘reminiscent’ there, because, once again, this is not a graphically reworked version of the Diablo 1. Still, the look they were going for kind of works. It is a cool trait, one which I’m sure most Diablo fans will appreciate. Another cool element comes with the game’s retro-style sound effects, and more importantly, Matt Uelmen’s remarkable soundtrack from the original game. The Diablo 1 soundtrack is filled to the brim with exceptional themes and melodies. Those tunes are as creepy almost as much as they are beautiful, ranging from spine-chilling distant baby screams to the gentle tones of the acoustic guitar theme, crafted to suit the desolate and yet somehow appealingly peaceful town of Tristram.Blizzard also made some adjustments and included a few knick-knacks for passionate players of the Reaper of Souls expansion pack. For one thing, players that overcome 4 bosses in the D1-lookalike dungeons will unlock two new banners: Ogden’s Sign and Ogden’s Brew banners.  There’s the Red Soul Shard (Transmog), which appears once you’ve dealt a final blow to the Dark Lord from D1. My personal favorite is the inclusion of the famous Wirt’s Leg (Transmog) as well as Butcher’s Cleaver transmog – ah yes, those take me back indeed.We advise you not rush through the levels. Take the time to explore every nook and cranny in the 16 available dungeons. There are nods to the original around every corner and some them might bring a smile to your face, as your heart sinks into delightful nostalgia.We Raise Our Glasses to A Blizzard That’s No MoreBlizzard North and Blizzard Entertainment changed the landscape for PC RPGs back in December, 1996. For me personally, I consider Diablo 1 to be Blizzard’s first project where they effectively showcased just how brilliant they were at setting up a game with a breathtaking atmosphere. Blizzard captured the hearts of so many gamers around the world and to this day they manage to do so, albeit with different tools and for different reasons. The powerful corporation, now known as Blizzard Entertainment (owned by Activision Blizzard), has little to do with the original Diablo game. While Diablo 1 was released under the publishing arm of Blizzard Entertainment, the game itself emerged from the hearts and minds of two individuals – Bill Roper and Chris Metzen. They were both working for Blizzard North at the time, which was a separate studio entirely. Bill Roper left Blizzard in 2003, while Metzen departed in September, 2016.The current state of Blizzard’s creative branch is perhaps one of the most highly debated gaming topics in the past several years. The departure of certain creative leads within the core Blizzard’s team is almost certainly one of the main reasons why we’ve seen questionable content decisions and major changes in production, and unexpected moves the company’s title line-up. Diablo, StarCraft and Warcraft fan-bases have dwindled over the years. So, what Blizzard gave us here is a reminder. They were saying: “Ya remember a long time ago when we made an awesome game. The game that started it all? Well, this is kind of how it looked.” The Diablo 1 anniversary patch is a tribute to a brilliant game. Nothing more. An echo of what blizzard was once…Another Raised Glass to the Blizzard That is TodayToday, Blizzard stays ahead of the curve with its ability to tap into the current mass market and listen to what their fans are saying. On top of that, they are well-known for polishing the hell out of their products before release – no, I don’t mean they’re releases are perfect. Each major release suffers from issues, as much as any other major triple-A game (especially if it includes online multiplayer). However, Blizzard should be commended for hearing out the community – a tradition they demonstrated when they launched the Overwatch beta and then the full game after that.When Blizzard designed the Diablo 1 anniversary patch they turned to the fanbase and community for tips and source material – simply because the original designers did not have much documentation when they made the original. The cult, craze and detailed universe of Diablo was perpetuated throughout the years largely thanks to its loyal followers. In addition, with the tight schedule, Blizzard’s team did not have the time to recreate the old Diablo 1 UI. Still, a few designers devoted their spare time to accomplish this task, so now we have a lovely D1-style interface.This proves that there’s great passion for Diablo at Blizzard and we are going to see more cool things and more content in future. Until then, we wait for the next add-on for Diablo 3, which promises the return of the famed Necromancer character class, along with an array of new features, items, gear and locations. We wait for Blizzard to listen to the fans… to us. We wait for Blizzard to be brilliant again. We wait for them to do what they do best – make awesome games.The 16-level Diablo 1 dungeons will be available during the month of January and will return in that same period next year.Uros PavlovicPLAY!

      "By Chris Steyn and Mark Minnie• 6 August 2018The book is a collaboration between journalist Chris Steyn and former undercover narcotics agent Mark Anthony Dawid Minnie. They compare notes to deliver a shocking story of apartheid-era criminality, cover-ups and official complicity in the rape and murder of children. Here is the foreword, written by Marianne Thamm.In January 2015, an investigative team consisting of South African and Belgian police swooped on the home of a 37-year-old computer engineer, William Beale, located in the popular Garden Route seaside town of Plettenberg Bay. The raid on Beale came after months of meticulous planning that was part of an intercontinental investigation into an online child sex and pornography ring. The investigation was code-named Operation Cloud 9.Beale was the first South African to be arrested. He was snagged as a direct result of the October 2014 arrest by members of the Antwerp Child Sexual Exploitation Team of a Belgian paedophile implicated in the ring. South African police, under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Heila Niemand, co-operated with Belgian counterparts to expose the sinister network, which extended across South Africa and the globe. By July 2017, at least 40 suspects had been arrested, including a 64-year-old Johannesburg legal consultant and a 20-year-old Johannesburg student.What police found on Beale’s computer was horrifying. There were thousands of images and videos of children, and even babies, being abused, tortured, raped and murdered. In November 2017, Beale pleaded guilty to around 19,000 counts of possession of child pornography and was sentenced to 15 years in jail, the harshest punishment ever handed down in a South African court for the possession of child pornography.While Beale himself had not been arrested or convicted for physically harming the children, the court found that the possession of pornography is not a victimless crime. Somewhere in the world babies and children who featured in the hideous images had been abused, raped and murdered.In 2014, Peter McKelvie, a retired officer with the Hereford and Worcester Child Protection Team in the UK, disclosed that a list of child abusers, which included the names of at least 20 current and former UK politicians, existed and claimed that there had been a massive official cover-up of this in the 1980s. He was adamant that his findings warranted a formal investigation.McKelvie had compiled the list after interviewing myriad survivors, as well as officials in the care system who had dealt with them in the aftermath. The site of the abuse was the Elm Guest House in Barnes, South London. Prompted by McKelvie’s dossier, Scotland Yard eventually launched Operation Fernbridge.In May 2015, the British police launched Operation Hydrant, an overarching investigation that included Operation Fernbridge and an astounding number of smaller investigations into child sex abuse by prominent individuals in the UK. The police released statistics indicating that more than 1,400 men, including 261 high-profile individuals, were being investigated in relation to allegations of historical child abuse.While many ordinary people can, at a push, imagine themselves in the mind of a criminal – be it a thief, a cheat, an embezzler or even a murderer – it is virtually impossible to fathom the mind of the child sex offender. Perhaps it is because this crime – when adults tasked with caring for and protecting children actually abuse, rape and harm them – goes so against nature that it requires an enormous effort to engage and not look away in utter horror and disgust or, worse, retreat into denial. One need only read or listen to the testimony of those who have survived serial sexual abuse and rape as children to understand the havoc and damage this causes, leaving victims with wounds and scars that linger for the rest of their lives.There have been several exposures of child sex and paedophile rings in South Africa in recent years, but back in the late 1980s these cases seldom made headlines. The secrecy of the transgressions, and the close proximity to the victims by predatory adults, often in trusted or powerful positions, made this a difficult crime to detect and expose. But in 1986–87 a high-profile investigation involving three prominent National Party cabinet ministers and one of their associates suspected of abusing young boys blipped briefly on to the radar before disappearing completely. South Africans who were alive at the time may have a vague recollection of rather sanitised reports involving these political leaders – but that’s about it. Until now.The 1980s marked the beginning of the end of Nationalist government rule in South Africa, with increased violence, state repression and an iron-fisted clampdown on those considered by authorities to be political opponents. Apart from mass arrests, there were also several political assassinations by state-sanctioned secret death squads. Media freedom and freedom of speech and movement were severely curtailed, and the restriction and intimidation of newspaper editors and journalists was routine.The tumultuous era saw the declaration of two states of emergency, one in 1985 and another in 1988, which suspended the country’s then constitution, providing wide powers to the police and the South African Defence Force (SADF), then under the control of the hugely powerful Magnus Malan, minister of defence in President PW Botha’s cabinet.Magnus André de Merindol Malan was a blue-blooded Afrikaner Nationalist who rose through the military ranks and had always been destined for high office. A military man all his life, who also trained in the US, Malan was appointed chief of staff of the South African Army (SAA) in 1973. Three years later, he was appointed head of the SADF. The minister of defence at this time was future South African president PW Botha, who later appointed the trusted Malan as his defence minister.It would be safe to say that Malan was the second-most powerful man in apartheid South Africa, which towards the late 1980s was slowly imploding. The country was gripped by a permanent sense of impending crisis. Crime and violence were rampant as a low-grade civil war raged, mostly in the townships where South Africa’s black majority had been forcibly removed and “contained”. It is against this disruptive and turbulent backdrop that the shocking story you are about to read took place.The writers of the two narratives contained in this work, Mark Anthony Dawid Minnie and Chris Steyn, had never compared notes until Minnie, haunted by his past as an undercover narcotics agent with the South African Police in Port Elizabeth in the 1980s, delivered his account of the story to the publisher.Both Mark and Chris had spent a considerable amount of time investigating the same case, but somehow, until the publisher brought them together in 2017 to write this book, their paths had crossed only briefly.In 1987 Chris Steyn began working at the English-language morning newspaper the Cape Times. She was a rara avis in a newsroom then populated by young, mostly white, “leftie” journalists, including myself. Chris stood out immediately. She didn’t dress like the rest of us. She was always impeccably groomed, wearing tailored jackets and high heels and carrying a briefcase. She was also Afrikaans-speaking, or so we thought, which in those claustrophobic times led to immediate stereotyping and a modicum of suspicion. Which is odd, because some of the country’s most vociferous anti-apartheid journalists were Afrikaners – such as Max du Preez, Pearlie Joubert and Jacques Pauw, to name only a few.Chris came to the Cape Times trailed by a frisson of political intrigue. As she recounted in her 2006 memoir, Publish and Be Damned: Two Decades of Scandals, some news stories are neither forgotten nor forgiven. In Chris’s case, the “Boesak Affair” was one such story. ‘I had no way of knowing it would transform me from an accidental journalist into an enemy of the State,’ she wrote.The Boesak story requires a short retelling as it encapsulates so many of the currents that flowed through and beneath South African life back then. In January 1985, Chris had been drawn into the story about the hugely popular anti-apartheid activist cleric Allan Boesak, a member of the South African Council of Churches (SACC), when Michael Shafto, who was then Chris’s news editor at the Johannesburg daily The Star, handed her a pamphlet that had mysteriously turned up in the newsroom in-tray.Shafto tasked Chris with investigating the pamphlet, which featured a photograph of Boesak alongside one Dianne Melanie Scott, an SACC official. The pamphlet alleged that Boesak, a father of four, was having an affair with Scott. It detailed a series of hotel and chalet bookings allegedly proving that Boesak and Scott had had several romantic trysts.Chris, a meticulous, dogged and hugely professional journalist, set about verifying the information in the pamphlet through telephone calls and visits to each establishment. During her investigation Chris learned that the security police had visited the Johannesburger Hotel the night before Boesak had checked in and had asked staff to let them know when the cleric arrived. The feared security police were known for their “black ops” and dirty tricks aimed at prominent anti-apartheid activists. Later, a mysterious recording of Boesak and Scott talking inside another hotel room, this time at the President Holiday Inn, also found its way to Shafto’s in-tray.Chris, along with then crime reporter Mike Cohen, confronted the security police with the evidence and soon learned that it was indeed they who had sent the evidence to The Star as well as several other newspapers, including the Sunday Times, which, after Boesak had denied the allegations, took it no further. But the security police denied, on the record, their involvement in the set-up.Chris herself was faced with a dilemma. Boesak was having an affair with Scott: he admitted as much to Chris when she called him for comment. Boesak, says Chris, told her he had known the security police had been trailing him and that the information might be leaked. In the end the decision to publish the story, exposing the affair as well as the role the security police had played in bringing it to light, was taken by The Star’s then editor-in-chief, Harvey Tyson.Then came the fallout. First Boesak, contacted by other newspapers and news agencies following up on The Star story, denied the affair. The security police and the police commissioner also denied their official involvement in trying to smear the cleric. The Star, Tyson and Chris found themselves under attack from various quarters, including the opposition Progressive Federal Party and other newspapers.But Tyson defended his decision to publish the story as well as Chris’s credibility and professionalism, even when the Cape Times editor Tony Heard had lashed out against the story in an editorial. Heard labelled the publication of the story “an extraordinary lapse from established standards of respect for privacy” and had warned that this “breach of established practice” was an “aberration”.Tyson and Heard communicated privately, Tyson reminding Heard that the Cape Times had not always been silent on the private affairs of politicians. Heard believed that Tyson had played into the hands of state agents, while Tyson insisted that the story was in the public interest, exposing not only Boesak’s hypocrisy but also the state’s dirty tricks. It was complicated and fraught – and Chris Steyn was caught in the middle.By the end of 1985, Chris had established herself as one of the most prolific, ingenious and fearless journalists in South Africa. Having had enough of Joburg, she packed up her life and headed for Cape Town and a new job at the Cape Times.But Chris soon found herself on the wrong side of the law, which is not a difficult accomplishment in a virtual police state. In 1986 the police subpoenaed Chris to give evidence against a source she had interviewed. This source had provided information about the deaths of eight people and the injury of seven others in separate hand-grenade and limpet-mine blasts in the East Rand townships of Duduza, Tsakane and KwaThemba in June 1985. Six of those killed had their right hands blown off. Chris’s source, as well as other residents and witnesses, had contradicted the police finding that the men had “accidentally” blown themselves up when the grenades exploded prematurely while the victims were carrying out what the authorities had described as a “co-ordinated terrorist attack”.So it was that Chris found herself ordered to appear before a Johannesburg magistrate on 6 August 1986. She was expected to give evidence in the trial of three men who had been accused of contravening section 27(b) of the Police Act, a section designed to deal with people the state claimed had “lied” about the police. Among the accused was one of the township residents Chris had interviewed a year earlier with regard to the hand-grenade blasts.Chris was served with a subpoena in terms of section 205 of the Criminal Procedure Act. This section of the law gave police the power to demand that an individual appear before a magistrate, in secret if needs be, and without legal representation, and to reveal under oath the names of sources or any other information required. Section 205 had been deliberately formulated to destroy the ability and capacity of journalists to protect sources.Shortly after the subpoena, Chris received information that some sources had “changed their stories” after they had been visited by police. One source’s memory had been jogged by a gun held in each ear. The version of events recounted to Chris by the township resident she interviewed no longer stood. He had “admitted” to lying about the police. The implications were serious, not only for the source, but for Chris. In the ultimate irony, Chris was being subpoenaed to testify against her source by reiterating his original story in court under oath.There were only two possible outcomes. If Chris testified against him, the source would be convicted of lying about the police and would go to jail for up to five years. If Chris refused to testify, she would go to jail until she cracked and agreed to comply with the subpoena. It was a classic Catch-22.For Chris, while the case against her source was clearly political, her considerations were not. She saw it as a matter of principle, a simple question of ethics. The unbreakable rule of journalism applied: never reveal the identity of a source to those who would wish them harm for telling the truth.Despite intense legal efforts, Chris was informed that there was no hope of her escaping a prison sentence if she turned up in court and refused to testify. And if she simply didn’t pitch, she would eventually be arrested and imprisoned. The latter became a real possibility when Chris failed to appear at the 6 August hearing. A warrant for her arrest was issued but held over, pending a second appearance scheduled for 21 August.Meanwhile, given the sinister fates that had befallen many detainees and inmates, there were rising fears for Chris’s safety and it was decided, in the greatest secrecy, that she should leave the country and continue the fight for truth from abroad. Her “escape” was duly plotted in bouts of intense whispering in a corner of the Café Royal, the watering hole of the Cape Town Press Club, across the road from Newspaper House, the iconic building that was home to the Cape Times and The Argus. Chris continued with her normal work routine until the last minute.On the morning of her escape, Chris had endured a tense time with members of the Peninsula Murder and Robbery Squad hovering around her house in Tamboerskloof just in case she received a phone call from a murdered man’s lover who had made contact with her a day earlier. If the detectives had any inkling that Chris was about to skip the country, she would have been arrested on the spot.Chris finally left South Africa on Saturday 16 August without knowing whether she would ever be able to return. When she failed to appear at the second scheduled court hearing on 21 August, the order for her arrest was finalised.Chris lived in exile in England for a few months, waiting for the charges against the source to be “temporarily” withdrawn. But it would take many years for the truth in that case to finally emerge. She later learned from police sources how some of their technically minded colleagues had doctored the time fuses on hand grenades and limpet mines so that they would explode immediately upon arming. They then swapped these munitions for similar ones in known arms caches that were subsequently used by activists. Several activists were eliminated in the process.In October 1996, former police commissioner General Johan van der Merwe disclosed in his submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) that he had been the brain behind the hand-grenade blasts. Five years later, in 2001, the TRC granted amnesty to 13 Security Branch policemen in connection with the East Rand grenade blasts, the factual reporting of which had led to charges against people for telling the truth – and an arrest warrant and exile for Chris for reporting that truth.While all this was happening to Chris in Cape Town, about 700km away in Port Elizabeth, known as South Africa’s “friendly city” nestled on the shore of the Eastern Cape, Mark Minnie was embroiled in an investigation of his own, one that would lead him to some of the most powerful men in the country.Mark grew up in Port Elizabeth and joined the South African Police after matriculating at the end of 1978. His intention was to spend two years in the police force, and then study law at university. But after donning the blue uniform, Mark fell in love with being a cop. It felt to him as if he had found his true calling.After a six-month stint at the Police College in Pretoria, Mark was assigned to the Special Guard unit, responsible for the welfare and security of National Party government ministers. This is truly ironic given that, years later, the actions of certain cabinet ministers would lead to him resigning from the force. A year later, Mark was transferred to the Uniform Branch in Port Elizabeth, a position he held for five years. He spent his last couple of years as a full-time cop working as an agent attached to the South African Narcotics Bureau in Port Elizabeth. It was during that time that Mark found himself embroiled in the investigation described in this book.In 1987 Chris Steyn made it back to South Africa and began to follow up on a series of perplexing events, including the apparent suicide of a well-known cabinet minister and his close friend – a conservationist, diver and police reserve lieutenant.From opposite ends of the country, 30 years later, Chris and Mark would finally connect the dots to rip the veil of secrecy off the tragic and shocking story of abuse, criminality, cover-ups and official complicity in the rape and possible murder of a number of children, most of them vulnerable and black.These children are the Lost Boys of Bird Island.

      "Las Vegas mass murderer Stephen Paddock had become impotent, it has been revealed.His girlfriend Marilou Danley told investigators that he had lost interest in sex before he went on to gun down 58 people last October.She says that Paddock was ‘unable to perform’ and sex left him ‘exhausted’ as investigators searched for a motive into the shootings.However, the final police report into the massacre is unable to provide a motive.PHOTOS: Mourning The Dead – Las Vegas Massacre Victims IdentifiedBut detectives were able to determine some character traits of the 64-year-old killer.Based on interviews with Danley and other friends the report concludes that he was as an aloof narcissist, uninterested in politics or religion, who often developed heavy obsessions with any hobby he took up before quickly losing interest and dropping it entirely.Based on interviews with his small circle of friends, the report describes Paddock, 64, as an aloof narcissist, uninterested in politics or religion, who developed heavy obsessions with any hobby he took up before quickly losing interest entirely.Danley, 63, a Philippines native who later became and Australian citizen before moving to the US, met Paddock in Reno, Nevada, where she was working as a high-limit casino host.PHOTOS: Las Vegas Shooter Girlfriend’s Family Hires Criminal Defense AttorneyPaddock would often visit her casino, where he was known as a high roller.And after several years, their relationship developed from professional to romantic. By 2015 she quit her job so that they could travel more together while he paid her a monthly allowance.The couple took many cruises and international trips together, including vacations to the Mediterranean, the Bahamas, Dubai, and Asia.She revealed their relationship was ‘very romantic’ in the beginning, ‘she noticed a gradual decline in affection.’PHOTOS: Sick Shooter Exposed: Las Vegas Murderer Stephen Paddock’s Private Family PhotosHe claimed to have a ‘chemical imbalance’ and often complained of being sick, telling Danley that ‘doctors couldn’t cure him’, the report stated.Paddock banned her from wearing make-up and perfume claiming he was allergic.However, his doctor revealed that his only recent ailment was a muscle tear but he suspected he was bipolar. But the killer refused to take medication or even discuss it.Danley told investigators Paddock was physiologically able to have sex, but the physical act would exhaust him. Danley stated he would often sleep for long periods after physical exertion.Investigators later found images of child pornography on his computer while he also had a stockpile of guns.Danley was later cleared by the authorities of having any part in shootings – she believed his collecting guns was just a hobby.We pay for juicy info!

Sindhu is no doubt one of the greatest sportspersons in India but the way she falters in the finals regularly keeps her away from the glory. The 23-year old shuttler's recent loss is against Carolina Marin in BWF World Championships. She gave a tough time to Marin in the first game, but in the second she was totally trapped under the Spanish shuttler's mind games. She lost the match 19-21, 10-21 and had to be satisfied with the silver yet again.Sindhu is an exceptional and technically gifted player but she has not been able to handle the big-final-pressure till now. The way she played throughout the tournament she became the crowd favourite but the hype around her gold medal chances crumbled again. It's the right time for the Indian shining star to take her time and change her mindset for the such crucial finals.Here is a list of some instances when PV Sindhu lost in major finals:PV Sindhu became the household name in the nation when she entered the final of the Rio Olympics. Indian fans were cheering for the Women's Gold medalist, but the 23-year old shuttler could not keep her calm and lost to Carolina Marin by 19-21, 21-12, 21-15. She dropped the big round one lead to the Spaniard and even today Marin is her No.1 nemesis.In 2017 Sindhu was the top athlete trending all across the country after entering the finals of  BWF Badminton World Championships and the nation was expecting something big from Sindhu after the Rio disappointment. The girl from Hyderabad was on fire in the finals against Japan's Nozomi Okuhara.

There is a hidden irony in the current definition and \r\n\t\t\t\tthe original myth of Theseus and the Minotaur's lair, within which one \r\n\t\t\t\tcould get lost in forever. Unlike a maze, which refers to a complex branching puzzle with \r\n\t\t\t\tchoices of path and direction; the 'classic'  labyrinth \r\n\t\t\t\tdesign has only a single, non-branching path, which \r\n\t\t\t\tleads to the centre. A labyrinth in this sense has a single, \r\n\t\t\t\tunambiguous route to the centre and back and is not designed to \r\n\t\t\t\tbe difficult to navigate, so Theseus would have had little need \r\n\t\t\t\tfor Ariadne's thread.\nWe do not know \r\n\t\t\t\twhen the labyrinth structure first was conceived, but \r\n\t\t\t\tthere are several incidences among the ideograms carved into rock faces across \r\n\t\t\t\tNeolithic and 'Bronze-age' Europe. We see the ideogram later on \r\n\t\t\t\tan Etruscan vase from c. 550 B.C. Later, at about 300 B.C., it was used on coins in Crete. \r\n\t\t\t\tDuring the middle-ages, it was used in European Cathedrals for \r\n\t\t\t\tpilgrimage.  \n\n\r\n\t\t\t \nThe Labyrinth as a Spiritual \r\n\t\t\tTool.\n\nA labyrinth is an \r\n\t\t\t\tarchetype with which we can have a direct experience. We can \r\n\t\t\t\twalk it. It is a metaphor for life's journey. It is a symbol \r\n\t\t\t\tthat creates a sacred space which leads us into its heart, then \r\n\t\t\t\tback out again along the same path. Although one is able to \r\n\t\t\t\tcross the lines at any time, we are compelled to follow the \r\n\t\t\t\tmeandering path to the centre and back again. \nThe Labyrinth \r\n\t\t\t\trepresents both a journey to our own centre and back out again \r\n\t\t\t\tinto the world... at the same time as acting as a metaphor for \r\n\t\t\t\tthe path we walk throughout our lives. \nThere is no \r\n\t\t\t\tgetting lost in a Labyrinth. Rather, one is offered a path that \r\n\t\t\t\tweaves back and forth, in and out, until it ends in a central \r\n\t\t\t\tcircular area. Here, walkers pause to reflect before departing \r\n\t\t\t\tas they came, carrying back wisdom gained on the inbound \r\n\t\t\t\tjourney. Labyrinth walkers say the certitude of the pathknowing \r\n\t\t\t\tall decisions about direction have been madefrees them to focus \r\n\t\t\t\ton contemplation instead of navigation. Some call this prayer; \r\n\t\t\t\tothers, deep reflection. Whatever the name, the practice has \r\n\t\t\t\tbeen used to nourish the soul around the world for several \r\n\t\t\t\tthousand of years. \nThe Labyrinth \r\n\t\t\t\tis a powerful geometric symbol with which we have formed an \r\n\t\t\t\talmost symbiotic relationship, which allows us to enter within \r\n\t\t\t\tits physical form at the same time as entering into a \r\n\t\t\t\tnon-physical communication with ourselves.\nBecause they \r\n\t\t\t\tare so ancient, the various interpretations of the Labyrinth \r\n\t\t\t\ttoday may not agree with the same concept of the labyrinths in \r\n\t\t\t\tancient times. It is curious then that the same identical symbol \r\n\t\t\t\tis found in countries and major religious traditions from around \r\n\t\t\t\tthe ancient world (such as India, France, Egypt, Scandinavia, \r\n\t\t\t\tCrete, Sumeria, America, the British Isles, and Italy), and that \r\n\t\t\t\tin all cases, they share a common theme of pilgrimage and \r\n\t\t\t\tspiritual reward. This has led some claim they represent a \r\n\t\t\t\tuniversal pattern in human consciousness.\n\r\n \n\n\n \nThe Geometry of the 'classic' \r\n\t\t\t\t7-circuit Labyrinth\n\n\nAll 'classic' labyrinths are based on a simple \r\n\t\t\t\tgeometric template. \nThe ancient \r\n\t\t\t\tseven-circuit labyrinth (so called because the path creates \r\n\t\t\t\tseven concentric rings around the centre) is rich with \r\n\t\t\t\tsymbolism. It draws on the mystical quality of the 7, a number \r\n\t\t\t\tof transformation and vision. In medieval times, the seven \r\n\t\t\t\tcircuits were seen to correspond to the seven visible planets, \r\n\t\t\t\tand a walk in the labyrinth was a cosmic journey through the \r\n\t\t\t\theavens. The seven circuits can also be seen to represent the \r\n\t\t\t\tdays of the week, the chakras, colours, or musical tones. \n\nSome research \r\n\t\t\t\tsuggests that the geometric shape [of a labyrinth] produces an \r\n\t\t\t\tenergy field that can heal ailments of the body and calm the \r\n\t\t\t\tmind. It balances thoughts with the presence of the body to the \r\n\t\t\t\tpoint where one stops thinking and the intuition of knowingness \r\n\t\t\t\ttakes over (4)\n\n\r\n\t\t\t \n\r\n\t\t\t \n \nProto Labyrinths..? \n\nPrehistoric \r\n\t\t\tlabyrinths have also been found carved on rock faces at Pontevedra, \r\n\t\t\tSpain and at Val Camonica in northern Italy, these latter ones are \r\n\t\t\tattributed to the late Bronze Age. The Rocky Valley labyrinths in \r\n\t\t\tCornwall, England, are supposed to be from the Bronze Age. The \r\n\t\t\tlabyrinth is found etched into the sands of the Nazca Plain in Peru, \r\n\t\t\tin use among the Caduveo people of Brazil and scratched on boulders \r\n\t\t\tand rockfaces in Northern Mexico, New Mexico and Arizona. \nIt is suggested \r\n\t\t\tthat the Labyrinth evolved from the spiral.\n\r\n\t\t\t  \r\n\t\t\t\nAchnabreck, \r\n\t\t\tScotland (left), and Knowth, Ireland \r\n\t\t\t(Right).\n \n\nThe Glastonbury Labyrinth:\nIt is proposed that the strong \r\n\t\t\t\tterracing on the sides of the Tor represent a classic '7-circuit \r\n\t\t\tlabyrinth' in three dimensional form. \n\n\n\n\nThe Tor is a natural \r\n\t\t\thill, but it has been established that it was altered in shape from \r\n\t\t\tthe late Neolithic onwards. Whether or not the terraces were cut to \r\n\t\t\treplicate the 'classic' Labyrinth shape is still conjectural but the \r\n\t\t\tlocation, and the tor's reputation as the 'Sacred Heart of England' \r\n\t\t\tmakes it possible that the terraces were the final part of a pilgrim \r\n\t\t\troute. \n (More \r\n\t\t\tabout Glastonbury Tor)\n \nThe 'Lost' \r\n\t\t\t\tLabyrinth of Egypt.\n\n\nHerodotus (c. \r\n\t\t\t484-424 BC) describes his visit to the now 'lost' labyrinth after \r\n\t\t\tdescribing how the Egyptians divided the land into twelve parts, or\r\n\t\t\tnomes, and set a king over each, he says that they agreed to \r\n\t\t\tcombine together to leave a memorial of themselves. They constructed \r\n\t\t\tthe Labyrinth, just above Lake Moeris, and nearly opposite the city \r\n\t\t\tof crocodiles (Crocodilopolis). \"I found it,\" he says, \"greater than \r\n\t\t\twords could tell, for, although the temple at Ephesus and that at \r\n\t\t\tSamos are celebrated works, yet all of the works and buildings of \r\n\t\t\tthe Greeks put together would certainly be inferior to this \r\n\t\t\tlabyrinth as regards labour and expense.\" Even the pyramids, he \r\n\t\t\ttells us, were surpassed by the Labyrinth. \"It has twelve covered \r\n\t\t\tcourts, with opposite doors, six courts on the North side and six on \r\n\t\t\tthe South, all communicating with one another and with one wall \r\n\t\t\tsurrounding them all. There are two sorts of rooms, one sort above, \r\n\t\t\tthe other sort below ground, fifteen hundred of each sort, or three \r\n\t\t\tthousand in all.\" He says that he was allowed to pass through the \r\n\t\t\tupper rooms only, the lower range being strictly guarded from \r\n\t\t\tvisitors, as they contained the tombs of the kings who had built the \r\n\t\t\tLabyrinth, also the tombs of the sacred crocodiles. The upper rooms \r\n\t\t\the describes as being of super-human size, and the system of \r\n\t\t\tpassages through the courts, rooms, and colonnades very intricate \r\n\t\t\tand bewildering. The roof of the whole affair, he says, is of stone \r\n\t\t\tand the walls are covered with carvings. Each of the courts is \r\n\t\t\tsurrounded by columns of white stone, perfectly joined. Outside the \r\n\t\t\tLabyrinth, and at one corner of it, is a pyramid about 240 feet in \r\n\t\t\theight, with huge figures carved upon it and approached by an \r\n\t\t\tunderground passage.\nStrabo, who lived \r\n\t\t\tabout 400 years after Herodotus also described them first hand. \r\n\t\t\tAfter referring to the lake and the manner in which it is used as a \r\n\t\t\tstorage reservoir for the water of the Nile, he proceeds to describe \r\n\t\t\tthe Labyrinth, \"a work equal to the Pyramids.\" He says it is \"a \r\n\t\t\tlarge palace composed of as many palaces as there were formerly \r\n\t\t\tnomes. There are an equal number of courts, surrounded by \r\n\t\t\tcolumns and adjoining one another, all in a row and constituting one \r\n\t\t\tbuilding, like a long wall with the courts in front of it. The \r\n\t\t\tentrances to the courts are opposite the wall; in front of these \r\n\t\t\tentrances are many long covered alleys with winding \r\n\t\t\tintercommunicating passages, so that a stranger could not find his \r\n\t\t\tway in or out unless with a guide. Each of these structures is \r\n\t\t\troofed with a single slab of stone, as are also the covered alleys, \r\n\t\t\tno timber or any other material being used.\" If one ascends to the \r\n\t\t\troof, he says, one looks over \"a field of stone.\" The courts were in \r\n\t\t\ta line, supported by a row of twenty-seven monolithic columns, the \r\n\t\t\twalls also being constructed of stones of as great a size. \"At the \r\n\t\t\tend of the building is the royal tomb, consisting of a square \r\n\t\t\tpyramid and containing the body of Imandes.\" Strabo says that \r\n\t\t\tit was the custom of the twelve nomes of Egypt to assemble, with \r\n\t\t\ttheir priests and priestesses, each nome in its own court, \r\n\t\t\tfor the purpose of sacrificing to the gods and administering justice \r\n\t\t\tin important matters.\n(More \r\n\t\t\tabout the 'Lost' Labyrinth of Egypt)\n \nThe Minoan Labyrinth, \r\n\t\t\tCrete:\n\nIn Greek \r\n\t\t\t\tmythology, the Labyrinth was an elaborate structure designed and \r\n\t\t\t\tbuilt by the legendary craftsman Daedalus for King Minos of \r\n\t\t\t\tCrete at Knossos to conceal the Minotaur.\n'At that \r\n\t\t\t\ttime there reigned at Knossos, in Crete, a monarch called Minos, \r\n\t\t\t\twho held sway over what was then the most powerful maritime \r\n\t\t\t\tstate in the Mediterranean. Minos had a son named Androgeos, \r\n\t\t\t\twho, during his travels in Attica, was treacherously set upon \r\n\t\t\t\tand slain, or so his father was informed. In consequence of this \r\n\t\t\t\tMinos imposed a penalty on the Athenians in the form of a \r\n\t\t\t\ttribute to be paid once every nine years, such tribute to \r\n\t\t\t\tconsist of seven youths and seven maidens, who were to be \r\n\t\t\t\tshipped to Knossos at the appointed periods.\nThere was at \r\n\t\t\t\tthe court of Minos an exceedingly clever and renowned artificer \r\n\t\t\t\tor engineer, Daedalus by name, to whom all sorts of miraculous \r\n\t\t\t\tinventions are ascribed. This Daedalus had devised an ingenious \r\n\t\t\t\tstructure, the \"Labyrinth,\" so contrived that if anybody were \r\n\t\t\t\tplaced therein he would find it practically impossible to \r\n\t\t\t\tdiscover the exit without a guide.\nThe \r\n\t\t\t\tLabyrinth was designed as a dwelling for, or at any rate was \r\n\t\t\t\tinhabited by, a hideous and cruel being called the Minotaur, a \r\n\t\t\t\tmonstrous offspring of Queen Pasiphaë, wife of Minos. The \r\n\t\t\t\tMinotaur is described as being half man and half bull, or a man \r\n\t\t\t\twith a bull's head, a ferocious creature that destroyed any \r\n\t\t\t\tunfortunate human beings who might come within its power. \r\n\t\t\t\tAccording to report, the youths and maidens of the Athenian \r\n\t\t\t\ttribute were periodically, one by one, thrust into the \r\n\t\t\t\tLabyrinth, where, after futile wanderings in the endeavour to \r\n\t\t\t\tfind an exit, they were finally caught and slain by the \r\n\t\t\t\tMinotaur'. (1)\n\nThere are many \r\n\t\t\tversions of the legend, some of them greatly at variance with \r\n\t\t\tothers. For instance, Philochorus, an eminent writer on the \r\n\t\t\tantiquities of Athens, gives in his \"Atthis\" a very rationalistic \r\n\t\t\taccount of the affair, stating that the Labyrinth was nothing but a \r\n\t\t\tdungeon where Minos imprisoned the Athenian youths until such time \r\n\t\t\tas they were given as prizes to the victors in the sports that were \r\n\t\t\theld in honour of his murdered son. He held also that the monster \r\n\t\t\twas simply a military officer, whose brutal disposition, in \r\n\t\t\tconjunction with his name, Tauros, may have given rise to the \r\n\t\t\tMinotaur myth.\n\n\n\nThese 5th - 3rd \r\n\t\t\t\tcentury BC coins from Knossos were struck with the labyrinth \r\n\t\t\t\tsymbol. The predominant labyrinth form during this period is the \r\n\t\t\t\tsimple 7-circuit style known as the classical labyrinth. \n\n\n(More \r\n\t\t\tabout Knossos, Crete)\n \nThe Nazca Labyrinth:\n\n\n</body>\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA five-year \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstudy by British archaeologists has shed new \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlight on the enigmatic drawings created by \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Nazca people between 100 BC and CE 700 \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the Peruvian desert.

But for the employment of these words the labyrinth in \r\n\t\t\tquestion might well have been conceived to be a Roman relic utilised \r\n\t\t\tby the builders of the church to ornament their pavement. Such \r\n\t\t\tpavement-labyrinths, however, with or without central figures or \r\n\t\t\tother embellishments, and of various dimensions and composition, are \r\n\t\t\tfound in many of the old churches of France and Italy.\n\n\nAs to the function \r\n\t\t\tand meaning of the old church labyrinths, various opinions have been \r\n\t\t\theld. Some authorities have thought that they were merely introduced \r\n\t\t\tas a symbol of the perplexities and intricacies which beset the \r\n\t\t\tChristian's path. Others considered them to typify the entangling \r\n\t\t\tnature of sin or of any deviation from the rectilinear path of \r\n\t\t\tChristian duty. It has often been asserted, though on what evidence \r\n\t\t\tis not clear, that the larger examples were used for the performance \r\n\t\t\tof miniature pilgrimages in substitution for the long and tedious \r\n\t\t\tjourneys formerly laid upon penitents. Some colour is lent to this \r\n\t\t\tsupposition by the name \"Chemin de Jérusalem.\" at Chartres (see \r\n\t\t\tbelow). In the days of the first crusades it was a common practice \r\n\t\t\tfor the confessor to send the peccant members of his flock either to \r\n\t\t\tfight against the infidel, or, after the victory of Geoffrey of \r\n\t\t\tBouillon, to visit the Holy Sepulchre. As enthusiasm for the \r\n\t\t\tcrusades declined, shorter pilgrimages were substituted, usually to \r\n\t\t\tthe shrine of some saint, such as Our Lady of Loretto, or St. Thomas \r\n\t\t\tof Canterbury, and it is quite possible that, at a time when the \r\n\t\t\tsoul had passed out of the crusades and the Church's authority was \r\n\t\t\ton the ebb, a journey on the knees around the labyrinth's \r\n\t\t\tsinuosity's was prescribed as an alternative to these pilgrimages. \r\n\t\t\tPerhaps this type of penance was from the first imposed on those \r\n\t\t\twho, through weakness or any other reason, were unable to undertake \r\n\t\t\tlong travels.\nThis view seems to \r\n\t\t\trest chiefly on a statement by J. B. F. Géruzez in his \"Description \r\n\t\t\tof the City of Rheims\" (1817), to the effect that the labyrinth \r\n\t\t\twhich formerly lay in the cathedral was in origin an object of \r\n\t\t\tdevotion, being the emblem of the interior of the Temple of \r\n\t\t\tJerusalem, but Géruzez quotes no authority for his assertion. \r\n\t\t\tAnother explanation, based upon the occurrence of the figures of the \r\n\t\t\tarchitects or founders in certain of the designs, is that the \r\n\t\t\tlabyrinth was a sort of masonic seal, signifying that the pious aim \r\n\t\t\tof the builder had been to raise to the glory of God a structure to \r\n\t\t\tvie with the splendours of the traditional Labyrinth. It is also \r\n\t\t\tsaid that in some cases the \"Chemins\" were used for processional \r\n\t\t\tpurposes.\nSome writers have \r\n\t\t\theld that the labyrinth was inserted in the church as typifying the \r\n\t\t\tChristian's life or the devious course of those who yield to \r\n\t\t\ttemptation. Some have thought that it represented the path from the \r\n\t\t\thouse of Pilate to Calvary, pointing out that Chateaubriand, in his \r\n\t\t\t\"Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem,\" mentioned two hours as the period \r\n\t\t\twhich he took to repeat Christ's journey, and that the same time \r\n\t\t\twould be taken in traversing the average pavement labyrinth on the \r\n\t\t\tknees.The use of the labyrinth as a simile for the Christian's life \r\n\t\t\tis shown in a stone inscription in the Museum at Lyons: \n(1)\n\n \n\nChartres, \r\n\t\t\tFrance: \nThere have been at \r\n\t\t\tleast five cathedrals on this site, each replacing an earlier \r\n\t\t\tsmaller building that had been destroyed by war or fire. It was \r\n\t\t\tcalled the 'Church of Saint Mary' in the eighth century.\nOne of the best \r\n\t\t\t\tknown examples of Cathedral Labyrinths is found at Chartres, in \r\n\t\t\t\trance: As well as the huge 11-circuit labyrinth on the floor, \r\n\t\t\tthe cathedral has a spectacular rose window over the great west \r\n\t\t\tdoors. This has the same dimensions as the labyrinth and is exactly \r\n\t\t\tthe same distance up the west wall as the labyrinth is laterally \r\n\t\t\tfrom the cathedral's main entrance below the window\nThe labyrinth at Chartres was known as a \"Chemin \r\n\t\t\tde Jérusalem\" \"daedale,\" or \"meandre,\" terms which \r\n\t\t\tneed no explanation. The centre was called \"ciel\" or \"Jérusalem.\" \r\n\t\t\t(1)\nWhen pilgrimage to \r\n\t\t\tthe Holy City of Jerusalem was made difficult and dangerous by the \r\n\t\t\tCrusades. The Church designated seven European cathedrals, mainly in \r\n\t\t\tFrance, to become Jerusalem for pilgrims. The labyrinth became the \r\n\t\t\tfinal stage of pilgrimage, serving as a symbolic entry into the \r\n\t\t\tCelestial City of Jerusalem. All seven cathedrals used the \r\n\t\t\t11-circuit labyrinth design. \r\n\t\t\t(3)\n \n \n\n\nOther Examples \r\n\t\t\t\t\tof Labyrinths from around the Ancient World.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it is \r\n\t\t\t\tdifficult to date exactly, this (Neolithic - Early Bronze-age) \r\n\t\t\t\tlabyrinth comes from Val Camonica, in Italy.

The age of this \r\n\t\t\t\tlabyrinth is the subject of considerable dispute amongst experts \r\n\t\t\t\ton Indian rock art, but it could date to the Neolithic period, \r\n\t\t\t\tmaybe c. 2,500 B.C. which would make it as old, if not older, than \r\n\t\t\t\tsimilar early labyrinth petroglyphs in Europe. Several examples \r\n\t\t\t\tof the labyrinth symbol have also been found amongst cave art in \r\n\t\t\t\tthe north of India. One example at Tikla, in Madhya Pradesh, has \r\n\t\t\t\tbeen dated to approximately 250 B.C., although doubt remains as \r\n\t\t\t\tto whether the labyrinth is contemporary with other more \r\n\t\t\t\tdateable figures (Kern, 2000). \n(2)\n(Prehistoric \r\n\t\t\t\tIndia)\n \n\n \n(Knossos, \r\n\t\t\tGreece)     (The \r\n\t\t\t'Lost' Labyrinth, Egypt)\n(Spirals)\n(Sacred \r\n\t\t\tGeometry)\n(Altered \r\n\t\t\tLandscapes)(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\r\n  \r\n \n \r\n   \r\n   \n\r\n\t\t\tLabyrinths:\n\nThe word 'Labyrinth' is a pre-Greek word \r\n\t\t\t\t(Minoan). There is a hidden irony in the current definition and \r\n\t\t\t\tthe original myth of Theseus and the Minotaur's lair, within which one \r\n\t\t\t\tcould get lost in forever. Unlike a maze, which refers to a complex branching puzzle with \r\n\t\t\t\tchoices of path and direction; the 'classic'  labyrinth \r\n\t\t\t\tdesign has only a single, non-branching path, which \r\n\t\t\t\tleads to the centre. A labyrinth in this sense has a single, \r\n\t\t\t\tunambiguous route to the centre and back and is not designed to \r\n\t\t\t\tbe difficult to navigate, so Theseus would have had little need \r\n\t\t\t\tfor Ariadne's thread.\nWe do not know \r\n\t\t\t\twhen the labyrinth structure first was conceived, but \r\n\t\t\t\tthere are several incidences among the ideograms carved into rock faces across \r\n\t\t\t\tNeolithic and 'Bronze-age' Europe. We see the ideogram later on \r\n\t\t\t\tan Etruscan vase from c. 550 B.C. Later, at about 300 B.C., it was used on coins in Crete. \r\n\t\t\t\tDuring the middle-ages, it was used in European Cathedrals for \r\n\t\t\t\tpilgrimage.  \n\n\r\n\t\t\t \nThe Labyrinth as a Spiritual \r\n\t\t\tTool.\n\nA labyrinth is an \r\n\t\t\t\tarchetype with which we can have a direct experience. We can \r\n\t\t\t\twalk it. It is a metaphor for life's journey. It is a symbol \r\n\t\t\t\tthat creates a sacred space which leads us into its heart, then \r\n\t\t\t\tback out again along the same path. Although one is able to \r\n\t\t\t\tcross the lines at any time, we are compelled to follow the \r\n\t\t\t\tmeandering path to the centre and back again. \nThe Labyrinth \r\n\t\t\t\trepresents both a journey to our own centre and back out again \r\n\t\t\t\tinto the world... at the same time as acting as a metaphor for \r\n\t\t\t\tthe path we walk throughout our lives. \nThere is no \r\n\t\t\t\tgetting lost in a Labyrinth. Rather, one is offered a path that \r\n\t\t\t\tweaves back and forth, in and out, until it ends in a central \r\n\t\t\t\tcircular area. Here, walkers pause to reflect before departing \r\n\t\t\t\tas they came, carrying back wisdom gained on the inbound \r\n\t\t\t\tjourney. Labyrinth walkers say the certitude of the pathknowing \r\n\t\t\t\tall decisions about direction have been madefrees them to focus \r\n\t\t\t\ton contemplation instead of navigation. Some call this prayer; \r\n\t\t\t\tothers, deep reflection. Whatever the name, the practice has \r\n\t\t\t\tbeen used to nourish the soul around the world for several \r\n\t\t\t\tthousand of years. \nThe Labyrinth \r\n\t\t\t\tis a powerful geometric symbol with which we have formed an \r\n\t\t\t\talmost symbiotic relationship, which allows us to enter within \r\n\t\t\t\tits physical form at the same time as entering into a \r\n\t\t\t\tnon-physical communication with ourselves.\nBecause they \r\n\t\t\t\tare so ancient, the various interpretations of the Labyrinth \r\n\t\t\t\ttoday may not agree with the same concept of the labyrinths in \r\n\t\t\t\tancient times. It is curious then that the same identical symbol \r\n\t\t\t\tis found in countries and major religious traditions from around \r\n\t\t\t\tthe ancient world (such as India, France, Egypt, Scandinavia, \r\n\t\t\t\tCrete, Sumeria, America, the British Isles, and Italy), and that \r\n\t\t\t\tin all cases, they share a common theme of pilgrimage and \r\n\t\t\t\tspiritual reward. This has led some claim they represent a \r\n\t\t\t\tuniversal pattern in human consciousness.\n\r\n \n\n\n \nThe Geometry of the 'classic' \r\n\t\t\t\t7-circuit Labyrinth\n\n\nAll 'classic' labyrinths are based on a simple \r\n\t\t\t\tgeometric template. \nThe ancient \r\n\t\t\t\tseven-circuit labyrinth (so called because the path creates \r\n\t\t\t\tseven concentric rings around the centre) is rich with \r\n\t\t\t\tsymbolism. It draws on the mystical quality of the 7, a number \r\n\t\t\t\tof transformation and vision. In medieval times, the seven \r\n\t\t\t\tcircuits were seen to correspond to the seven visible planets, \r\n\t\t\t\tand a walk in the labyrinth was a cosmic journey through the \r\n\t\t\t\theavens. The seven circuits can also be seen to represent the \r\n\t\t\t\tdays of the week, the chakras, colours, or musical tones. \n\nSome research \r\n\t\t\t\tsuggests that the geometric shape [of a labyrinth] produces an \r\n\t\t\t\tenergy field that can heal ailments of the body and calm the \r\n\t\t\t\tmind. It balances thoughts with the presence of the body to the \r\n\t\t\t\tpoint where one stops thinking and the intuition of knowingness \r\n\t\t\t\ttakes over (4)\n\n\r\n\t\t\t \n\r\n\t\t\t \n \nProto Labyrinths..? \n\nPrehistoric \r\n\t\t\tlabyrinths have also been found carved on rock faces at Pontevedra, \r\n\t\t\tSpain and at Val Camonica in northern Italy, these latter ones are \r\n\t\t\tattributed to the late Bronze Age. The Rocky Valley labyrinths in \r\n\t\t\tCornwall, England, are supposed to be from the Bronze Age. The \r\n\t\t\tlabyrinth is found etched into the sands of the Nazca Plain in Peru, \r\n\t\t\tin use among the Caduveo people of Brazil and scratched on boulders \r\n\t\t\tand rockfaces in Northern Mexico, New Mexico and Arizona. \nIt is suggested \r\n\t\t\tthat the Labyrinth evolved from the spiral.\n\r\n\t\t\t  \r\n\t\t\t\nAchnabreck, \r\n\t\t\tScotland (left), and Knowth, Ireland \r\n\t\t\t(Right).\n \n\nThe Glastonbury Labyrinth:\nIt is proposed that the strong \r\n\t\t\t\tterracing on the sides of the Tor represent a classic '7-circuit \r\n\t\t\tlabyrinth' in three dimensional form. \n\n\n\n\nThe Tor is a natural \r\n\t\t\thill, but it has been established that it was altered in shape from \r\n\t\t\tthe late Neolithic onwards. Whether or not the terraces were cut to \r\n\t\t\treplicate the 'classic' Labyrinth shape is still conjectural but the \r\n\t\t\tlocation, and the tor's reputation as the 'Sacred Heart of England' \r\n\t\t\tmakes it possible that the terraces were the final part of a pilgrim \r\n\t\t\troute. \n (More \r\n\t\t\tabout Glastonbury Tor)\n \nThe 'Lost' \r\n\t\t\t\tLabyrinth of Egypt.\n\n\nHerodotus (c. \r\n\t\t\t484-424 BC) describes his visit to the now 'lost' labyrinth after \r\n\t\t\tdescribing how the Egyptians divided the land into twelve parts, or\r\n\t\t\tnomes, and set a king over each, he says that they agreed to \r\n\t\t\tcombine together to leave a memorial of themselves. They constructed \r\n\t\t\tthe Labyrinth, just above Lake Moeris, and nearly opposite the city \r\n\t\t\tof crocodiles (Crocodilopolis). \"I found it,\" he says, \"greater than \r\n\t\t\twords could tell, for, although the temple at Ephesus and that at \r\n\t\t\tSamos are celebrated works, yet all of the works and buildings of \r\n\t\t\tthe Greeks put together would certainly be inferior to this \r\n\t\t\tlabyrinth as regards labour and expense.\" Even the pyramids, he \r\n\t\t\ttells us, were surpassed by the Labyrinth. \"It has twelve covered \r\n\t\t\tcourts, with opposite doors, six courts on the North side and six on \r\n\t\t\tthe South, all communicating with one another and with one wall \r\n\t\t\tsurrounding them all. There are two sorts of rooms, one sort above, \r\n\t\t\tthe other sort below ground, fifteen hundred of each sort, or three \r\n\t\t\tthousand in all.\" He says that he was allowed to pass through the \r\n\t\t\tupper rooms only, the lower range being strictly guarded from \r\n\t\t\tvisitors, as they contained the tombs of the kings who had built the \r\n\t\t\tLabyrinth, also the tombs of the sacred crocodiles. The upper rooms \r\n\t\t\the describes as being of super-human size, and the system of \r\n\t\t\tpassages through the courts, rooms, and colonnades very intricate \r\n\t\t\tand bewildering. The roof of the whole affair, he says, is of stone \r\n\t\t\tand the walls are covered with carvings. Each of the courts is \r\n\t\t\tsurrounded by columns of white stone, perfectly joined. Outside the \r\n\t\t\tLabyrinth, and at one corner of it, is a pyramid about 240 feet in \r\n\t\t\theight, with huge figures carved upon it and approached by an \r\n\t\t\tunderground passage.\nStrabo, who lived \r\n\t\t\tabout 400 years after Herodotus also described them first hand. \r\n\t\t\tAfter referring to the lake and the manner in which it is used as a \r\n\t\t\tstorage reservoir for the water of the Nile, he proceeds to describe \r\n\t\t\tthe Labyrinth, \"a work equal to the Pyramids.\" He says it is \"a \r\n\t\t\tlarge palace composed of as many palaces as there were formerly \r\n\t\t\tnomes. There are an equal number of courts, surrounded by \r\n\t\t\tcolumns and adjoining one another, all in a row and constituting one \r\n\t\t\tbuilding, like a long wall with the courts in front of it. The \r\n\t\t\tentrances to the courts are opposite the wall; in front of these \r\n\t\t\tentrances are many long covered alleys with winding \r\n\t\t\tintercommunicating passages, so that a stranger could not find his \r\n\t\t\tway in or out unless with a guide. Each of these structures is \r\n\t\t\troofed with a single slab of stone, as are also the covered alleys, \r\n\t\t\tno timber or any other material being used.\" If one ascends to the \r\n\t\t\troof, he says, one looks over \"a field of stone.\" The courts were in \r\n\t\t\ta line, supported by a row of twenty-seven monolithic columns, the \r\n\t\t\twalls also being constructed of stones of as great a size. \"At the \r\n\t\t\tend of the building is the royal tomb, consisting of a square \r\n\t\t\tpyramid and containing the body of Imandes.\" Strabo says that \r\n\t\t\tit was the custom of the twelve nomes of Egypt to assemble, with \r\n\t\t\ttheir priests and priestesses, each nome in its own court, \r\n\t\t\tfor the purpose of sacrificing to the gods and administering justice \r\n\t\t\tin important matters.\n(More \r\n\t\t\tabout the 'Lost' Labyrinth of Egypt)\n \nThe Minoan Labyrinth, \r\n\t\t\tCrete:\n\nIn Greek \r\n\t\t\t\tmythology, the Labyrinth was an elaborate structure designed and \r\n\t\t\t\tbuilt by the legendary craftsman Daedalus for King Minos of \r\n\t\t\t\tCrete at Knossos to conceal the Minotaur.\n'At that \r\n\t\t\t\ttime there reigned at Knossos, in Crete, a monarch called Minos, \r\n\t\t\t\twho held sway over what was then the most powerful maritime \r\n\t\t\t\tstate in the Mediterranean. Minos had a son named Androgeos, \r\n\t\t\t\twho, during his travels in Attica, was treacherously set upon \r\n\t\t\t\tand slain, or so his father was informed. In consequence of this \r\n\t\t\t\tMinos imposed a penalty on the Athenians in the form of a \r\n\t\t\t\ttribute to be paid once every nine years, such tribute to \r\n\t\t\t\tconsist of seven youths and seven maidens, who were to be \r\n\t\t\t\tshipped to Knossos at the appointed periods.\nThere was at \r\n\t\t\t\tthe court of Minos an exceedingly clever and renowned artificer \r\n\t\t\t\tor engineer, Daedalus by name, to whom all sorts of miraculous \r\n\t\t\t\tinventions are ascribed. This Daedalus had devised an ingenious \r\n\t\t\t\tstructure, the \"Labyrinth,\" so contrived that if anybody were \r\n\t\t\t\tplaced therein he would find it practically impossible to \r\n\t\t\t\tdiscover the exit without a guide.\nThe \r\n\t\t\t\tLabyrinth was designed as a dwelling for, or at any rate was \r\n\t\t\t\tinhabited by, a hideous and cruel being called the Minotaur, a \r\n\t\t\t\tmonstrous offspring of Queen Pasiphaë, wife of Minos. The \r\n\t\t\t\tMinotaur is described as being half man and half bull, or a man \r\n\t\t\t\twith a bull's head, a ferocious creature that destroyed any \r\n\t\t\t\tunfortunate human beings who might come within its power. \r\n\t\t\t\tAccording to report, the youths and maidens of the Athenian \r\n\t\t\t\ttribute were periodically, one by one, thrust into the \r\n\t\t\t\tLabyrinth, where, after futile wanderings in the endeavour to \r\n\t\t\t\tfind an exit, they were finally caught and slain by the \r\n\t\t\t\tMinotaur'. (1)\n\nThere are many \r\n\t\t\tversions of the legend, some of them greatly at variance with \r\n\t\t\tothers. For instance, Philochorus, an eminent writer on the \r\n\t\t\tantiquities of Athens, gives in his \"Atthis\" a very rationalistic \r\n\t\t\taccount of the affair, stating that the Labyrinth was nothing but a \r\n\t\t\tdungeon where Minos imprisoned the Athenian youths until such time \r\n\t\t\tas they were given as prizes to the victors in the sports that were \r\n\t\t\theld in honour of his murdered son. He held also that the monster \r\n\t\t\twas simply a military officer, whose brutal disposition, in \r\n\t\t\tconjunction with his name, Tauros, may have given rise to the \r\n\t\t\tMinotaur myth.\n\n\n\nThese 5th - 3rd \r\n\t\t\t\tcentury BC coins from Knossos were struck with the labyrinth \r\n\t\t\t\tsymbol. The predominant labyrinth form during this period is the \r\n\t\t\t\tsimple 7-circuit style known as the classical labyrinth. \n\n\n(More \r\n\t\t\tabout Knossos, Crete)\n \nThe Nazca Labyrinth:\n\n\n</body>\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA five-year \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstudy by British archaeologists has shed new \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlight on the enigmatic drawings created by \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Nazca people between 100 BC and CE 700 \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin the Peruvian desert.

At \r\n\t\t\tthe centre is a jeu-de-lettres on the words SANCTA ECLESIA, \r\n\t\t\twhich may be read in any direction, except diagonally, commencing at \r\n\t\t\tthe centre. But for the employment of these words the labyrinth in \r\n\t\t\tquestion might well have been conceived to be a Roman relic utilised \r\n\t\t\tby the builders of the church to ornament their pavement. Such \r\n\t\t\tpavement-labyrinths, however, with or without central figures or \r\n\t\t\tother embellishments, and of various dimensions and composition, are \r\n\t\t\tfound in many of the old churches of France and Italy.\n\n\nAs to the function \r\n\t\t\tand meaning of the old church labyrinths, various opinions have been \r\n\t\t\theld. Some authorities have thought that they were merely introduced \r\n\t\t\tas a symbol of the perplexities and intricacies which beset the \r\n\t\t\tChristian's path. Others considered them to typify the entangling \r\n\t\t\tnature of sin or of any deviation from the rectilinear path of \r\n\t\t\tChristian duty. It has often been asserted, though on what evidence \r\n\t\t\tis not clear, that the larger examples were used for the performance \r\n\t\t\tof miniature pilgrimages in substitution for the long and tedious \r\n\t\t\tjourneys formerly laid upon penitents. Some colour is lent to this \r\n\t\t\tsupposition by the name \"Chemin de Jérusalem.\" at Chartres (see \r\n\t\t\tbelow). In the days of the first crusades it was a common practice \r\n\t\t\tfor the confessor to send the peccant members of his flock either to \r\n\t\t\tfight against the infidel, or, after the victory of Geoffrey of \r\n\t\t\tBouillon, to visit the Holy Sepulchre. As enthusiasm for the \r\n\t\t\tcrusades declined, shorter pilgrimages were substituted, usually to \r\n\t\t\tthe shrine of some saint, such as Our Lady of Loretto, or St. Thomas \r\n\t\t\tof Canterbury, and it is quite possible that, at a time when the \r\n\t\t\tsoul had passed out of the crusades and the Church's authority was \r\n\t\t\ton the ebb, a journey on the knees around the labyrinth's \r\n\t\t\tsinuosity's was prescribed as an alternative to these pilgrimages. \r\n\t\t\tPerhaps this type of penance was from the first imposed on those \r\n\t\t\twho, through weakness or any other reason, were unable to undertake \r\n\t\t\tlong travels.\nThis view seems to \r\n\t\t\trest chiefly on a statement by J. B. F. Géruzez in his \"Description \r\n\t\t\tof the City of Rheims\" (1817), to the effect that the labyrinth \r\n\t\t\twhich formerly lay in the cathedral was in origin an object of \r\n\t\t\tdevotion, being the emblem of the interior of the Temple of \r\n\t\t\tJerusalem, but Géruzez quotes no authority for his assertion. \r\n\t\t\tAnother explanation, based upon the occurrence of the figures of the \r\n\t\t\tarchitects or founders in certain of the designs, is that the \r\n\t\t\tlabyrinth was a sort of masonic seal, signifying that the pious aim \r\n\t\t\tof the builder had been to raise to the glory of God a structure to \r\n\t\t\tvie with the splendours of the traditional Labyrinth. It is also \r\n\t\t\tsaid that in some cases the \"Chemins\" were used for processional \r\n\t\t\tpurposes.\nSome writers have \r\n\t\t\theld that the labyrinth was inserted in the church as typifying the \r\n\t\t\tChristian's life or the devious course of those who yield to \r\n\t\t\ttemptation. Some have thought that it represented the path from the \r\n\t\t\thouse of Pilate to Calvary, pointing out that Chateaubriand, in his \r\n\t\t\t\"Itinéraire de Paris à Jérusalem,\" mentioned two hours as the period \r\n\t\t\twhich he took to repeat Christ's journey, and that the same time \r\n\t\t\twould be taken in traversing the average pavement labyrinth on the \r\n\t\t\tknees.The use of the labyrinth as a simile for the Christian's life \r\n\t\t\tis shown in a stone inscription in the Museum at Lyons: \n(1)\n\n \n\nChartres, \r\n\t\t\tFrance: \nThere have been at \r\n\t\t\tleast five cathedrals on this site, each replacing an earlier \r\n\t\t\tsmaller building that had been destroyed by war or fire. It was \r\n\t\t\tcalled the 'Church of Saint Mary' in the eighth century.\nOne of the best \r\n\t\t\t\tknown examples of Cathedral Labyrinths is found at Chartres, in \r\n\t\t\t\trance: As well as the huge 11-circuit labyrinth on the floor, \r\n\t\t\tthe cathedral has a spectacular rose window over the great west \r\n\t\t\tdoors. This has the same dimensions as the labyrinth and is exactly \r\n\t\t\tthe same distance up the west wall as the labyrinth is laterally \r\n\t\t\tfrom the cathedral's main entrance below the window\nThe labyrinth at Chartres was known as a \"Chemin \r\n\t\t\tde Jérusalem\" \"daedale,\" or \"meandre,\" terms which \r\n\t\t\tneed no explanation. The centre was called \"ciel\" or \"Jérusalem.\" \r\n\t\t\t(1)\nWhen pilgrimage to \r\n\t\t\tthe Holy City of Jerusalem was made difficult and dangerous by the \r\n\t\t\tCrusades. The Church designated seven European cathedrals, mainly in \r\n\t\t\tFrance, to become Jerusalem for pilgrims. The labyrinth became the \r\n\t\t\tfinal stage of pilgrimage, serving as a symbolic entry into the \r\n\t\t\tCelestial City of Jerusalem. All seven cathedrals used the \r\n\t\t\t11-circuit labyrinth design. \r\n\t\t\t(3)\n \n \n\n\nOther Examples \r\n\t\t\t\t\tof Labyrinths from around the Ancient World.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it is \r\n\t\t\t\tdifficult to date exactly, this (Neolithic - Early Bronze-age) \r\n\t\t\t\tlabyrinth comes from Val Camonica, in Italy. The Val Camonica \r\n\t\t\t\tvalley has revealed over 300,000 petroglyphs of which this is \r\n\t\t\t\tjust one. It is one of the richest sources of rock-art in all \r\n\t\t\t\tEurope.\n(More \r\n\t\t\t\tabout Val Camonica, Italy)\n\n\n \n \nReverse of a \r\n\t\t\t\tclay tablet from Pylos bearing the motif of the Labyrinth. The \r\n\t\t\t\ttablet, the earliest datable representation of the 7-course \r\n\t\t\t\tclassical labyrinth, was recovered from the remains of the \r\n\t\t\t\tMycenaean palace of Pylos, destroyed by fire ca 1,200 B.C. (Kern,\r\n\t\t\t\tThrough the Labyrinth, Prestel, 2000, p. 73, catalog item \r\n\t\t\t\t103104). \n(More \r\n\t\t\t\tabout Mycenae, Greece)\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\nThis classic \r\n\t\t\t\t'3-circuit labyrinth' is one of the many intricate geoglyphs, \r\n\t\t\t\tor patterns created on the plains northwest of Nazca, Peru, \r\n\t\t\tby the indigenous peoples there, sometime between 200 B.C. and 700 \r\n\t\t\t\tA.D. Native Americans had them, and continue to be used in the \r\n\t\t\t\tsacred ceremonies of the Hopi. The Hopi Indians called the \r\n\t\t\t\tlabyrinth the symbol for mother earth and equated it with the \r\n\t\t\t\tKiva (called it Tapu'at, or Mother-child.)\n\n(More \r\n\t\t\t\t\tabout Nazca, Peru)      \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\nThis Etruscan \r\n\t\t\t\tVase (c. 550 B.C.) came from Tragliatelli, Italy, with labyrinth \r\n\t\t\t\tdesign and three horse-back warriors riding away from it.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nCurrently the earliest evidence \r\n\t\t\t\tfor the labyrinth in Asia is probably a labyrinth carved amongst \r\n\t\t\t\tother prehistoric petroglyphs, recently discovered on a \r\n\t\t\t\triverbank at Pansaimol in Goa (Kraft, 2005). The age of this \r\n\t\t\t\tlabyrinth is the subject of considerable dispute amongst experts \r\n\t\t\t\ton Indian rock art, but it could date to the Neolithic period, \r\n\t\t\t\tmaybe c. 2,500 B.C. which would make it as old, if not older, than \r\n\t\t\t\tsimilar early labyrinth petroglyphs in Europe. Several examples \r\n\t\t\t\tof the labyrinth symbol have also been found amongst cave art in \r\n\t\t\t\tthe north of India. One example at Tikla, in Madhya Pradesh, has \r\n\t\t\t\tbeen dated to approximately 250 B.C., although doubt remains as \r\n\t\t\t\tto whether the labyrinth is contemporary with other more \r\n\t\t\t\tdateable figures (Kern, 2000). \n(2)\n(Prehistoric \r\n\t\t\t\tIndia)\n \n\n \n(Knossos, \r\n\t\t\tGreece)     (The \r\n\t\t\t'Lost' Labyrinth, Egypt)\n(Spirals)\n(Sacred \r\n\t\t\tGeometry)\n(Altered \r\n\t\t\tLandscapes)References:\n1).

Отличие от этой (версия неизвестна) раздачи: более новая версия\n\n\nОтличия версии 4.5.0 от версии 4.0.0\n* All old labyrinth levels are saved so we can walk up the stairs (But we get the experience gain and the benefits from our skills only once!)\n* The players can be in different levels\n* Summoned creatures act like players. Means they have a movement rating and can really accompany their caster.\n* The inventory works \"Diablo\" like means we can rearrange our items with the mouse and stack them into piles. We can also drag&drop them to the character skeleton to use them.\n* We have a belt that works like a quickaccess inventory. We can move up to 10 items in there and access them in the mainscreen by clicking on them or pressing F1-F10\n* The stairs can be in all 4 corners\n\n\nскриншоты\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\nDownload\n\n\nСкачать раздачу по magnet-ссылке\n\t\t\t\t\t · 15.7 MB\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tДля скачивания .torrent файлов необходима\n\t\t\t\t\t\tрегистрация\n\n\nКак скачивать  ·  Что такое torrent (торрент)\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tСайт не распространяет и не хранит электронные версии произведений, а лишь предоставляет доступ к создаваемому\n\t\t\t\t\tпользователями каталогу ссылок на торрент-файлы,\n\t\t\t\t\tкоторые содержат только списки хеш-сумм\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС] \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nМира\n  Стаж: 10 лет 5 месяцев Сообщений: 23738\n\n\n\n\n\nМира · \n\n03-Мар-11 01:46\n\n(спустя 1 день 16 часов)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tОписание должно быть на русском языке.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС] \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay-Elven\nСтаж: 9 лет 2 месяца Сообщений: 75\n \n\n\n\n\nDay-Elven · \n\n04-Мар-11 15:04\n\n(спустя 1 день 13 часов)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tИз комнаты с неизвестным содержимым (знаками вопроса) иногда закидывает к королю мёртвых или дракону. Король мёртвых - слабый, а вот дракон...\nКогда попадаешь к дракону, пишут что-то типа (точную цитату не помню) \"Вы свалились в логово свирепого дракона. Это Ваш конец.\" Персонаж оказывается в комнате с одним открытым сундуком (по-моему, золотым) с достаточно неплохим предметом - который можно схватить, не теряя хода, при способности swift fingers - мне попадались броня / кольцо / амулет) и драконом.\nКто-нибудь убивал дракона?\nОн наносит 10-15 урона и я промахиваюсь по нему с вероятностью ~80%\nВ принципе, существует спец. оружие - dragon slayer - +7 к атаке / урону против драконов, но оно, во-первых, дорого стоит; во-вторых, далеко не всегда можно встретить торговца, который его продаёт; в-третьих, даже если встретишь торговца и хватит денег, нет никакой гарантии, что оно пригодится; и, в-четвёртых, не факт, что поможет - при такой разнице в силе.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС] \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlandout\n Стаж: 9 лет 8 месяцев Сообщений: 566\n\n\n\n\n\nlandout · \n\n05-Мар-11 01:52\n\n(спустя 10 часов)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tИгра очень несбалансирована - выгоднее всего быть лучником.

См. топ игроков - все используют разные сеты способностей. Я играю за воина и при текущих скиллах набирал до 70 ХП и до 30-40 урона на каждую цель. В среднем набираю по 150-200 пойнтов (лучший результат 328 пока что). В ближнем бою урон намного выше и можно атаковать сразу много целей.\nХП всегда хватает - трудно играть становится только на 10 уровне подземелья и ниже, когда у монстров появляются заклинания на создание массовых полей яда и огня. Так что я, как правило, погибаю от яда или если не повезёт с комнатой с вопросиками.P.S. Ещё на спец уровне с пауками есть монстр со зверским отравлением, и по нему попасть трудно (хотя остальные монстры там слабые).\nА на спец уровне \"Swarm of Loneliness\" поля с ядом...\nКогда начинал играть, брал способность уязвимости к яду, а сейчас подумываю, не взять ли мне сопротивление от яда )\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС] \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlandout\n Стаж: 9 лет 8 месяцев Сообщений: 566\n\n\n\n\n\nlandout · \n\n05-Мар-11 15:21\n\n(спустя 2 часа 35 мин.)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tЯ попробовал играть командой из 4х человек.

На этом же уровне лучником зарубил монстра-сундук, понадобилось несколько ударов и немного зелий.\nВ целом, учитывая, что все зависит не столько от способностей перса, сколько от рандома, то могли бы уже и автосохранение приделать в игру\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС] \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay-Elven\nСтаж: 9 лет 2 месяца Сообщений: 75\n \n\n\n\n\nDay-Elven · \n\n05-Мар-11 17:00\n\n(спустя 1 час 39 мин., ред. 05-Мар-11 17:00)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tМонстр-сундук - это Mimic.\nДа, рандом может сильно помочь или навредить, но я думаю, что способности имеют куда большее значение. Я сейчас нашёл более-менее оптимальный набор способностей и до 10го уровня никогда больше не умираю, как раньше. Максимум доходил до 16го - когда меня закинуло в спец уровень, гробницу с костяными драконами и прочей нечистью. Я убивал их с одного удара, но их было много и они стреляли магией.\nЯ не пробовал играть несколькими одновременно. Думаю, если разумно распределить способности, то несколькими персонажами будет играть легче. Хотя бы потому, что маг может создавать еду и воду на всю группу, а также лечить. Может, даже есть какое-то заклинание для снятия яда (по крайней мере, я встречал зелье с таким эффектом).

См. топ игроков - все используют разные сеты способностей. Я играю за воина и при текущих скиллах набирал до 70 ХП и до 30-40 урона на каждую цель. В среднем набираю по 150-200 пойнтов (лучший результат 328 пока что). В ближнем бою урон намного выше и можно атаковать сразу много целей.\nХП всегда хватает - трудно играть становится только на 10 уровне подземелья и ниже, когда у монстров появляются заклинания на создание массовых полей яда и огня. Так что я, как правило, погибаю от яда или если не повезёт с комнатой с вопросиками.P.S. Ещё на спец уровне с пауками есть монстр со зверским отравлением, и по нему попасть трудно (хотя остальные монстры там слабые).\nА на спец уровне \"Swarm of Loneliness\" поля с ядом...\nКогда начинал играть, брал способность уязвимости к яду, а сейчас подумываю, не взять ли мне сопротивление от яда )[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС]landout\n Стаж: 9 лет 8 месяцев Сообщений: 566landout · \n\n05-Мар-11 15:21\n\n(спустя 2 часа 35 мин.)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tЯ попробовал играть командой из 4х человек.

Я сейчас нашёл более-менее оптимальный набор способностей и до 10го уровня никогда больше не умираю, как раньше. Максимум доходил до 16го - когда меня закинуло в спец уровень, гробницу с костяными драконами и прочей нечистью. Я убивал их с одного удара, но их было много и они стреляли магией.\nЯ не пробовал играть несколькими одновременно. Думаю, если разумно распределить способности, то несколькими персонажами будет играть легче. Хотя бы потому, что маг может создавать еду и воду на всю группу, а также лечить. Может, даже есть какое-то заклинание для снятия яда (по крайней мере, я встречал зелье с таким эффектом). А также продвижение будет быстрее и безопаснее, если в команде будет персонаж, который имеет скилл открывания дверей и хорошие навыки обнаружения ловушек.[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС]Dr.Kocks\nСтаж: 9 лет 3 месяца Сообщений: 7Dr.Kocks · \n\n13-Мар-11 15:47\n\n(спустя 7 дней, ред. 13-Мар-11 15:47)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tа можно ссылочку для linux...\nа то под wine тупит при выборе количества игроков?\nуже на надо - сам нашёл[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС]WWIII_08\n Стаж: 9 лет 11 месяцев Сообщений: 1875WWIII_08 · \n\n25-Апр-11 16:19\n\n(спустя 1 месяц 12 дней)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tКто любит rogue - качайте также Elona, это тоже вещь, must play.[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС]zodiakoff\n Стаж: 8 лет 2 месяца Сообщений: 1526zodiakoff · \n\n25-Апр-11 18:01\n\n(спустя 1 час 42 мин.)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nDay-Elven писал(а):\nОбновлено до версии 4.6.0\n\nдобавьте описание изменений[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС]Day-Elven\nСтаж: 9 лет 2 месяца Сообщений: 75Day-Elven · \n\n25-Апр-11 18:54\n\n(спустя 53 мин.)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nblack_revolution\nСписка изменений на официальном сайте нет.\nЯ не имею отношения к разработке игры, поэтому не знаю, что конкретно было изменено.\nВ основном это фиксы множества мелких багов.\nНо, думаю, не только, если учесть, что прошлая версия весила 10 Мб, а эта весит 16 Мб.[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС]WWIII_08\n Стаж: 9 лет 11 месяцев Сообщений: 1875WWIII_08 · \n\n17-Июн-11 23:52\n\n(спустя 1 месяц 22 дня)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tКто любит такие олдскул игрушки, качайте Elona, Inaria, Rogue Survivor, Knights Of The Chalice, Eschalon, Avadon, SpiderWed Software.[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС]Kerai\nСтаж: 9 лет 10 месяцев Сообщений: 68Kerai · \n\n22-Июн-11 14:13\n\n(спустя 4 дня)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tЧто за прикол с закрытыми перками?[Профиль] \n\t\t\t[ЛС]korgant\n  Стаж: 10 лет 5 месяцев Сообщений: 2473korgant · \n\n07-Авг-11 12:34\n\n(спустя 1 месяц 14 дней)\n\n\n[Цитировать] \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nDay-Elven\n\nЦитата:\nПлатформа: Windows.

      "Strange Adventures In Infinite Space is a roguelike-like video game set in space. Strange Adventures In Infinite Space was created by the independent game development group Digital Eel and released for Windows and Mac on March 15, 2002 by boardgame developer-publisher, Cheapass Games. It was later released for Pocket PC and Palm by British developer-publisher Astraware.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nIn Strange Adventures In Infinite Space the game players explore a \"plausibly implausible\" fictional region of the Milky Way galaxy called The Purple Void.\nStrange Adventures In Infinite Space sets itself up differently each time it is played. Stars, black holes, planets, nebulae, artifacts, alien patrols, gadgets, lifeforms and dozens of events and encounters are randomized for each game session. Unlike conventional roguelikes, Strange Adventures In Infinite Space features graphics, music and sound, and game sessions typically last from 3 to 20 minutes, hence the game's tagline \"Explore the galaxy in 20 minutes or less!\"\n\n\n== Development ==\nStrange Adventures In Infinite Space was created by the independent game development group Digital Eel and released on March 15, 2002 by boardgame developer-publisher Cheapass Games.\n\n\n=== Open sourcing and freeware release ===\nAs of November 11, 2005, the source code is freely available under the GNU GPL, though without the other game content. Since September 28, 2009, Strange Adventures In Infinite Space was made available as freeware, including the game content. Due to the source code availability ports to alternative platforms emerged, for instance for the ARM and Linux based OpenPandora.Years later it was also released for Pocket PC and Palm by British developer/publisher, Astraware.\n\n\n=== Sequel ===\nStrange Adventures In Infinite Space's sequels, Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space (Windows, Mac, tablet; 2005) and Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars (Windows; 2014-2015), feature more content and options, and is available for Windows and Mac.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nErnest Adams, writing for Gamasutra in 2005, described Strange Adventures In Infinite Space as \"The perfect short game\".Strange Adventures In Infinite Space was a 2003 Independent Games Festival finalist.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of roguelikes\nWeird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nInfinite Space Games: Official umbrella site for all Digital Eel \"Infinite Space\" electronic and table games\nStrange Adventures in Infinite Space at MobyGames\nStrange Adventures in Infinite Space page at Paizo Publishing (CD version)\nAstraware (publisher of Pocket PC and Palm OS ports)",

      "Разработчики Strange Adventures in Infinite Space (SAIS) из\r\n      малоизвестной компании Digital Eel сами признаются, что их странный\r\n      приключенческий проект своим появлением на свет во многом обязан\r\n      плодотворному влиянию трудов Джина Родденберри, папы Star\r\n      Trek, а также Фреда Форда и Пола Рейха-третьего,\r\n      создателей великого Star Control 2. Вполне обычный набор —\r\n      творческим переосмыслением идей этих товарищей занимается множество\r\n      малоизвестных игродельческих компаний. А вот о приверженности третьей\r\n      личности, королю трэш-кино Эдварду Вуду (Plan 9 From Outer Space),\r\n      осмеливаются заявить немногие. В самом факте почитания, конечно, нет\r\n      ничего страшного — маэстро Лукас не так давно откровенно поведал,\r\n      что при создании второго эпизода своей киноэпопеи черпал вдохновение из\r\n      бездонного колодца идиотских космических фильмов 50-х. Но ему такие\r\n      заявления вполне простительны. За его спиной — многомиллионный бюджет и\r\n      сплоченный коллектив профи, который независимо от диковинных предпочтений\r\n      шефа выдаст первоклассный продукт. Наших же удальцов из\r\n      \"Цифрового угря\" финансировала компания с красноречивым названием\r\n      Cheapass Games, поэтому пресловутые картофелины-астероиды из игры так и\r\n      прут…На корабле, который более чем слегка напоминает стартрековый U.S.S.\r\n      Enterprise, игрок судорожно мотается от одного звездного тела к другому.\r\n      По прибытии на планету ему предоставляют некоторые сведения о ее\r\n      почвенно-климатических условиях и даруют какой-нибудь ценный сувенир. Это\r\n      может быть навешиваемая на хребет корабля побрякушка, что-то вроде\r\n      плазменного нитроускорителя с турбонаддувом; в некоторых случаях можно\r\n      стать счастливым обладателем колонии чрезвычайно сообразительных летающих\r\n      бегемотов, а иногда вместо сувенира на борт засылают саботера, который\r\n      отчленяет от корабля какую-нибудь подсистему, или же встречают\r\n      торжественной метеоритной бомбардировкой и вспышкой ближайшей сверхновой,\r\n — это уж как повезет.Кроме того, желающие могут нежданно-негаданно встретить похожих на\r\n      страусов торговцев расы Klakar и попробовать поменять воздушный шарик\r\n      органического происхождения на пятнадцатиметровый результат греховной\r\n      связи паука и летучей мыши. Но мирные инопланетяне — явление в\r\n      SAIS довольно редкое. Все-таки на большинстве планет балом правят\r\n      воинственные алики. С последними полагается биться в рамках отдельной\r\n      мини-игры — SC 2 в очередной раз улыбается нам платиновыми\r\n      коронками. В космических битвах по версии \"Цифрового Угря\" есть что-то от\r\n      рыцарских турниров. Подобно средневековым удальцам, в поединке вы почти\r\n      не допускаетесь к управлению своим средством передвижения — оно лишь на\r\n      всех парах движется навстречу антиподу. По мере сближения посудины\r\n      раскручивают оружейные системы и начинают самозабвенно поливать друг\r\n      друга разноцветными струйками лазеров; в это время камера пододвигается к\r\n      происходящему поближе, надеясь удивить зрителей эффектным батальным\r\n      ракурсом. Лучше бы она этого, честное слово, не делала. Так бы мы по\r\n      крайней мере не узнали, что модельки всех кораблей рисовались начинающим\r\n      сисадмином в каком-нибудь Deluxe Paint 1.84. То есть Эд Вуд,\r\n      натурально, в гробу не то что вертится, а вытворяет тройные тулупы с\r\n      переворотом.В определенный момент времени в сознании всякого уважающего себя игрока,\r\n      столкнувшегося с SAIS нос к носу (видимо, ему угрожали Particle\r\n      Vortex Cannon) всплывает такой вопрос: ЗАЧЕМ?! Выкорчевывая с планет\r\n      агрессивных алиенов и вступая в торговые отношения с миролюбивыми, мы не\r\n      испытываем ни малейшей моральной сатисфакции. Открывая планеты с райскими\r\n      условиями жизни, мы лишь недоуменно пожимаем плечами, ибо нам некого туда\r\n      заселять. Мы не извлекаем никакой пользы из богатых ресурсами спутников,\r\n      поскольку не можем развернуть на них добывающую промышленность. Игру\r\n      низводит в могилу именно патологическая недосказанность: такое\r\n      впечатление, будто разработчики не рассчитали свои возможности и\r\n      оказались не в состоянии сделать проект таким, каким он задумывался\r\n      изначально. В результате из него выпирает масса кусочков глобальной\r\n      стратегической игры, но они, увы, никак не связаны между собой.Чтобы хоть как-то свести их воедино, создателям пришлось выкручиваться\r\n      совсем уж невообразимым образом. Решив, что аркаду можно слепить из\r\n      любого <explicit content>, они ограничили время игры и ввели\r\n      систему набора очков. На все космоприключения отводится десяток лет,\r\n      которые вполне укладываются в десять минут нашего, земного, времени.

Вполне обычный набор —\r\n      творческим переосмыслением идей этих товарищей занимается множество\r\n      малоизвестных игродельческих компаний. А вот о приверженности третьей\r\n      личности, королю трэш-кино Эдварду Вуду (Plan 9 From Outer Space),\r\n      осмеливаются заявить немногие. В самом факте почитания, конечно, нет\r\n      ничего страшного — маэстро Лукас не так давно откровенно поведал,\r\n      что при создании второго эпизода своей киноэпопеи черпал вдохновение из\r\n      бездонного колодца идиотских космических фильмов 50-х. Но ему такие\r\n      заявления вполне простительны. За его спиной — многомиллионный бюджет и\r\n      сплоченный коллектив профи, который независимо от диковинных предпочтений\r\n      шефа выдаст первоклассный продукт. Наших же удальцов из\r\n      \"Цифрового угря\" финансировала компания с красноречивым названием\r\n      Cheapass Games, поэтому пресловутые картофелины-астероиды из игры так и\r\n      прут…\r\n    \r\n      Где-то внутри в каждом из нас/ Есть бесконечный космос\r\n    \n\n\nСистемные требования\n\nPentium II 350\n 32 Мб памяти\n\nРекомендуемые требования\n\nPentium III 600\n 64 Mб памяти\n\n\nSAIS, хоть и делалась по образу и подобию десятилетнего старичка\r\n      Star Control 2, уступает ему буквально по всем показателям. Взять\r\n      хотя бы масштаб происходящего. Прототип оперировал десятками солнечных\r\n      систем и сотнями планет, а лихие антиглобалисты из Digital Eel сумели\r\n      втиснуть провозглашенный в названии бесконечный космос в куцый, не\r\n      поддающийся масштабированию экранчик в фиксированном разрешении 640х480;\r\n      на нем разбросано около дюжины разноцветных точек-планет, а также\r\n      несколько туманностей и черных дыр, таящих немалые опасности для\r\n      начинающих космоприключенцев. Все это нехитрое хозяйство при каждой новой\r\n      игре размещается генератором случайных чисел в произвольном порядке, что\r\n      позволяет авторам рассуждать о стремящейся к бесконечности replayability.\r\n      Мужайтесь: разработчики вообще очень любят щеголять своим странноватым\r\n      чувством юмора. Например, тексты, описывающие всякие внутриигровые\r\n      явления, так и сочатся безумием. Я, кстати, не виноват, если что-нибудь\r\n      из нижесказанного покажется вам бредом. Вероятно, это результат\r\n      оплодотворения девелоперской фантазии нетленками Эда Вуда.\r\n    \r\n      На корабле, который более чем слегка напоминает стартрековый U.S.S.\r\n      Enterprise, игрок судорожно мотается от одного звездного тела к другому.\r\n      По прибытии на планету ему предоставляют некоторые сведения о ее\r\n      почвенно-климатических условиях и даруют какой-нибудь ценный сувенир. Это\r\n      может быть навешиваемая на хребет корабля побрякушка, что-то вроде\r\n      плазменного нитроускорителя с турбонаддувом; в некоторых случаях можно\r\n      стать счастливым обладателем колонии чрезвычайно сообразительных летающих\r\n      бегемотов, а иногда вместо сувенира на борт засылают саботера, который\r\n      отчленяет от корабля какую-нибудь подсистему, или же встречают\r\n      торжественной метеоритной бомбардировкой и вспышкой ближайшей сверхновой,\r\n — это уж как повезет.\r\n    \r\n      Кроме того, желающие могут нежданно-негаданно встретить похожих на\r\n      страусов торговцев расы Klakar и попробовать поменять воздушный шарик\r\n      органического происхождения на пятнадцатиметровый результат греховной\r\n      связи паука и летучей мыши. Но мирные инопланетяне — явление в\r\n      SAIS довольно редкое. Все-таки на большинстве планет балом правят\r\n      воинственные алики. С последними полагается биться в рамках отдельной\r\n      мини-игры — SC 2 в очередной раз улыбается нам платиновыми\r\n      коронками. В космических битвах по версии \"Цифрового Угря\" есть что-то от\r\n      рыцарских турниров. Подобно средневековым удальцам, в поединке вы почти\r\n      не допускаетесь к управлению своим средством передвижения — оно лишь на\r\n      всех парах движется навстречу антиподу. По мере сближения посудины\r\n      раскручивают оружейные системы и начинают самозабвенно поливать друг\r\n      друга разноцветными струйками лазеров; в это время камера пододвигается к\r\n      происходящему поближе, надеясь удивить зрителей эффектным батальным\r\n      ракурсом. Лучше бы она этого, честное слово, не делала. Так бы мы по\r\n      крайней мере не узнали, что модельки всех кораблей рисовались начинающим\r\n      сисадмином в каком-нибудь Deluxe Paint 1.84. То есть Эд Вуд,\r\n      натурально, в гробу не то что вертится, а вытворяет тройные тулупы с\r\n      переворотом.\r\n    \r\n      Парсек за пять сек\r\n    \n\r\n      В определенный момент времени в сознании всякого уважающего себя игрока,\r\n      столкнувшегося с SAIS нос к носу (видимо, ему угрожали Particle\r\n      Vortex Cannon) всплывает такой вопрос: ЗАЧЕМ?! Выкорчевывая с планет\r\n      агрессивных алиенов и вступая в торговые отношения с миролюбивыми, мы не\r\n      испытываем ни малейшей моральной сатисфакции. Открывая планеты с райскими\r\n      условиями жизни, мы лишь недоуменно пожимаем плечами, ибо нам некого туда\r\n      заселять. Мы не извлекаем никакой пользы из богатых ресурсами спутников,\r\n      поскольку не можем развернуть на них добывающую промышленность. Игру\r\n      низводит в могилу именно патологическая недосказанность: такое\r\n      впечатление, будто разработчики не рассчитали свои возможности и\r\n      оказались не в состоянии сделать проект таким, каким он задумывался\r\n      изначально. В результате из него выпирает масса кусочков глобальной\r\n      стратегической игры, но они, увы, никак не связаны между собой.\r\n    \r\n      Чтобы хоть как-то свести их воедино, создателям пришлось выкручиваться\r\n      совсем уж невообразимым образом. Решив, что аркаду можно слепить из\r\n      любого <explicit content>, они ограничили время игры и ввели\r\n      систему набора очков. На все космоприключения отводится десяток лет,\r\n      которые вполне укладываются в десять минут нашего, земного, времени. За\r\n      этот промежуток нужно открыть как можно больше планет, отмутузить как\r\n      можно больше злых обитателей космоса и под завязку набить грузовой отсек\r\n      псевдо-Энтерпрайза пчелами-пираньями, мед которых является мощнейшим\r\n      афродизиаком. Указанные деяния в итоге трансформируются в зачетные баллы.\r\n    \r\n      Действо заканчивается, опускается занавес с нацепленной на него табличкой\r\n      \"high scores\", всех тошнит от несвежих цифровых угрей…\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nРецензия актуальна для \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nСтатья обсуждается на нашем форуме,\nпользователи оставили уже 1 комментарий.Есть что сказать?

А вот о приверженности третьей\r\n      личности, королю трэш-кино Эдварду Вуду (Plan 9 From Outer Space),\r\n      осмеливаются заявить немногие. В самом факте почитания, конечно, нет\r\n      ничего страшного — маэстро Лукас не так давно откровенно поведал,\r\n      что при создании второго эпизода своей киноэпопеи черпал вдохновение из\r\n      бездонного колодца идиотских космических фильмов 50-х.

Взять\r\n      хотя бы масштаб происходящего. Прототип оперировал десятками солнечных\r\n      систем и сотнями планет, а лихие антиглобалисты из Digital Eel сумели\r\n      втиснуть провозглашенный в названии бесконечный космос в куцый, не\r\n      поддающийся масштабированию экранчик в фиксированном разрешении 640х480;\r\n      на нем разбросано около дюжины разноцветных точек-планет, а также\r\n      несколько туманностей и черных дыр, таящих немалые опасности для\r\n      начинающих космоприключенцев. Все это нехитрое хозяйство при каждой новой\r\n      игре размещается генератором случайных чисел в произвольном порядке, что\r\n      позволяет авторам рассуждать о стремящейся к бесконечности replayability.\r\n      Мужайтесь: разработчики вообще очень любят щеголять своим странноватым\r\n      чувством юмора. Например, тексты, описывающие всякие внутриигровые\r\n      явления, так и сочатся безумием. Я, кстати, не виноват, если что-нибудь\r\n      из нижесказанного покажется вам бредом. Вероятно, это результат\r\n      оплодотворения девелоперской фантазии нетленками Эда Вуда.\r\n    \r\n      На корабле, который более чем слегка напоминает стартрековый U.S.S.\r\n      Enterprise, игрок судорожно мотается от одного звездного тела к другому.\r\n      По прибытии на планету ему предоставляют некоторые сведения о ее\r\n      почвенно-климатических условиях и даруют какой-нибудь ценный сувенир. Это\r\n      может быть навешиваемая на хребет корабля побрякушка, что-то вроде\r\n      плазменного нитроускорителя с турбонаддувом; в некоторых случаях можно\r\n      стать счастливым обладателем колонии чрезвычайно сообразительных летающих\r\n      бегемотов, а иногда вместо сувенира на борт засылают саботера, который\r\n      отчленяет от корабля какую-нибудь подсистему, или же встречают\r\n      торжественной метеоритной бомбардировкой и вспышкой ближайшей сверхновой,\r\n — это уж как повезет.\r\n    \r\n      Кроме того, желающие могут нежданно-негаданно встретить похожих на\r\n      страусов торговцев расы Klakar и попробовать поменять воздушный шарик\r\n      органического происхождения на пятнадцатиметровый результат греховной\r\n      связи паука и летучей мыши. Но мирные инопланетяне — явление в\r\n      SAIS довольно редкое. Все-таки на большинстве планет балом правят\r\n      воинственные алики. С последними полагается биться в рамках отдельной\r\n      мини-игры — SC 2 в очередной раз улыбается нам платиновыми\r\n      коронками. В космических битвах по версии \"Цифрового Угря\" есть что-то от\r\n      рыцарских турниров. Подобно средневековым удальцам, в поединке вы почти\r\n      не допускаетесь к управлению своим средством передвижения — оно лишь на\r\n      всех парах движется навстречу антиподу. По мере сближения посудины\r\n      раскручивают оружейные системы и начинают самозабвенно поливать друг\r\n      друга разноцветными струйками лазеров; в это время камера пододвигается к\r\n      происходящему поближе, надеясь удивить зрителей эффектным батальным\r\n      ракурсом. Лучше бы она этого, честное слово, не делала. Так бы мы по\r\n      крайней мере не узнали, что модельки всех кораблей рисовались начинающим\r\n      сисадмином в каком-нибудь Deluxe Paint 1.84. То есть Эд Вуд,\r\n      натурально, в гробу не то что вертится, а вытворяет тройные тулупы с\r\n      переворотом.\r\n    \r\n      Парсек за пять сек\r\n    \n\r\n      В определенный момент времени в сознании всякого уважающего себя игрока,\r\n      столкнувшегося с SAIS нос к носу (видимо, ему угрожали Particle\r\n      Vortex Cannon) всплывает такой вопрос: ЗАЧЕМ?! Выкорчевывая с планет\r\n      агрессивных алиенов и вступая в торговые отношения с миролюбивыми, мы не\r\n      испытываем ни малейшей моральной сатисфакции. Открывая планеты с райскими\r\n      условиями жизни, мы лишь недоуменно пожимаем плечами, ибо нам некого туда\r\n      заселять. Мы не извлекаем никакой пользы из богатых ресурсами спутников,\r\n      поскольку не можем развернуть на них добывающую промышленность. Игру\r\n      низводит в могилу именно патологическая недосказанность: такое\r\n      впечатление, будто разработчики не рассчитали свои возможности и\r\n      оказались не в состоянии сделать проект таким, каким он задумывался\r\n      изначально. В результате из него выпирает масса кусочков глобальной\r\n      стратегической игры, но они, увы, никак не связаны между собой.\r\n    \r\n      Чтобы хоть как-то свести их воедино, создателям пришлось выкручиваться\r\n      совсем уж невообразимым образом. Решив, что аркаду можно слепить из\r\n      любого <explicit content>, они ограничили время игры и ввели\r\n      систему набора очков. На все космоприключения отводится десяток лет,\r\n      которые вполне укладываются в десять минут нашего, земного, времени. За\r\n      этот промежуток нужно открыть как можно больше планет, отмутузить как\r\n      можно больше злых обитателей космоса и под завязку набить грузовой отсек\r\n      псевдо-Энтерпрайза пчелами-пираньями, мед которых является мощнейшим\r\n      афродизиаком. Указанные деяния в итоге трансформируются в зачетные баллы.\r\n    \r\n      Действо заканчивается, опускается занавес с нацепленной на него табличкой\r\n      \"high scores\", всех тошнит от несвежих цифровых угрей…\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nРецензия актуальна для \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nСтатья обсуждается на нашем форуме,\nпользователи оставили уже 1 комментарий.Есть что сказать?

Это\r\n      может быть навешиваемая на хребет корабля побрякушка, что-то вроде\r\n      плазменного нитроускорителя с турбонаддувом; в некоторых случаях можно\r\n      стать счастливым обладателем колонии чрезвычайно сообразительных летающих\r\n      бегемотов, а иногда вместо сувенира на борт засылают саботера, который\r\n      отчленяет от корабля какую-нибудь подсистему, или же встречают\r\n      торжественной метеоритной бомбардировкой и вспышкой ближайшей сверхновой,\r\n — это уж как повезет.\r\n    \r\n      Кроме того, желающие могут нежданно-негаданно встретить похожих на\r\n      страусов торговцев расы Klakar и попробовать поменять воздушный шарик\r\n      органического происхождения на пятнадцатиметровый результат греховной\r\n      связи паука и летучей мыши. Но мирные инопланетяне — явление в\r\n      SAIS довольно редкое. Все-таки на большинстве планет балом правят\r\n      воинственные алики. С последними полагается биться в рамках отдельной\r\n      мини-игры — SC 2 в очередной раз улыбается нам платиновыми\r\n      коронками. В космических битвах по версии \"Цифрового Угря\" есть что-то от\r\n      рыцарских турниров. Подобно средневековым удальцам, в поединке вы почти\r\n      не допускаетесь к управлению своим средством передвижения — оно лишь на\r\n      всех парах движется навстречу антиподу. По мере сближения посудины\r\n      раскручивают оружейные системы и начинают самозабвенно поливать друг\r\n      друга разноцветными струйками лазеров; в это время камера пододвигается к\r\n      происходящему поближе, надеясь удивить зрителей эффектным батальным\r\n      ракурсом. Лучше бы она этого, честное слово, не делала. Так бы мы по\r\n      крайней мере не узнали, что модельки всех кораблей рисовались начинающим\r\n      сисадмином в каком-нибудь Deluxe Paint 1.84. То есть Эд Вуд,\r\n      натурально, в гробу не то что вертится, а вытворяет тройные тулупы с\r\n      переворотом.\r\n    \r\n      Парсек за пять сек\r\n    \n\r\n      В определенный момент времени в сознании всякого уважающего себя игрока,\r\n      столкнувшегося с SAIS нос к носу (видимо, ему угрожали Particle\r\n      Vortex Cannon) всплывает такой вопрос: ЗАЧЕМ?! Выкорчевывая с планет\r\n      агрессивных алиенов и вступая в торговые отношения с миролюбивыми, мы не\r\n      испытываем ни малейшей моральной сатисфакции. Открывая планеты с райскими\r\n      условиями жизни, мы лишь недоуменно пожимаем плечами, ибо нам некого туда\r\n      заселять. Мы не извлекаем никакой пользы из богатых ресурсами спутников,\r\n      поскольку не можем развернуть на них добывающую промышленность. Игру\r\n      низводит в могилу именно патологическая недосказанность: такое\r\n      впечатление, будто разработчики не рассчитали свои возможности и\r\n      оказались не в состоянии сделать проект таким, каким он задумывался\r\n      изначально. В результате из него выпирает масса кусочков глобальной\r\n      стратегической игры, но они, увы, никак не связаны между собой.\r\n    \r\n      Чтобы хоть как-то свести их воедино, создателям пришлось выкручиваться\r\n      совсем уж невообразимым образом. Решив, что аркаду можно слепить из\r\n      любого <explicit content>, они ограничили время игры и ввели\r\n      систему набора очков. На все космоприключения отводится десяток лет,\r\n      которые вполне укладываются в десять минут нашего, земного, времени. За\r\n      этот промежуток нужно открыть как можно больше планет, отмутузить как\r\n      можно больше злых обитателей космоса и под завязку набить грузовой отсек\r\n      псевдо-Энтерпрайза пчелами-пираньями, мед которых является мощнейшим\r\n      афродизиаком. Указанные деяния в итоге трансформируются в зачетные баллы.\r\n    \r\n      Действо заканчивается, опускается занавес с нацепленной на него табличкой\r\n      \"high scores\", всех тошнит от несвежих цифровых угрей…\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\n\nРецензия актуальна дляСистемные требованияPentium II 350\n 32 Мб памятиРекомендуемые требованияPentium III 600\n 64 Mб памятиРецензия актуальна дляСтатья обсуждается на нашем форуме,\nпользователи оставили уже 1 комментарий.Есть что сказать?

      "Some of the best quasi-roguelike space games out there are Digital Eel's terrific Infinite Space games: Strange Adventures in Infinite Space, Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space and Sea of Stars: Infinite Space III.  Quick-playing, always challenging, and filled with secrets to discover.  @Play spoke with the principals of Digital Eel, Rich Carlson and Iikka Keränen, about the long-lived series.@P: Tell me about your company -- when was it founded, about the main people and your day jobs?Iikka Keränen: Rich and I unofficially started Digital Eel in 1999 when we both worked at Looking Glass. That's when we bought the domain name and started working on the (never released) 4X strategy game we called Infinite Space. I have been working in the game industry since 1998 when I was hired by Ion Storm in Dallas TX. For the last fifteen years, I've been at Valve.Rich Carlson: I was a musician in Minnesota for 20 years before deciding to try to make games for a living. I met Iikk at Ion. We ended up working at four game studios together! You may recall that Ion Storm, Rogue Entertainment, Looking Glass Studios were all closing, one by one, at the time. That was hard to watch, and hard be a part of but the games turned out well. Meantime, Iikka and I became friends and decided to make some games ourselves for fun. Later, when we came to Seattle for another game job, we met artist Bill Sears working at the same studio. He turned out to be as weird as we are, with a terrific sense of humor, and so we all became fast friends too. That's when Digital Eel was \"officially\" founded. Bill made the splash screen for Plasmaworm and we went on from there as a trio. Henry Kropf is the newest member of the Digital Eel nuclear family. He's been programming professionally for something like 20 years, starting at Vicarious Visions in 1996. (We all started in the game biz at about the same time.) He worked on PC and PS1 projects--the hardcore space-sim, Terminus (Wikipedia), for example. Since then he's worked on a number of projects and ports, most recently for the latter Digital Eel games, as well as being the sole programmer of the fantasy word game SpellBounders (iOS App Store).@P: That's really interesting! The SAIS games have this outsider art feel, I think at least, like they're from some alternate universe where games evolved subtly differently. For some reason it's weird to think you're embedded in the traditional game development community! I find it difficult to believe you'd have the time or energy for this if you guys worked at, for instance, EA. Are you worried that the day job might interfere with the SAIS games?RC: It is outsider art! Although Bill worked at game studios, he came from the era of Kustom Kars, underground comix and lowbrow surrealism. If you've read Juxtapoz or Zap Comix, that's the the realm. That's what you see in Weird Worlds, and on the DE splash screens. 60's and 70's counterculture art (done only as Phosphorus can!)IK: Sometimes it does interfere - Funny that you should mention EA, we actually worked on an EA-published game (American McGee's Alice) after we stopped working on the original Infinite Space \"big game\", and before we made Plasmaworm and SAIS. That was a time when we really didn't have the energy to do our own thing. Valve is much better at not interfering with life outside the office. I think it has to do with it being a more mature company - most people have families and can't be expected to work seven days a week, that sort of stuff.RC: We have to work on our games slowly much of the time. But isn't that best if you can? Slow and steady wins the race. We plan carefully and go step by step. Looking back, 15 games in 14 years says we're finishers not flakes.@P: How did Strange Adventures get started? What are its play inspirations? From whence came the series' unique backstory?IK: We had run out of steam on the original 4X game, and I had realized I needed to learn proper Windows programming as my previous coding experience was DOS-based. As I taught myself DirectX, we made a simple arcade game called Plasmaworm in 2001 and then decided to make another small game using the content we had created for Infinite Space. This is what became Strange Adventures in Infinite Space. I was a big fan of Starflight, and we had also played a Star Trek boardgame that influenced the early design of Strange Adventures quite a bit. At the beginning, we were planning to have text-based mini adventures on each planet, that sort of stuff. But we soon realized that streamlining the game as much as possible was the way to go. We had written a lot of back story for the 1999 \"big game\" and had a very rich universe for you to explore - much more content than you'd ever see in a single session, and that kept the game lively and surprising.RC: Other games we played that were inspiring were Frank Butterfield's Voyage of the BSM Pandora, which turned out to be a kind of proof-of-concept that a big game theme could be condensed into a small, short game yet still convey the feeling, not just the flavor, of a star spanning saga. Though the examples I'm mentioning are fantasy-themed, they played into the design concept directly. Proto-roguelike boardgames like Terrence Donelly's Sorcerer's Cave and Greg Costikyan's Deathmaze, were, like modern full-blown roguelikes like Henzell's Dungeon Crawl and NetHack, strong influences as well.@P: Ah, you said the magic word! Starflight also came up in an interview I did some years back with Tarn Adams of Dwarf Fortress, who also cites it as an inspiration! And Starflight's lead designer Greg Johnson is also one-half of Johnson-Voorsanger, who made ToeJam &amp; Earl, and the prime mover of the current TJ&amp;E sequel/revision! It's starting to seem like Starflight is a secret nexus of inspiration for roguelike developers.RC: Starflight was a big deal. I remember waiting and waiting, exasperated, for the C-64 port to be released. Seemed to take forever but it was worth it. Btw, Starflight's spiritual cousin, Star Control II, strongly influenced the way music is used in Strange Adventures and Weird Worlds.@P: All of those games you mentioned before sound really interesting, especially Greg Costikyan's entry. He's a bit of a NetHack fan himself you know.RC: I didn't. I know he was a hardcore Civ fan. Greg has a fantastic imagination. He's tackled quite a variety of subjects. His ludography is frighteningly impressive. (\"A bibliography is a list of the books you've written; a discography is a list of the music you've recorded; and a ludography is a list of the games you've designed.\" - GC)@P: I'm a bit interested in that 4X game you mentioned. Is that project entirely abandoned or might it reappear someday? Or alternatively, do you feel it's important to be able to abandon a project that's no longer working, or gone in uninteresting directions?IK: We have abandoned a few projects for various reasons. The big 4X game was one - it was just too ambitious for us to finish, too similar to some other games, like Master of Orion, and I didn't really know how to do multi-player code at the time (plus the whole MS-DOS thing!). It was a good choice to switch to smaller projects.RC: For us it's about being caught by something. Like when you get into Game of Thrones or Magic: The Gathering. Only the special, best things capture you. That's what we wait for and pounce on when it shows up!IK: Even if we do decide to make a 4X style game in the Infinite Space universe, it will not be the old project resurrected. But it's interesting how much \"stuff\" from it appears in Sea of Stars - for example, the races and most of the items etc have a direct lineage to the old 4X project.@P: You're calling the games \"space roguelikes,\" could you explain, or even justify, that statement?IK: Right, our games don't exactly look like the typical fantasy roguelike! But they do play like one in many ways. We have the procedurally generated maps, high level of randomness and the sense of being dropped in a world that's bigger than what you can experience in one play-through. There's no saving and reloading, so all your actions are permanent. There are tons of items and it's up to the player to figure out how to best use them. I'm a big fan of traditional roguelikes as well, so I know the dissimilarities too, of course. For a while, we used the moniker \"Roguelike-like\" but it's a bit clumsy.RC: Strange Adventures and the rest of the series pass the test in most cases, yet they must be termed as hybrids. I've looked at the Berlin Interpretation and have thought a lot about this. We respect the pure roguelike form very much, for all of the good reasons. We do sometimes say these games are space roguelikes--but in the same way that FTL was termed that. The primary reason is that it is the best way to describe the Infinite Space gameplay, overall, with just one word. Describing SAIS as \"space strategy\" or \"adventure strategy\" or \"strategy rpg\" doesn't convey the gameplay experience at all!@P: I didn't mean to imply that your games couldn't be roguelikes, we've certainly covered enough games that blur the lines! And I agree that \"roguelike-like\" is a bit clumsy, as you've probably witnessed, there's a bit of confusion on the proper way to identify games that are inspired by Rogue's randomness and replayable elements but aren't strictly top-down, tactical combat, dungeon exploration.RC: We have to remember that the first makers of roguelikes didn't invent the Berlin list. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson did. A roguelike is what it is (a randomized, turn-based D&amp;D/Tolkien themed dungeon survival sim on a grid) because early roguelike creators were emulating the features of their favorite game. So, while the venerable roguelike form can number and claim these traits, it can't really own them.@P: Describe the basic \"explore a space in a limited time\" gameplay.RC: One roguelike aspect that isn't always mentioned--I don't think it's on the Berlin list--is clocks. Food clock. Radiation exposure clock. Spell duration clocks. Thirst clock. Poison damage clock. Etc. If one of these clocks time out, your character is in trouble, which adds more tension to the game. Awesome! I think clocks are an essential part of a roguelike game. Sea of Stars, Weird Worlds and Strange Adventures use clocks too. The primary one is to return to player character's homeworld within a set period of time or suffer a reward penalty. This victory condition mirrors somewhat the idea of Star Trek's \"five year mission\", or Darwin's voyage, or a pirate adventure for that matter.@P: The alien races provide a good mix of beings to interact with, each of which presenting their own personality in behavior, text and combat. Any favorites?RC: I really like one of the new species we added to Sea of Stars, the Calatians. They're mentioned in the previous games but actually make an appearance in IS3 as a full-fledged race. They boast of their mighty ships and fearsome weaponry that appear in conbat as small and unthreatening. Are they bluffing? (Tip: If you're nice to them, you might even get rewarded with one to add to your flotilla.)IK: The Tchorak have been my favorite for a long time, just because they are so... alien. Of course, I know much more about them than you'll see in any of our games, but I hope you'll get to know them better one of these days.RC: I can't wait to explain the sex life of a Tchorak. Or maybe I can.@P: Secret item features (Like \"hypervision,\" or the Lookout Frogs & Toy Robot, or the Crystal Fish?) What inspired them? Why don't more items have these features? Is there a magic number?IK: These items are a bit like a card that allows you to break one specific rule in a boardgame - they're limited by the number of rules that can be broken in a useful way. I do agree we should think of more, there are probably fun things that we've missed.RC: What Iikka said. There is a sweet spot where it feels good and we sort of \"call it.\" But it's also a matter of seeing a possibile connection that might be interesting or entertaining or, more importantly, useful. If the designer puts a ship thief in the game, she should put one or two things in to help the player prevent theft as well.@P: One-in-eight games in the original two Infinite Space games are \"mission games,\" where the game rules change slightly and unexpectedly in the middle of play? What inspired them?IK: I think it was at least partly inspired by some random events in 4X games, like Master of Orion where occasionally a \"space amoeba\" appears and starts to wreak havoc. In Strange Adventures we just had one, and we didn't want it to happen every time because that would have made the game very repetitive, so we made it fairly rare. Now, in Sea of Stars we have five different missions (and counting...) and we can just randomly pick one.RC: These games are intended to be like instant space opera generators, so it stands to reason that every once in a while a chance to \"save the galaxy,\" or save your character's homeworld, etc., should be included. It also breaks the game up from session to session, enhancing replayabilty, we hope, by helping to keep things fresh and surprising.@P: One interesting thing about Weird Worlds in particular is how frequently one can come up non-combat, or what we might call \"instant win\" solutions to game problems, like [SPOILERS] Mirroring enemy fleets into black holes, Vacuum Collapsing the Yellow Kawangii or using the Chromium Gong on Primordius. These solutions seems to be deprecated somewhat in Sea of Stars in favor of more traditional combat. Is there a particular reason?IK: With the exception of the mirror, these still work :) But we have tried to balance some items to make them less game-breaking - the gong no longer has unlimited uses, the hyperdrive is not always the best choice, and so on. This is mainly done to keep the game challenging even if you find the item.@P: On the play changes with each version. Especially the substantial formula changes in Sea of Stars (Maj. Brass prologue dropped, set sector size, no need to return home at end, all mission games, removal of popular earlier items like Aetheric Mirror and Mantle of Babulon.) Was this to fix a perceived lack in the earlier games? Is the new game's 3D starmap related to them? Will we see any of these items return in later updates?IK: We chose not to implement the mirror for various reasons - for example, we don't want you to accidentally move Haven Station or the Klakar Nest. If we made space stations non-mirrorable like the space hulk was in Weird Worlds, then you'd keep running into situations where you get a sensor blip but can't use the mirror, and that tells you it's a homeworld. If the mirror ever does appear, it will need to have some different kind of behavior. The Mantle would be easy enough to make, but as in Weird Worlds it would end up reducing your score so it's not a great item - also, combat is fun! It would perhaps be more interesting to come up with other ways to befriend specific races.@P: Maybe describe a bit on the use of nebulas &amp; black holes, their role in the design as an obstacle to exploration. (Nebulas usually slow the player down greatly upon entry; Black Holes may be hidden at the start of a map, and force the player to decide to turn back to forge ahead and possibly risk losing immediately.)IK: Since we're dealing with a time limit, adding \"terrain\" forces you to make plans around it and makes the game more interesting, and different each time. We originally had ideas for other kinds of obstacles, like asteroid fields, but just these two made the cut.@P: Events — derelict ship, supernova, Esmeralda, alien rescues. Their appearance, and the timing with which they appear, has the potential to either profoundly change the game, or not really change it much at all, depending on when they turn up, it feels to me like an essential part of the Infinite Space experience. Do you agree?IK: Oh yes, these are a big part of making each game session unique and giving you the sense that almost anything can happen in the Infinite Space universe, from the silly to the spectacular.@P: The Infinite Space games have board and card game versions? What are they like?RC: They're fun. Eat Electric Death! is an old school hex and turn-based tactical starship combat boardgame based on the ships, ship system, items, and the way ships manuever, in the computer game versions. Infinite Space: Explorers is essentially a starship combat card game that uses a \"starmap\" board to keep track of where fleets are, which stars have been explored and where card battles occur. The two Diceland Space sets based in the IS games use James Ernest's unique combat system with giant paper dice. Each die is a starship and you roll them on the table in combat. It's diceless and real time. Nobody makes games like Cheapass Games.@P: How did James Ernst and Cheapass Games help the Strange Adventures series to get started?RC: By generously providing a distribution point for the game. Indie game portals didn't exist then, so it was terrific to have his support. He also got CD's made of the first three or four games. Those are like collector's items now.@P: On mods... Where did you get the idea to make the game moddable? How easy is it, would you say, to make a mod? What are your favorite mods?IK: Rich and I both made mods before we started working in the game industry, so it was natural to us. I also think that the same things that make the game easy to modify, make it easier for us to create the content for it in the first place. There are a lot of cool mods, but the \"Even Stranger\" and \"Even Weirder\" series is a standout favorite for sure. Modding tends to get harder as games get more complex, but we try to make it as easy as possible. In Sea of Stars, we use standard text file format to store all the data in the game so it's possible to get started with just a text editor.@P: Will we see the return of Major Brass?IK: He's the face of the Terran Space Fleet :) Not sure if he's going to make a personal appearance, but anything's possible!RC: New face; same Brass.@P: Who was Phosphorous?IK: Phosphorous, aka. Bill Sears was the third Eel and our main artist for over a decade. He made the splash screen art for half a dozen games, tons of Weird Worlds items and creatures, etc. We had some unforgettable times together, and multiple road trips down to IGF in California. He passed away after a heart attack in 2012. We really miss him.RC: Bill was an amazing friend and contributor. And musician, as we later found out! But not in the traditional sense of guitars and trombones. His music was strange, handmade in his garage and surrealistic. Technically it would be called musique concrete and found sound music. You know how it is. Usually when you hear sound collages that are a bit avant garde, you say no! Turn it off! But it isn't that way at all with Bill's music. It is engrossing like falling into a mind adventure. Very special stuff.@P: Is any of his music in the games? Do you think there might be a place for it, even if just one or two pieces, or are there rights or thematic issues? Is there a place where readers can find them on the internet?IK: Bill created music for both Brainpipe (Steam - Desura) and Data Jammers (Steam - Desura). We shared an Independent Games Festival audio award for Brainpipe. You can listen to some of Bill's music for Data Jammers here, and mixed medleys of Brainpipe music here: Smetlov's Locus - Trippocampus - Cognative Cascade.Thanks to Rich and Iikka for talking with me, and for putting up with my whimsical and makeshift interview process!  Which reminds me, I still have a followup interview with Tarn Adams to finish....  by the way, surprise!  This isn't from the book but is an entirely new column!  I'll probably be splitting the column between book stuff and entirely new essays for a while, so don't forget about the site even if you already have it!",
      "Strange Adventures in Infinite Space was the first game of its kind: a Rogue-like space adventure. Dubbed “A Perfect Short Game” in a Gamasutra article by Ernest Adams, it gathered critical acclaim and eventually spawned a much awaited sequel Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space that brought this style of gameplay to more modern systems with OpenGL graphics and award-winning audio track.Strange Adventures in Infinite Space is also an example of the scratchware concept: professional quality, original games with high replayability, made by just a couple of people with freeware tools for no development cost.After being sold for several years by Cheapass Games, Strange Adventures in Infinite Space was released as free software and its source code was made available under the GNU General Public License.

      "Cheapass Games is known by board-game aficionados as a publisher of simple, fast, and surprisingly fun games with fairly low production values and very low prices. Strange Adventures in Infinite Space translates almost everything that is fun about this type of gaming to the computer without feeling like a computer port of something you'd have found 20 years ago in Dragon magazine. Paradoxically, the concept and mechanics of Strange Adventures are very similar to those of the old magazine games. The graphics are extremely dated, and the sound is minimal, but the basic idea and implementation are outstanding.The game's concept is simple: You're presented with a playing field of roughly 15 stars. Your task is to explore as many of them as possible in 10 years, bring back as many valuable artifacts and exotic life-forms to your home planet as you can, and defeat as many aliens as possible along the way. Traveling from star to star is measured in days, and passing through nebulae significantly increases your travel time, so you have to plan your travels somewhat. Once you reach an unexplored system, you are presented with an encounter. It can be an alien race, an artifact, a new life-form, or perhaps a friendly starship that will join your flotilla. As you proceed from system to system, you collect your findings and fight (or trade with) aliens in preparation for bringing your booty back to your home system.Your starship has upgradeable components that you can improve as you find new items in your travels. Many of the things you find will be useful to you on board your craft. Early on you have basic weapons, shields, and drives, but after a few chance encounters with some new ships, as well as the acquisition of a new weapon or two, your little armada can become quite formidable. Because this is completely random, you'll find some games where you're completely on your own, and others where you're a miniature fleet admiral. Part of the fun of the game is taking advantage of opportunities to fight when they're presented to you by chance.Starship combat involves a pauseable real-time system that takes weapon ranges, ship speed, and component types into account. There are a number of alien races you can encounter, and there is even a combat simulator in which you can test out various weapons and strategies against different enemies. One of the most amusing episodes we experienced was the sight of a ship being harassed by a single tiny fighter. Because the ship was only armed with slow missiles, it could never get them to hit the fighter, which kept outmaneuvering the attacks. However, the fighter could not inflict enough damage to punch through the larger ship's shields. The result was a standoff that was as whimsical as the game itself.The randomness of the game makes it difficult to plan a strategy, since so much depends on what your encounters present to you. If you're lucky to find an improved interstellar drive early on, you'll likely be able to explore most of the planets and get a high score. However, it's quite possible that at some point on your return journey you'll run into a previously undiscovered black hole and have to choose between turning back and going a different way or proceeding and possibly being blown up. Since the game penalizes you heavily for taking longer than 10 years to carry out your mission, you'll seriously hurt your score if you retreat, so you have little choice but to proceed. These types of random encounters make Strange Adventures seem a bit like an adventure game, where you don't quite know what's going to happen and are in a sense just along for the ride.The game's short length is what makes it so engaging. In a longer game, the random nature of the encounters and lack of player input would become frustrating, but since you can finish a game in five to 15 minutes, you can always just start another one immediately afterward. Strange Adventures is an addictive little game much like Bejeweled or Tetris, but instead of being a puzzle, it's a little adventure that you can lose yourself in for a few minutes at a time. For $15, it's a great buy that will end up being one of those games you keep running in the background and fire up for a while when you need a break. Designers Rich Carlson and Iikka Keranen have managed to capture the feeling of \"what will happen next?\" that marked gameplay in very early computer games, with a style that is attractive today.We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.Use your keyboard!",

The company (producer of the Game Developers Conference series, Gamasutra.com and Game Developer magazine) established the Independent Games Festival in 1998 to encourage innovation in game development and to recognize the best independent game developers.Read MoreApril  8, 2013  6:01 AM | John PolsonDigital Eel is running a Kickstarter for Infinite Space 3: Sea of Stars, the follow-up to its indie space-roguelikes, Weird Worlds and the 11-year-old freeware, Strange Adventures in Infinite Space.The core of the game is still a single-player science fiction roguelike, with permadeath, turn-based map navigation, and a real-time combat system. The devs say the game will provide \"a randomly generated open world for you to explore, and will only reveal a fraction of its secrets each time you play.\"Sea of Stars also promises new material and gameplay. \"Discovering the interactions between items, alien races, characters and random events will keep you busy for years - yet each session of the game is a complete adventure that you can finish in one sitting. To extend the game's longevity even further, we encourage people to make mods and even provide tools for it!\"But a few days old, the Kickstarter project for Sea of Stars has already earned over $15,000 of its $30,000 goal. $10 nabs a Windows version of the game, with an estimated release of December 2013. A Mac version will follow, and the devs may add a stretch goal for Linux support. Finally, tablets may be possible in the future through third-party support.Tags: digital eel,kickstarter,strange adventures in infinite spaceCategories: \n              \n              Desktop,Mobilemobile\ndesktopFreeware Pick: Tsunami Cruiser (Boris van Schooten)-October  1, 2014 12:00 PMLet's Play Mini Metro, a puzzle game about public transport-September 23, 2014  4:28 AMBoson X reaches critical velocity on Steam-September 17, 2014  3:01 AMThe Masterplan will make you really good at stealing things-September 15, 2014  8:43 AMAltitude0 soars onto Steam Early Access-September 10, 2014  8:24 AMHatoful Boyfriend remake on Steam today, allows you to flirt with birds-September  4, 2014  9:05 AMHexcells Infinite is the next evolution of Minesweeper-September  1, 2014  9:18 AMGridland is a survival/match-3 crossover game-August 27, 2014  1:23 PMGorgeous point-and-click adventure Detective Grimoire out on Steam today-August 18, 2014  5:57 AMCloud Chamber: Turning a TV series into a video game-August  7, 2014  7:02 AMShadowcrypt: a 2D arcade/platformer inspired by Zelda II-July 15, 2014  2:00 PMSteam Greenlight Pick & Demo: Move or Die-June 19, 2014  4:00 AMSpace Run released on Steam today-June 13, 2014  7:04 AMDead Synchronicity brings dystopian, dark point&clickness to Kickstarter-March 27, 2014  5:15 PMFree Game Pick: Renegade (Waldemar Umaniz)-March 15, 2014 10:35 AMDonationware Pick: The Way of Yiji and more in Schizoid's game album Initiation-February  5, 2014  9:45 PMBrowser Pick: Tiny Dangerous Dungeons-November 21, 2013 10:00 PMFreeware pick: Magical Majorette Drummer Garnet: Handsome Boy Blues-November  6, 2013  5:00 PMFreeware Pick: One Shots !!

      "Iikka Keränen, a native of Finland, lives in Seattle, Washington with his wife Rose and two cats. He is a level designer at Valve Corporation.[1] He also co-founded Digital Eel, an independent video game development group, in 2001. His range of professional skills include illustration, 2D game art, 3D modeling, programming and game design.In his teens, Keränen programmed freeware games for the Commodore Amiga. Later he created the popular Quake mod Airquake,[1] as well as over a hundred free add-on levels for the Doom and Quake series of first-person shooters. He was named the top Doom level maker of all time by Doomworld in 1998, described as \"one of a few pioneer level designers that created the new bottom line for playability and design in Doom levels, as well as helping to develop some of the special FX that many level authors now take for granted\".[2]In recent years he has created 3D architecture, textures and models for many well known computer games including Daikatana, Anachronox, Thief II: The Metal Age, American McGee's Alice and Valve Corporation's Counter-Strike, Half-Life 2, Portal 2, Day of Defeat and Team Fortress 2. In December 2005, Iikka completed \"Argentan\", a map for the multiplayer game Day of Defeat: Source.His Digital Eel credits include design, programming and art. He co-designed all Digital Eel games to date (Plasmaworm, Strange Adventures in Infinite Space, Dr. Blob's Organism, Digital Eel's Big Box of Blox, Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space, Eat Electric Death!, Soup du Jour, Goblin Slayer and Brainpipe) with Rich Carlson.This biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification.

      "Canals (de_canals) is a bomb defusal map featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.On March 15, 2017 Canals was added to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, along with the Spectrum Case and new models for the Phoenix Connexion terrorists.The map recreates the general area around Piazza San Marco (also known as the St. Mark's Square) in Venice. Recreated landmarks include Doge's Palace (Palazzo Ducale), Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri), St Mark's Basilica, St Mark's Campanile, St Mark's Clocktower, and the Columns of San Marco and San Todaro. [1]The base of St Mark's Campanile serves as Bombsite A, while Bridge of Sighs serves as Bombsite B.Canals is based on real-world environments and the idea for the map Canals originally came to Iikka Keränen after visiting Venice.[2][3] Originally, the map was called de_venice but despite the shared name, it was not related to the earlier cancelled Venice map by Ido Magal.[2] The aesthetics were intentionally given a clean and uncluttered look despite the real-world influence to enhance player visibility.[3]Creator(s)Iikka KeränenGame(s)ScenarioBomb DefusalMap GroupDefusal Group SigmaTerroristsPhoenix ConnexionCounter-TerroristsSEAL Team 6First appearanceCounter-Strike: Global OffensiveLast appearanceCounter-Strike: Global OffensiveThis article/section is under construction.While this article/section is still under construction.

      "Counter-Strike (also marketed as Half-Life: Counter-Strike) is a multiplayer first-person shooter initially created by Minh Le and Jess Cliffe as a mod for Half-Life. By the fifth beta, Valve Software started actively participating in the development and ultimately bought the rights to the game and offered the original developers jobs at the company which both of them accepted.After about a year in Beta stages, the first full release of the mod was published on November 9, 2000 and the game was also available at retailers in North America shortly thereafter, on November 14, 2000.Since the creation of the franchise, various sequels and spinoffs have been created, such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, and the latest in the series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.The fast-paced and team-oriented gameplay of Counter-Strike has stayed relatively the same throughout the years. In it, two teams, the Counter-Terrorists and the Terrorists, fight to complete an objective or eliminate the opposing team. Although basic, it is considered one of the most revolutionary online games of all time. The original Counter-Strike came exclusively with multiplayer, without computer-controlled players. Over time, however, several server-side modifications have added bots for in-game use and bots were officially introduced in its later successors, Counter-Strike (Xbox) and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero.Counter-Strike has been praised worldwide for its highly competitive multiplayer. The decision to make the game multiplayer only roots back to its mod origins. Doing a single-player game would have entailed much more work as new models and AI code would have been needed for enemies as opposed to a multiplayer game which requires considerably less work.[2]There are three official scenarios, each with their own teams, objectives, and maps. In all cases, the two teams are the Counter-Terrorists face off against the Terrorists.In the original retail release, a short single-player only training map was included but this was removed when the game was transferred to Steam.There are three official scenarios in Counter-Strike: Assassination, hostage rescue and bomb defusal. A fourth scenario, known as escape, existed during the Counter-Strike Beta. The scenario itself is still playable, but all of the official maps were removed prior to the game's release.In this scenario hostages are being held by the Terrorists. Official maps feature between 3 and 5 hostages, though most maps feature 4 hostages. The Counter-Terrorist team needs to rescue these hostages by escorting them to a hostage rescue zone. The Terrorists must prevent the hostages from being rescued. Victory can also be attained by eliminating the opposing team.This scenario features two bombsites and one Terrorist starts off with a C4. The bomb must be planted at either bombsite. After the bomb has been planted, it will explode after a certain amount of time. During this time, Counter-Terrorists may attempt to defuse the bomb and successful defusal will make the Counter-Terrorists victorious. If the bomb explodes, the Terrorists will win the round. It is also possible to win a round by eliminating the opposing team.This scenario is the least popular of the three and only a single map, Oilrig, is featured in the latest release of the game. In this scenario a single player on the Counter-Terrorist team takes the role of a VIP that must make it to a VIP escape zone. Some maps feature only one escape zone while others feature multiple escape zones. The Terrorists have to take out the VIP and successfully eliminating the VIP will yield victory to the Terrorists. Both teams have a restricted arsenal of weapons available for purchase. Like in other scenarios, victory can also be attained by eliminating the opposing team.Counter-Strike features a large variety of maps that take place in different environments including urban, arctic, jungle and desert settings. During the post-beta stages, maps were still rotated in the official distribution on a slightly smaller scale. Since the release of Counter-Strike 1.6, no maps have been added or removed from the game.It should be noted that the majority of maps for the game were created by people that were originally simply hobbyist mappers. When Valve Software later bought the rights to Counter-Strike and its content these became the first works published at retail for many of the level designers.[3]There are 25 official maps in the latest version of Counter-Strike.*This map was exclusive to the mod edition of the game.Counter-Strike features a variety of weapons, ranging from knives to shotguns and submachine guns. The weapons for Counter-Strike were chosen mainly based on two criteria. For one, the weapons had to be satisfying to use and they had to look and sound cool. The other criteria was realism and what weapons the factions would likely be using in real-life. The former of these criteria was given more weight than ensuring authenticity.[4]Inspiration for potential weapon candidates were taken from various movies.[5] For example, the movie Ronin inspired the inclusion of the Krieg 552 and M249.[6] Further inspiration was also taken from the movies Air Force One and the Professional.[5]Most of the information regarding the weapons themselves was sourced from the internet or from gun magazines.[7] Because limited information was available regarding some of the weapons, Minh Le had to guess how some weapons could have functioned when animating them and thus a few weapon models exhibit differences when compared to their real-world counterparts.[8]Counter-Strike notably features left-handed weapon view models. These models were made as left-handed because the creator of these models and the main man behind Counter-Strike, Minh Le, is left-handed and thus preferred animating the weapons from that side.[9] The game features a possibility of changing the models to right-handed, but as the models are simply mirrored from their left-handed counterparts they sport some inaccuracies when compared to their real-world counterparts.Counter-Strike features a total of 25 weapons, some of which are exclusive to the Counter-Terrorists and others which are exclusive to the Terrorists. The list also indicates the original name of a weapon from the mod release if applicable.Along with the weapons, there are nine pieces of acquirable equipment, three of which are grenades. If ammunition, the radio and the flashlight are to be included, the number of equipment is increased to twelve.Counter-Strike features a number of different factions that are aligned either with the Counter-Terrorists or the Terrorists. The only difference between factions of the same side is the player model that will be visible to other players. Thus for example on snow themed maps, players may favor picking the Arctic Avengers when playing as Terrorists due to their white camouflage.Player models for the Counter-Strike Beta had been created by Minh Le, however for the full release Valve Software stepped in to provide new player models because the old models were inefficient in terms of polygon count and texture sizes.[10] These models were created by Chuck Jones and Stephen Theodore.[11][12] In Counter-Strike 1.1 these models were enhanced with higher resolution textures and the C4 and the defusal kit were re-added to the player models.With the release of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero 1.1 on April 28, 2004 it became possible for owners of Condition Zero to use the enhanced player models in this game. Previously, there used to be no direct way of disabling these upgraded models.[13] In the update issued on February 2, 2013 it was finally made possible to toggle these models at will via an Enable HD models if available checkbox.[14] Ticking this checkbox will also replace all models used from the original Half-Life, including the scientist model sometimes used for hostages, with their HD counterparts.Each team has four available factions that players can choose as their third-person model.The game started out as a Half-Life modification on the GoldSrc engine. It went through numerous iterations and it grew in popularity to become one of the most popular first-person shooters of all time. During the fifth beta Valve Software decided to get involved and eventually purchased the rights to the game.On August 31, 2000 it was announced that Counter-Strike would be released as a retail product in addition to also being available as a mod for Half-Life.[15] The decision to turn the game into a retail product was made as it was felt that a retail release would make the game more accessible.[16] Valve Software also wanted to see how the market would react to a multiplayer product that didn't require Half-Life.[16]With the impending retail release, various legal issues had to be sorted out. One of these issues was the weapon names. They were changed to bogus names in order to avoid legal issues.[17] In addition to simply purchasing the rights to the game, Valve Software also had to approach each level designer and artist to secure the rights to the maps and textures. Some textures were found to have dubious origins and they had to be remade or censored, which lead to some changes in maps for the retail release.[18][19] While Minh Le had hoped that all maps would have been made part of the retail release,[20] Valve opted to only include some of the maps in the retail release. For the maps that weren't purchased by Valve, Minh Le decided to reimburse the authors out of his own pockets despite him having no obligation to do so.[18]Naturally, the new version of the game would also feature new content. Three new weapons were modeled for the release by Minh Le. Also, all new player models were provided by Valve Software.[10] Maverick Developments was also contracted to produce a training map for the retail version of the game.[21]In October it was stated that the mod version of the game would be released as soon as the retail version had gone gold.[22] On November 9, 2000 it was announced that the retail release had gone gold, thus the mod version was released.[23] The retail version appeared on store shelves in North America on November 14, 2000.[24]Much like during the beta stages, various patches were released for the game after its full release. Since Valve was now involved, updates that needed substantial changes to the engine were also possible. This included the introduction of a brand new spectator mode in Counter-Strike 1.1, voice-over communications in Counter-Strike 1.3 and anti-cheating technology in Counter-Strike 1.4. On June 12, 2002 Counter-Strike 1.5 was released which was the final version of the game available as a separately downloadable patch before the game was transferred to Steam.Counter-Strike had already made an appearance on Steam during early closed beta testing of both Counter-Strike 1.4 and the content delivery platform in early 2002.[25] In March 2002, this beta testing was also opened to the public.[26] However the use of Steam at this point was strictly for beta testing purposes and there were no plans to make the actual game available via Steam yet.[27] Valve had wanted to make the game available on Steam coinciding with the release of Counter-Strike 1.5, but they eventually fell behind schedule and the transfer to Steam had to wait until Counter-Strike 1.6.[28]In October 2002 the news were dropped that Counter-Strike 1.6 would initially be made available via Steam and that a beta test would precede the actual release.[29] Public beta testing was initially to commence in mid-November,[30] but the date was first pushed back to mid-December[31] until testing finally commenced on January 16, 2003.[32] However, due to overwhelming demand further beta admissions were quickly suspended since the Steam servers ran out of bandwidth.[33] Steam and thus the Counter-Strike 1.6 beta was made publicly available again on February 11, 2003.[34]The game would be updated numerous times during this beta test and Counter-Strike 1.6 saw the inclusion of new weapons and a completely new interface based on the VGUI2 technology by Valve Software. The official bot that was being developed by Turtle Rock Studios for Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was also beta tested by the public in Counter-Strike 1.6 between June 5, 2003[35] and September 9, 2003[36].[37] After over half a year of public beta testing, beta testing concluded on September 9, 2003.[38] The final release of Counter-Strike 1.6 was initially supposed to be released the very next day,[38] however last minute changes to the Steam network took longer than expected and the final version of Counter-Strike 1.6 was released on September 12, 2003 together with the Steam client.[39][40][41]Counter-Strike 1.6 ended up being the last major content update for the game and the version number is now commonly used as a title to differentiate the original game from the rest of the series. Since the release of Steam, various smaller patches have been released which have introduced fixes to bugs/exploits or smaller balance changes. A Counter-Strike 1.7 was planned for merging the online communities of Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero,[42] but such an update was never released.In 2007 an update was introduced that caused quite a lot of controversy even before its introduction: in-game advertisements.[43] Despite the negative reaction by the community,[44] these advertisements would go on to decorate parts of the interface and the walls of some maps for a period of six years before they were eventually removed in 2013 when Counter-Strike was transferred over to the SteamPipe content delivery system.On January 29, 2013 a beta of the game was made available for Linux and Mac OS X and on February 14, 2013 support for these platforms was officially released.[45][46]The sound effects for the game were primarily the responsibility of Jess Cliffe.[47] Sounds for the Radio Commands and the Announcer were in fact recorded by him.[48]Some sound effects were also done by other people.[8] For example, the sound effects for the M249 were contributed by an actual employee of Fabrique Nationale, the manufacturer of the weapon.[49]An advertising campaign was also launched by the publisher, Sierra Entertainment, in late 2000. This campaign saw advertisements for the game appearing in various gaming publications including Computer Gaming World and PC Gamer.[51][52] Sierra also launched their official website for the game on November 4, 2000.[53]Perhaps in an effort to increase the value of the original retail edition, other Half-Life mods were included in the package. These were Half-Life Deathmatch, Half-Life: Opposing Force Capture the Flag, FireArms, Redemption, Wanted! and Team Fortress Classic. All of these mods included only the multiplayer component.The official strategy guide for the game was published by Versus Books.[54] Other than including regular gameplay hints, it also includes 2D overviews of the retail version maps.[55] At the time of publishing this was quite useful since overviews weren't made part of the game until Counter-Strike 1.3.When Counter-Strike left beta stages and the first complete build was released, two different editions of the game were available: mod and retail. After the game was transferred over to Steam, both of these editions were discontinued and only the Steam version is still supported. Since the release of the Steam version, the legacy editions (mod and retail) have been retroactively referred to as the the WON version based on the name of the matchmaking service used by those editions.This was essentially the edition that was the most direct continuation of the beta releases. The mod edition of the game could be downloaded from the official Counter-Strike web site and required Half-Life to be installed in order to be playable.Because this distribution was a mod just like the previous beta releases, this edition of the game kept the real weapon names. Also, this edition had exclusive maps that were not included in the retail edition as Valve Software had not bought the rights to all maps.[56] The exclusive maps were Arabstreets, Dust2, Estate, Foption, Highrise, Inferno, Nuke, Rotterdam, Tundra, Vegas and Vertigo. Some of these maps were removed/introduced in subsequent patches.When Counter-Strike was transferred to Steam with version 1.6, this edition was discontinued.This edition was the first standalone release of Counter-Strike and Half-Life was not required to play the game. Since this edition of the game was like any other regular retail game release, Valve Software had to alter the weapon names and used made up names to prevent having to face legal issues.[17] On a more curious note, the names of two Terrorist factions were also slightly altered for this edition. It is not known why this change was made or why it was exclusive to this edition of the game.Valve Software had only bought the rights to some of the maps that were part of Counter-Strike, thus this release included fewer maps than the mod edition of the game.[56] Separate map packs were released via the official web site that added the missing maps to this edition.[57] However, the training map was exclusive to this edition of the game.[58]Older retail releases including the original Half-Life: Counter-Strike, Half-Life: Generation and Half-Life: Platinum Collection include this edition of the game.When Counter-Strike was transferred to Steam with version 1.6, this edition was discontinued.This edition of the game was based on the retail edition meaning that it uses made-up weapon names and the slightly altered Terrorist faction names. Compared to the retail edition many of the missing maps were added. The added maps were Dust2, Estate, Inferno, Nuke and Vertigo. Curiously the training map was removed.Newer retail releases including Counter-Strike 1 Anthology include this edition of the game.This is the only edition that is still supported and is still occasionally being updated. Owners of the retail edition or the original Half-Life retail release can migrate to this edition by activating the CD key on Steam.Counter-Strike has received generally favorable reviews, scoring an average of 88/100 and 89/100 on the aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings respectively.[59][60]Reviewers praised the teamplay and social aspects of the game. Scott Osbourne of GameSpot thought the round based gameplay allowed chatting dead players forming a sense of tension.[62] Clayton Wolfe of IGN thought that successful teamplay was the recipe for ensuring a victory for ones team.[63] At Computer Games Magazine, Bill Hiles stated that \"teamwork is crucial for success\" and noted that better players utilized coordinated team efforts to succeed in the game.[61]The choice of weapons was praised by Osbourne, with him stating that \"one of Counter-Strike's biggest appeals has always been the selection of weapons\".[62] Dan Watson of PC Gameworld thought the weapon modeling was excellent and that they handled realistically.[64]While Wolfe felt that the weapon purchasing system was frustrating at first, it quickly stated feeling like an enhancement to the online experience.[63] Watson thought the purchasing system brought a great deal of variety to the game, stating that \"one round may find you perched on a fire escape with a high-caliber sniper rifle, while on the next round you may choose to bust in the front door with a double-barreled shotgun\".[64]Journalists were torn on the graphical side of the game. Osbourne stated that \"the Half-Life graphics engine may be dated now, but Counter-Strike has always used it to its fullest potential\" and thought the new player model graphics were especially good.[62] Wolfe stated that \"visually the game will not disappoint\" even though the Half-Life engine was dated and thought the environmental textures looked \"realistic enough\".[63] Watson however thought the game had a noticeably dated look, stating that \"no amount of tweaking can disguise the fact that this engine is based on a two-year-old core, and a facelift would really work wonders\".[64]The weapon sound effects were well received by Osbourne, Wolfe and Watson. Scott Osbourne thought \"the guns sound remarkably realistic and powerful, which makes them viscerally fun to shoot\".[62] IGN editor Wolfe concluded that \"the realistic guns sounds are spot on\".[63] Watson thought the sound effects in overall were on par or superior to other games on the market.[64] However, Wolfe thought that the other sound effects used sounded wimpy and he had hoped for deeper bass and clearer sounds.[63]Generally, reviewer concluded that the retail release was a good buy for people who didn't own Half-Life or didn't have access to high-speed internet connections.[61][62][63] It was also seen as a good release from the point of convenience as everything needed to play the game online was available on a single CD.[61]As of December 3, 2008, Counter-Strike has sold over 4.2 million retail copies, more than any other Valve game besides Half-Life and its sequel, Half-Life 2.[65] Since Counter-Strike is also available as a modification for Half-Life, part of the Half-Life sales are commonly attributed to the success of Counter-Strike.[66] In fact, the sales of Half-Life increased year-on-year for a few years after its release which was very unusual at the time as most games had a shelf life of around 3 months. Gabe Newell attributed this pattern to the popularity of Counter-Strike and thought the release of the mod was the best thing that could have happened to Half-Life.[67]After its release, the game topped many lists as the most popular online game.[68][69] Even in 2015, 15 years after the release of the game, the game frequented the top 25 games played on Steam list and its longevity has outlasted both Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and Counter-Strike: Source.[70][71]Counter-Strike has won various awards. It won the Game Developers Conference Game Spotlight award in 2001.[72] The game was also granted the Game of the Year 2000 title by Gamers.com while Voodoo Extreme gave it the readers choice award.[73] Computer Games Magazine, Game Revolution, Electronic Playground and GameSpot (UK and US) all granted it the award of best online/multiplayer game of 2000.[73]Counter-Strike is considered one of the most influential multiplayer games of all time.[74] The game is also attributed to having pushed the competitive gaming movement forward.[75] It has also been reported that Counter-Strike was the first game for which a fantasy league was started.[76]Developer(s)Valve CorporationPublisher(s)Valve CorporationSierra EntertainmentPlatform(s)Microsoft WindowsMac OS XLinuxRelease date(s)June

      "Infinite Space Explorers is a game of exploration and discoveries.  Fleets are moved from system to system on a star map.  New events occur, and new items and allies are found, along the way.  Conflict between competitive aliens is likely, and combat between starship fleets is almost certain.  All such interaction is handled by brisk card play.ISE is designed to set up and play easily and quickly, yet provide the essence of a star spanning galactic adventure.  Discoveries are randomized so each game is different.Infinite Space Explorers includes:ISE is based on the award winning indie computer games, Strange Adventures in Infinite Space and Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space and features the same oddball aliens, peculiar artifacts, exotic starships and artwork by Bill \"Phosphorous\" Sears.Please note that because of the particular board configuration used, ISE is played as either a two player game or as a four player game.  Rules for solo and three player games are not included.UPDATE: Infinite Space Explorers X-1 -- the first card expansion for Infinite Space Explorers -- has been released.

      "We have now reached our initial goal, but are still seeking funds for improvements to the game. See explanations of the Stretch Goals in earlier update.Latest update (4/28/2013): Success! Plus, art team members finally revealed!A long time (12 years) ago in a galaxy far, far away (a suburb of Seattle) three people working full-time in the game industry got together in their spare time and created something with a long name: Strange Adventures in Infinite Space. It was a genre-busting indie classic, with 8-bit graphics not because it was hip and retro but because I based its graphics engine largely on \"Windows Game Programming for Dummies\".Its strengths were in its quirky, humorous writing and the addictive nature of the short-form gameplay where your brutal defeat in combat would have you click the restart button rather than giving up. SAIS would soon be called \"The Perfect Short Game\" in an article by a Real Famous Game Designer and get all manner of accolades, followed by a sequel with an equally long name: Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space. In the meantime I had read up on OpenGL so the game was a bit easier on the eyes. It also made quite a splash and gained a cult following, partly because it was designed with user-made mods in mind.At its core, Sea of Stars is a single-player science fiction roguelike similar to Strange Adventures and Weird Worlds. Turn-based star map navigation is combined with a real-time combat system. The game provides a randomly generated open world for you to explore, and will only reveal a fraction of its secrets each time you play. There is no going back to a saved game - everything you do has a permanent effect. Death is frequent, but only makes you want to try again.Although Sea of Stars builds on the universe you visited in the earlier games, it is expanded with fresh new material and gameplay. Discovering the interactions between items, alien races, characters and random events will keep you busy for years - yet each session of the game is a complete adventure that you can finish in one sitting. To extend the game's longevity even further, we encourage people to make mods and even provide tools for it!One thing that has advanced since Weird Worlds is technology. I wrote a 3D engine for our previous game, Data Jammers: FastForward, and a lot of the code will now be reused to expand the Infinite Space universe into the third dimension. Other games and projects have resulted in a variety of subsystems, from procedural texturing to mundane data file handling. All kinds of fun and useful stuff.However, what will really set this game apart from its predecessors is what we are going to do within this expanded universe. The Sea of Stars will be more alive than before, both reacting to the player's actions and acting on its own. Locations like star bases will be real places with more to do than just trade items, and you may have to attack or defend one in combat. Individual NPCs as well as alien war fleets will go about their business that may or may not be aligned with your interests, and you will have to pick sides. Technology available to you as well as others will advance as time passes, including larger ships showing up.Of course, we won't forget the mod creators who helped make Weird Worlds great. Not only will all the content use standard file formats so you can use any editor of your choice, we will actually release tools to make things easier. This will ultimately evolve into a full-fledged mod editor within the game that will help you put it all together.Digital Eel is an independent game developer consisting of two guys, Iikka Keranen (programming, design, art) and Rich Carlson (audio, design, art). We have both been in the game industry since the 1990's and released a plethora of commercial titles while working on Digital Eel games on the side. Counting our video and tabletop games, Digital Eel has shipped sixteen titles. Between 2001 and his passing in 2012, we were joined by Bill \"Phosphorous\" Sears, a fellow game industry veteran and an amazing artist whose creative input will be sorely missed.Our games have won various awards, including four Independent Games Festival awards: Dr. Blob's Organism won the audio and visual art categories (2004), Weird Worlds (2006) and Brainpipe (2009) won in the audio category. Weird Worlds was also the Quest/Adventure game of the year at Game Tunnel and was nominated for the Seumas McNally grand prize at IGF.Sea of Stars will require quite a bit of content to be created, from starship models and character illustrations to music and sound effects. Without funding, it would be up to me (Iikka) and Rich to create all of it. Our estimated release date would be in the latter half of 2014, and Rich would possibly have to sell his cats to science.The good news is that there are several experienced artists as well as a great composer who have offered to work with us (Their names will be revealed when the project reaches its funding goal). With their help we can get this game done this year, and with your help we can pay them for it.When you make your pledge of $10 or more to support us, you don't just get the warm fuzzy feeling that comes from helping out an indie developer. You will also get goodies ranging from a digital copy of the game to tangible keepsakes that you will be able to pass down to your future descendants living on Gliese 581g. Check them out below.Digital copy of the game: Get Sea of Stars for PC as soon as it is released.Other Digital Eel games: At various pledge amounts we will throw in copies of our other titles, from PC games to board games. At the higher levels, your name and email address will be added to a list of customers who will receive every Digital Eel game as long as we keep making them! This is not a hollow promise; we intend to continue Digital Eel indefinitely.Beta participation: Get in the game before it hits the stores. The beta will start when the game is feature-complete but content and gameplay balance are still in development. Your feedback will influence the final product.Art prints: Receive a piece of Sea of Stars concept art or other art related to the Infinite Space universe. At higher pledge amounts, prints will be larger and more impressive. They will also be numbered and signed by the artist.Name a star or planet: Write your name among the stars! Every time someone plays the game they will be able to find at least one star and one planet named by Kickstarter backers. It could be your (last) name or a name you invented.Name a starship captain: Your name, or a name of your choice, is added to the roster of starship captain names in the game. These names may appear as the player character's name or a human NPC.Physical artifacts: Receive a solid piece of Sea of Stars memorabilia. These will be special, limited edition pieces only made for Kickstarter backers. At higher pledge amounts, the artifacts will be larger and more impressive with features such as gold plating.Create an item: Have an idea or even a sketch for a cool thing you want to find in the game? We'll work with you to create a lifeform, starship weapon, system or artifact as close to your concept as possible. One or more of these items will appear in the game each time it is played, so many people will see it!Create an event: Add your touch to the ever-changing story of Infinite Space. We will create an in-game event, mission or quest based on your idea.Appear in the game: We will create a prominent in-game character based on your photograph (yourself, a family member or friend) or sketch. The character may be a heroic space pilot, a villain, a star merchant... Our choice, but always someone you will regularly meet in the game.Design a starship or space station: We will create an in-game starship or space station based on your sketch or idea. These will be featured prominently either as ships you can command or space ports you can visit, or in a unique event or quest built around it. You will also receive a one of a kind, gold-plated metallic model of your ship or station as your \"physical artifact\".Your name in the credits: To recognize your generosity, the highest-level backers will have their names included in a special \"thank you\" section of the game's credits (you can opt out if you wish).In video game business, surprises are almost inevitable no matter how experienced you are. The largest risk is that the game could take longer to finish than expected, for example due to additional gameplay balancing required to make it more fun or to remove exploits. We don't wish to ship the game until it feels just right. If there were a significant delay, we would consider making a beta version available to all pre-purchasers in December 2013.Another possible source of delays is the amount of content required. If we missed our deadline because of unfinished content, it would be possible for us to slightly reduce the scope of the game for an initial release and then expand it in a free update. This would most likely be funded by the initial sales.Questions about this project?

      "Spelunky is an open source indie platform video game created by Derek Yu and released as freeware for Microsoft Windows. It was remade for the Xbox 360 in 2012, with ports to the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and then back to Microsoft Windows. The player controls a spelunker who explores a series of caves while collecting treasure, saving damsels, fighting enemies and dodging traps. The caves are procedurally generated, making each run through the game unique. Spelunky is one of the first examples of a roguelike-like, borrowing concepts from the roguelike genre, and was the influence for many later roguelike-like games.The first public release was on December 21, 2008. The source code of the 2008 Windows version was released on December 25, 2009. An enhanced version for Xbox Live Arcade was released on July 4, 2012. The enhanced edition was also released on PC on August 8, 2013 and for PlayStation 3 on August 27 and 28, 2013 and for PlayStation 4 on October 7, 2014. A Chrome OS version of the original game was made as well, titled Spelunky HTML5. A sequel, Spelunky 2, is set to be released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe player controls an unnamed adventurer, known as the spelunker. The aim of the game is to explore underground tunnels, gathering as much treasure as possible while avoiding traps and enemies. The spelunker can whip or jump on enemies to defeat them, pick up items that can be thrown to either attack enemies or set off traps, and use a limited supply of bombs and ropes to navigate the caves. Levels are randomly generated and grouped into four increasingly difficult \"areas\", each with a distinctive set of items, enemies, terrain types and special features. Later areas contain more valuable treasures, secret locations, and items. If the player loses all their hearts or runs into an instant-kill trap, they will have to start from the beginning.\nEnemies include animals like bats, snakes and spiders of varying sizes, other characters, and monsters like yeti, man-eating plants and ghosts. The player can collect many items, mainly gold and jewels which add to the player's score, but also useful objects including bombs, guns, climbing gear and archaeological artifacts. Some of the latter have supernatural abilities, including kapalas, hedjets, crystal skulls and golden ankhs, though many of these special items can only be gained through secret methods, like combining other items together. Some items may be purchased or stolen from shops scattered about the caves, though the shopkeepers become powerful enemies if you steal from them.\nThe player can also encounter damsels in distress trapped in the caves, who can be picked up and carried to an exit. Successfully doing so returns health to the player. It's possible to unlock the damsel as a playable character; gameplay is identical, except that the player encounters spelunkers to rescue. Another unlockable character is the \"Tunnel Man\", who possesses a mattock instead of a whip.\nThe Xbox Live Arcade, as well as the PlayStation Network versions of the game feature local multiplayer (co-op and deathmatch) for up to four players. There are 9 different characters to play as.\nThe original Spelunky also includes a level editor, in which players can create their own non-random levels to share with others.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nSpelunky was created by Derek Yu and released as freeware for Microsoft Windows on December 21, 2008. The source code of the 2008 Windows version was published under a software license permitting noncommercial distribution and modification on December 25, 2009. Based on this source code the game community created a community patch which added support for Mac OS X. Since the game source code became available community members have created many modified versions, or mods, of the original game. Most of these are available via the forums on the website for Derek Yu's video game company, Mossmouth, where a list is maintained of finished mods.\nAn enhanced remake version for Xbox Live Arcade was released on July 4, 2012. The enhanced edition was also released on PC on August 8, 2013 and for PlayStation 3 on August 27 and 28, 2013.\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nSpelunky draws from La-Mulana, Rick Dangerous, and Spelunker for its visual styling, character design, gameplay elements and general mechanics. Essentially a dungeon crawl, it also adds elements from the roguelike genre, including randomly generated levels, a lack of save points, frequent and easy death, and discovery mechanics. It draws equally from the 2D platformer genre, including real-time interactions with enemies. According to Yu, the Super Mario series of video games was one of the game's biggest inspirations, especially in \"feel and physics.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIGN gave the XBLA version a score of 9.0 and an Editor's Choice award, calling it \"a superb 2D platformer that's as easy to hate as it is to love.\" GamesRadar gave the game 5/5, praising its gameplay and constant sense of discovery. GameTrailers gave the game a score of 8.3, praising its design but criticising some control quirks and throwaway multiplayer. 1UP.com gave the game an A ranking, saying \"it offers the same immediate, pick-up-and-play fun of Geometry Wars, but demands much more than the simple reflexive reactions of your lizard brain.\"PC Gamer UK chose the remake of Spelunky as its 2013 game of the year. Eurogamer ranked Spelunky third on its Games of the Generation list. In 2015, Rock, Paper, Shotgun ranked the original Spelunky 1st on its The 50 Best Free Games On PC list. A difficult challenge run of Spelunky HD, known as an \"eggplant run\", was reported on by various video game news websites.\nThe spelunker, the main character of Spelunky, is one of several indie game characters who can be unlocked and played in Super Meat Boy. Referred to as \"Spelunky\" in Super Meat Boy, the character has the special power of explosive jumps (referencing the bombs he carries in the original game), and he is exclusive to the Xbox Live Arcade version. He also makes an appearance in Bit.Trip Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien as a DLC character.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\"Spelunky\". The A.V.

      "SourcePCG: There’s a section in the book called ‘feedback loop’ where you write that Spelunky was a small idea that quickly grew organically. That seems like an ideal situation for a creative person. Is that a hard phenomenon to trigger? Do you work for it, or does it arrive in a fit of inspiration?DY: You definitely have to put in the work. Start with small ideas and try making them. What I found is that I’d often hit a wall, so I’d go back and think about what I’m going to do again, find a new idea, mix and match some existing ideas I’ve already had and go back at it. You hit a wall, and then you hit another, and eventually you get to an idea where everything seems to fit and you just start flying.That’s kinda how it was with Spelunky: I had all these prototypes before Spelunky, and they were all really exciting at the start but pretty soon you hit a wall. Once I started working on Spelunky I never hit the wall, I just kept going and going, and there kept being more interesting avenues to explore with it. I don’t think I would have just come across it without working on the previous prototypes, which meant sitting down and making games. I definitely advocate actually making games, getting your hands dirty, because that’s the only way to really figure out what sticks. There are so many ideas that sound good in your head, but when you start working on them they aren’t [that good].PCG: Spelunky’s Deathmatch mode is one of my favourite competitive games. You write in the book that you were surprised people didn’t pick it up more. Why do you think they didn’t?DY: It’s a good question. I think it was because people just didn’t play it the way Andy [Hull, Spelunky programmer] and I did while we were developing it, where it was just much more tactical. We didn’t chuck bombs all over the place, we’d wait for that perfect opportunity and try to take out the person when they were vulnerable. Whereas I think most people who tried deathmatch, and maybe multiplayer in general – especially for a game like Spelunky where the deathmatch was never really a part of the core game to begin with – I think expectation played quite a big part. I feel like that’s on us, to get players to understand how to “play the game” properly. I definitely don’t blame the players or anything like that. I think a lot of people do have a lot of fun with it, as a more casual thing. It may also be that adventure mode is more compelling than deathmatch mode.PCG: We’ve got a tournament going in the office. We play 1v1, 12 bombs, 4 ropes, and everything else on default except the ghost, target and AI is toggled off. We find it very tactical with those settings.DY: It’s possible that there are people out there having a lot of fun with deathmatch and it’s just not really being broadcast on the internet where I would be able to find out. I tend not to watch a lot of Spelunky streaming anyways, kinda for the same reason I don’t play it: it’s just slightly stressful for me. I usually just watch the highlights people send me. I think it’s also the case that deathmatch isn’t a very well-explained mode. It’s just there and it’s up to you to figure out what to do with it.PCG: There have been some impressive Spelunky runs: someone killed the ghost, someone got the eggplant to Yama, recently there was a no gold pacifist run. It feels like the community has done everything in this game, but is there any other devious challenge you could set?DY: Oh boy. I don’t think there is! Nothing that’s really within reason. I joked about people playing it blindfolded but I don’t really suggest that, actually. I don’t think Spelunky has enough audio cues to let you do that without a tonne of luck. I said it in the book: people have already completely surpassed our expectations in terms of what can be done in the game. The limits of the game, or what we thought were the limits, aren’t the limits at all – they’ve been surpassed by people like Bananasaurus Rex. At this point anything people do is new and surprising to us.PCG: Did you expect Spelunky to be such a great spectator sport?DY: I didn’t, though I hoped that it would. With Spelunky Classic, I really thought the random nature of the game would limit it as a competitive game, but it’s not been a problem at all – if anything the random nature has made it more exciting for speedrunners and challenge runners. Someone released a speedrun of the original Spelunky and broke down exactly what they were thinking at each spot, and talked about how they used the randomisation to their advantage, how they accounted for the randomisation. There is such a thing as increasing your luck with the randomisation by doing certain things, and that gave me hope that Spelunky would be pretty competitive, despite or because of the randomisation that’s involved in it.PCG: You begin to have an innate feel for how the levels are constructed after a while.DY: That’s the thing that I didn’t necessarily know would be true, working on the game. I think I had a certain intuition about it too, it just seems to work because despite the randomisation it’s not complete chaos. There’s enough in Spelunky that’s handmade versus random or procedurally generated that from run to run, you never see the exact same formations, but you find familiar ones.PCG: I’ve found in my time playing Spelunky that the Black Market is the easiest place to kill the shopkeepers, thanks to the Ankh room. It’s very easy to lob bombs safely down there. Was that deliberate?DY: It wasn’t deliberate but it’s one of those things where I quickly realised that it’s easy to get them there. I didn’t plan it that way per se, it’s just one of those things where it happened to work out, which was the case for a lot of Spelunky. Intuitively I design things a certain way without understanding necessarily why I was doing it that way, but after playing it or having other people play it and watching other people play it, I kinda understood why I did it. As I’m working on a game, I don’t necessarily have these strict ideas in mind, it’s more like feelings. It’s why you have to make a lot of games and spend a lot of time doing it, to build up that intuition. Then I think making games feels more like drawing, which also feels more right and satisfying, and you feel like you’re putting more of yourself into it. It’s better than thinking in terms of nitty-gritty design rules.PCG: I know that Spelunky is feature complete and you’ve moved on, but is there any potential to get Steam Workshop support for it? There are third-party map creation tools out there.DY: To be honest I haven’t thought too much about it. Andy Hull (programmer for Steam + Xbox) would have to want to do it. I’m certainly cool with people using editors and stuff to mod the game with, but I don’t know about Steam Workshop – there would have to be a lot of demand for us to go and muck around in that code again. At this point we’re pretty happy to move on.PCG: Are you working on something at the moment?DY: Yeah, we’re working on a few different things, but unfortunately nothing is far enough along that I can really reveal what it is. The book has taken up a lot of my time during the past year, or over a year. Now that’s winding down I’m spending more time on games again.PCG: Are you working alone on the prototyping and conception?DY: A little bit. It’s hard to say that I’m in solitude now because I have a daughter, so I feel like I’m never alone anymore. I’m also working with other people on things. I’m doing a little bit of the totally solo prototyping which I did when working on Spelunky, but it’s definitely not the same. So much is different now. One is that, like I said in the book, Spelunky really kind of came about because of Aquaria in a way, because I wanted something that was different from Aquaria. That was such a difficult development for me and Alec Holowka [co-creator of Aquaria], so I really needed to decompress and make something very small. I don’t feel that as much with what I’m working on now, because Spelunky, even though every game development is very challenging, I think the development of Spelunky was a challenge that was much less exhausting for me on a mental and spiritual level.PCG: What games are you playing at the moment?DY: I haven’t been playing as many games as I have in the past. Mostly I’ve been playing smaller indie games and mobile titles, because those are the ones that fit my lifestyle more now. Being a parent, I spend a lot of time parenting and when I have free time I want to work, and so my time for playing video games is a lot more limited. I have to sneak it in. Most of last year I played a tonne of Puzzle & Dragons. I think a lot of people saw me Tweeting about that, and thought “why are you playing that?” It’s actually a really good game. It’s quite rewarding in terms of requiring a pretty high level of skill to master and all that. There’s a lot of variety and the fundamental mechanics of the game are very interesting, it’s an extremely innovative extension on basic match three mechanics. I don’t play it as much now, but last year I played it a lot.Other than that I’ve mostly been trying smaller games out. Though I was playing The Witness for quite a bit. That’s the thing, longer form games I have trouble with because I’ll enter a period where I can’t play it much and it’s hard to get back into. What I played of the Witness was really good.PCG: Who’s your favourite Spelunky character?DY: You know, I think I usually just play as the Spelunky guy, the main character. I actually like the little purple girl with the glasses.PCG: She’s my favourite, too!DY: I also like the purple pirate girl. There’s something about purple. Usually I play as Spelunky guy, though. But I do like the underdog characters, I like to play the more interesting or underused ones. I used to play Ken in Street Fighter 2 a lot, but I moved to Dudley in Street Fighter 4 because he was a much more interesting and underused character.Spelunky by Derek Yu is available through Boss Fight Books on March 29, in both digital and physical editions.

      "Okay, for those not in the know: what the hell is Spelunky?Spelunky is a platformer where every level is randomly-generated. So each time you play you get a new layout and a new adventure. The game was inspired by roguelike games, which are meant to be played many times. As such, there's a lot to discover and many ways to interact with your environment. You start with a supply of bombs, so you can even blow up the terrain.The goal is to find the ultimate treasure at the bottom of the caves and end the game with as much money as possible so you can brag to your friends or make new ones, even!And the game' s been available for free online for a while, hasn't it...Yeah! I released the freeware version in 2008, just for fun. From there it took off!What was the decision behind bringing it to XBLA now?Jonathan Blow, the creator of Braid, became a fan of the game and suggested that I put it on XBLA. He even put me in touch with Microsoft so I could pitch the idea to them. That guy's been really generous with his time... you can tell he's very invested in supporting indie games and generally making the world a better place, which is super-cool.I'll do my best to pay it forward.And what sort of tweaks and changes are you making to it?The upgrade to the graphics and music are the most obvious change, but we're also putting a lot of effort into smoothing out the controls and interface. I want to make the game really polished so that people can get to exploring the game as quickly as possible. And speaking of exploring... we'll definitely be adding new EVERYTHING to the caves, including monsters, traps, and level types. There will be plenty of stuff in there that veterans of the original Spelunky have never seen.Is there anything new you can tell us/show us of the game's XBLA version?Sure, here's a new screenshot from the game, showcasing the jetpack and shotgun you'll use.How many of you are on the creative team?Right now it's three of us. Me, my friend Andy Hull, who's doing design and coding, and Eirik \"Phlogiston\" Surhke, who's working on music. Andy is a former toy designer who I've known for over 10 years, when we met in the Klik n' Play community. Eirik has composed music for a lot of indie games, and runs Pause Music, a label for indie music and chiptunes.How did this all start originally? What was the original thinking behind Spelunky?I had just finished Aquaria with my buddy Alec Holowka and I wanted to make a little freeware game to relax. I made a few prototypes for platformers and roguelikes before I realized it might be a good idea to combine ideas from both genres and make a platform game that could be played hundreds or thousands of times without getting bored. What really tied the idea together, though, was the bombs and ropes - with these tools the player wouldn't be constrained to a single path. It made level generation a lot easier because I wouldn't have to worry about players getting stuck as much, and could add areas that were completely closed off.And what' s your background in the game development field?I started out in the Klik community, making games with Clickteam's Klik n' Play and Multimedia Fusion programs. The way I make games now is not so different from when I was a kid, actually. The only differences are that the tools have gotten better, the communities have gotten bigger, and there are more channels to get your games out to people. It's amazing to me that you can release a freeware game today and there's a chance it will become an XBLA title!It's received a lot of praise from all quarters - Team Meat seem to love the game. How's that feel?It feels great! Especially because it was so unexpected. You always hope that people will enjoy the same things you do, but it's hard to know. As a developer you always brace yourself for disappointment, so when people you really respect tell you you did something good, it gives you a lot of validation.Even criticism is great - it shows you that people care enough about your work to write something. I try to remember that when I'm online and give people good feedback whenever I can.How do you design a game where the dungeons/cave combinations are unlimited?You just have to add enough elements to the game that can be changed each time you play! In Spelunky, not only are the cave layouts randomized, but the placement of monsters, traps, treasure, and items are randomized. But just having a large number of combinations is not enough - you want the levels to feel \"purposeful\". The more it feels like a hand-created level, the better.Thoughts on a PSN/Wii/3DS version?I probably won't be releasing the game for PSN or Wii any time soon. A handheld version of the game would be cool, but I'm more interested in releasing a PC version first. Even though I'm really excited to be working on my first console game, I love PC gaming and am very grateful to the fans of the original game. In a just world they'd get to play the new game on PC at some point (no promises about when that will be).What' s next for you?Finish the game! But beyond Spelunky, I'd like to return to making new freeware, which is the most fun for me. It's also the best place to test out my new ideas. And I need to get back into traditional art, like drawing and painting. I'm getting too comfortable with Photoshop!What, to you, are the foundations that make the ultimate 2D game?Cool game world and characters, well-balanced challenge, and lots of variety. Oh, and great art and music!What titles are you most hyped for this year?I'm pretty hyped for Fez, which is coming out for XBLA. And I'll be very interested to see where Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft will be in a year. Both those games are already available to play, but are also in constant development.As far as mainstream games go, all my hyped games are sequels: Duke Nukem Forever, Mortal Kombat, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and Diablo 3. I actually don't mind playing sequels at all. Part of it is the nostalgia-factor, of course, but it's also fun to see how a series evolves over the years. Video game development is a highly iterative process.Any recommendations for free online titles (aside from your own) that we should play?I already mentioned Dwarf Fortress. It's the most complex simulation I've ever played, and it's incredibly interesting just to read about. The stories that come out of playing the game rival most pre-scripted fantasy narratives, in my opinion.If you like classic horizontal shoot 'em ups, try out Hydorah - it's a real labor of love. If you want to play a great puzzle game, play Desktop Dungeons - it's got randomly-generated levels like Spelunky and it's great fun.Finally, if you're looking for something a bit different and you're a fan of the surreal, try the RPG Space Funeral. There are a lot of great freeware games out there!",
      "Wednesday, Jul 17, 2013Link | iTunesIndieGames.com is presented by the UBM TechWeb Game Network, which runs the Independent Games Festival & Summit every year at Game Developers Conference. The company (producer of the Game Developers Conference series, Gamasutra.com and Game Developer magazine) established the Independent Games Festival in 1998 to encourage innovation in game development and to recognize the best independent game developers.Read MoreMarch  1, 2011  9:00 PM | Tim W.Spelunky began as a freeware roguelike platformer for the PC, but has evolved into a larger-scale XBLA title due out this year. \"When I think about how that happened, how I started with this tiny little game, and it became something much larger, I'm still pretty amazed,\" said Derek Yu, the game's creator.Before making Spelunky, he had wrapped up a large project. \"I really wanted to work on something a lot lighter,\" said Yu, \"something small and kind of fluffy. It's kind of ironic because Spelunky's now turned into kind of a monster.\"To get there, he made a lot of small games in between the bigger ones. \"When I think about it, all those small games I made turned into something bigger,\" he said. \"They gradually got bigger, and that got me the confidence to do something better.\"Yu considers the freeware version of Spelunky to be a prototype for the XBLA version. He likens prototyping to drawing. \"The key is really to zone in on what I'm enjoying at the time, and things I'm interested in,\" he said, adding that tools like gamemaker and unity \"are the equivalent of a sketchbook for me, because they help me get my ideas out as quickly as possible.\"Spelunky came about because he was prototyping a roguelike and a platformer simultaneously, and with both of them he \"really didn't get very far,\" he said. \"I came up with the idea of combining the aspects of roguelikes that I liked and found compelling. I wanted to combine that with a platform game.\"\"I wanted to make something that was new and exciting, but also accessible,\" he added, saying that with procedural content, \"you can create a lot of content with a small team.\" Spelunky's levels are randomly generated from a set of specific room-types, but with additional randomization within them. \"It's really fun to work this way, because you're always surprised by your own game.\"Yu is a big believer in the idea of prototyping game ideas. \"Chris Hecker, who I know loves to be quoted out of context, described games that don't reach their full potential as mulch, and games that do, as trees,\" Yu said. \"I really liked that idea, and thought you could make mulch and trees at the same time.\"Andy Hull, programmer on the XBLA version of Spelunky, said that they're treating the game as more of a sequel to the original version. \"This might be scary to hear, but you can't be afraid to change things from the original game,\" he said. \"This was made easier by the fact that the original game will still exist.\"The most important thing in the new version, aside from the new art, is the streamlined interface. \"When I first played Spelunky I didn't stick with it for very long, because I had some difficulty with the controls,\" said Hull. It wasn't until he saw how much people liked it on TIGSource that he went back to it.Previously going to the shop keeper was difficult, with multiple button presses required to purchase items, and the possibility of accidentally angering the shopkeeper. So they streamlined it, and now buying items requires a single button press.One feature that was more requested than any other, and that's multiplayer. When they announced four-player local play for the XBLA version, the audience erupted into applause.\"The freeware game acted as our design document for the XBLA game,\" Hull concluded. \"Spelunky really shows that there's more benefit to releasing these [prototype] games than people realize.\"Tags: gdc,spelunkyCategories: \n              \n              ConsoleconsoleFor indies self-publishing on PlayStation 4, here's what to expect-July 17, 2013  1:15 PMSuper Trailer: Capy's Super Time Force still looks good going forward (and backward)-July 16, 2013  9:59 PMFive PR tips indies really need -July 16, 2013 10:50 AMVideo: 'Broken' game design -

      "At this year’s Game Developers Conference, I gave a 30-minute talk with my friend Andy Hull about Spelunky and how it went from being a freeware PC game to the XBLA project that we’re both working on right now. Overall, I think the talk went quite well (whew)! You can find footage of the talk somewhere on GDC Vault, but unfortunately, you have to be a registered member of something or another to view it, so I provided the slides here, with some extra commentary.I gave the first half of the talk. Pretty accurate drawing of me, aside from the sweat! All of my flop sweating over public speaking is internal.A screenshot from the freeware version of the game.I wanted to show here how important the smaller games (on the left) were in terms of how they made the bigger games (on the right) possible. For example, Alec Holowka found me through I’m O.K. and we started working on Aquaria soon after. Not that I don’t think they’re fun games in their own right, of course. Just small.Spelunky XBLA is being built on top of the original Spelunky, which itself was built on top of smaller, unfinished prototypes. When I prototype games, I follow a process that’s similar to how I develop a comic or illustration. After I put down enough doodles, the themes and ideas that are interesting to me start to emerge.I’ve been a fan of roguelikes since I found the MS-DOS port of Hack on a floppy disk my parents kept from graduate school. These are a couple of screenshots from a simple roguelike I started working on after Aquaria.Some of the reasons why roguelikes are amazing but also relatively unpopular, in my opinion.I love platform games, natch.While I was working on my roguelike game, I would take a break and started a few platformers that didn’t get anywhere. However, you can see that some of the graphics from these prototypes made their way into Spelunky.The idea was to combine the pick-up-and-play, instant gratification of a fun platformer with the variety of a roguelike. I wanted the basic interactions in the game to be simple and few, but allow for a lot of improvisation. And I wanted there to be a lot of chances to improvise.To extrapolate the last bullet point, there are some challenges with randomized platform level design that are smoothed over by the implementation of destructible terrain and climbing tools. Plus, caves! Putting your game in a cave is a great excuse to make nonsensical but interesting levels, hehe.I briefly went over the level generation in Spelunky here. First, each level is divided into a grid of 16 rooms.A path is drawn from the entrance of the level at the top, to the exit of the level at the bottom.Each room is selected from a set of room templates. Which set it’s selected from depends on where the room lies on the path from the entrance to the exit.There are randomized “chunks” in each room template that add some variation.Finally, I add the critters, traps, treasures, and other fun stuff! There are some other things to consider (for example, the placement of special rooms), but that’s the basic idea.Generating things algorithmically has its upsides. You can’t develop levels that are as good as hand-made levels, but it’s exciting to run around in a dungeon that you know no one else has ever seen or will ever see again. Plus, when you get yourself out of a bind, it really feels like a miracle!I brought up three examples where people released small projects or “refined prototypes” to great success. Super Meat Boy came from the Flash game Meat Boy, Google has Google Labs, and Haruki Murakami writes short stories between each novel1.I quoted Spore/Spy Party developer Chris Hecker out of context here, but it was for a good reason! The quote is from an Edge Magazine interview with him and Jon, and it goes:And I stated that I like the analogy, but even though many developers choose to be one or the other, I feel that you can be a mulch and tree person both, to great success.Here’s where Andy took over (and yes, he really does have two belly buttons - or at least, one belly button and one thing that looks like a belly button). Andy is doing a bit of everything, but mostly programming. I’ve known him for almost half my life, but this is the first time we’ve ever collaborated on something! He’s a great all-around talent to work with, and a super-nice dude, to boot.A screenshot from the XBLA version of the game.Jon Blow was the one who suggested putting Spelunky on Xbox 360, and after I went “Hmmm… hell yeah!”, he was generous enough to put me in touch with the producer at Microsoft who worked with him on Braid. From there, the game was evaluated by an XBLA team and the rest, as they say, is history!What can I say? Jon is a supremely cool dude and it always feels good when supremely cool dudes take an interest in your game.I don’t see any downsides to polishing up a promising prototype and releasing it as a small game. There’s no way that Jon Blow, Microsoft, or anyone else would have taken an interest in Spelunky if I hadn’t released the original version. A finished game is worth so much.Jon was also kind enough to lend us his Braid engine, as we were such green Xbox developers. We used it for a few months before deciding that, in this particular case, creating our own engine would be a better idea. It was still very helpful as a reference.All-in-all, we didn’t lose too much time to our new engine, and it’s made development smoother once we got back up to speed. There’s definitely a time and a place to roll your own code. Also, I’d personally rather that Jon spend his time working on The Witness than do tech support for us, wouldn’t you agree?The original game is great, but what excited me about Spelunky XBLA was the chance to expand upon the original and try new things. It’s not a true sequel, but it’s also not a remake or port. This segues nicely into a rundown of some of the updates we’re making to the basic game:This comparison image is quite fun to look at. It’s an interesting process to riff off your own artwork like this. There’s all of the fun of re-imagining something without the guilty feeling of being unoriginal! Not that a little explorer-man in a cave is all that original, but you catch my drift.I have a great time doing both pixel art and high-res art - another reason to keep playing with Game Maker in between commercial projects! Now I just need to learn 3d…The interface in the original game was not as smooth as it could have been. A lot of interactions require more button presses than necessary. For example, to buy an item in the original game, you had to pick the item up, which required two button presses, and then hit another button to buy the item. In Spelunky XBLA, you can stand in front of the item and just hit “RB”.We teased some new stuff here! The high-resolution artwork lends itself to a bigger world, with more goodies to play with. And so it shall be!At the end, we made the announcement that Spelunky XBLA will feature co-op multiplayer (offline), although we didn’t go into detail about what other modes will be offered. This was a feature that was requested heavily for the original game, but never made it in due to the amount of work that would be involved. We’ve been developing the XBLA game with it in mind, however.We’re happy with how it’s turning out. Let’s just say that 4x the players = 4x the shenanigans…One of the central themes of our talk was how important it has been for us to have the original Spelunky game out there. As someone who has come to think of his creative life in terms of his larger (2+ year) game projects, I still can’t stress the importance of the smaller releases and how they influenced me. There’s no reason why you cannot work on epic games and fill the time between with smaller projects. They scratch different types of itches2.And that’s the end of the talk! Hope you enjoyed it.1 Murakami explains this process in the introduction to Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman, a collection of his short stories.2 In this video interview with Shinji Mikami, the creator of Resident Evil and the founder of Platinum Games, he expresses his interest in making “all kinds of different small games” (0:46).",

      "“The creative mind mind is like a big pile of jigsaw puzzle pieces. Some pieces were made by other people–inspirational words of advice, an intriguing screenshot from a game you’ve never heard of, a haunting melody–and some are gained through life experiences. Some pieces are already connected either because they came that way or because while you were walking down the street or taking a shower they somehow found each other. Sometimes a single piece is missing, and once that piece is uncovered, two other pieces from other ends of the pile can finally be connected.”The most recent edition to the Boss Fight Books catalog is “Spelunky” by Derek Yu. Interestingly, this is the first Boss Fight book written by the developer of the game being written about. Not only did Yu (along with Andy Hull) help create Spelunky (the game), Yu wrote a book about his experience when he was creating the game.As one would expect from a book written by a creator of a game about that game, much of “Spelunky” discusses Yu’s experience of how Spelunky was created. Yu talks about his childhood exposure to video games such as the original Legend of Zelda, to how the concept of a roguelike platform came to fruition, and the experience of working on Spelunky with Hull. This books is important to anyone and everyone who cares about video games. If you’re a distinguished developer, you should read this book. If you’re an aspiring game maker, you should read this book. If you play video games and care enough to learn about them, you should read this book.“Spelunky” has so many unique facets that even if I could discuss them in a review, I don’t think I would want to as to not spoil the book. Yu’s writing is so charming and light-hearted that after reading his book you’d already feel like he was one of your good friends. Moreover, regardless of your opinion of the game, it’s hard not to sympathize with Yu and Hull when they were creating Spelunky. If you enjoyed Indie Game: The Movie you would really enjoy this book, as both have a similar flavor: indie developers who try to inflict their mark on the world with their creative vision face countless obstacles when creating their games. If you care about the development histories behind various indie games composed of only a few people, “Spelunky” is one hell of a good book.If you’re not a game developer, but really enjoy video games, I would still recommend “Spelunky.” Reading a book on how games are created makes you appreciate video games in a new light based on the technological and developmental difficulties developers faced when creating games. You think less like “This level is dumb because it’s hard” and more “I see why they made this level difficult because…” So even if you’re not a developer, but really enjoy video games, give “Spelunky” a read–it’ll definitely alter how you look at video games.I’ve read most of the Boss Fight Books catalog, and this would have to be in my top 3 of their books (I also heavily recommend “Bible Adventures” by Gabe Durham). Seriously, these books are so damn good. If you care about video game literature, you should really check these guys out!Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )You are commenting using your Google+ account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )You are commenting using your Twitter account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )You are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )Connecting to %sNotify me of new comments via email.derpythecalamity on Why you should read: Super Mar…Alyse Knorr on Why you should read: Super Mar…derpythecalamity on Why you should read: Super Mar…Alyse Knorr on Why you should read: Super Mar…",
      "Spelunky is a roguelike platformer game for Windows, made in Game Maker, in which the player is meant to grab all the loot they can while surviving the perilous environment.The game is made up of a series of randomly generated levels, in which the player must get from the top of the level down to an exit stairway on the bottom.

    "text": [
      "The Binding of Isaac (Hebrew: עֲקֵידַת יִצְחַק‎ Aqedat Yitzhaq, in Hebrew also simply \"The Binding\", הָעֲקֵידָה  Ha-Aqedah) is a story from the Hebrew Bible found in Genesis 22. In the biblical narrative, God asks Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac, on Moriah. Abraham begins to comply, when a messenger from God interrupts him. Abraham then sees a ram and sacrifices it instead.\nThis episode has been the focus of a great deal of commentary in traditional Jewish, Christian, and Muslim sources, as well as being addressed by modern scholarship.\n\n\n== Biblical narrative ==\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, God commands Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice.[Gen 22:2-8] After Isaac is bound to an altar, a messenger from God  stops Abraham at the last minute, saying \"now I know you fear God.\"  Abraham looks up and sees a ram and sacrifices it instead of Isaac. \n\nThe passage states that the event occurred at \"the mount of the LORD\" in \"the land of Moriah.\" 2 Chronicles 3:1 refers to \"mount Moriah\" as the site of Solomon's Temple, while Psalms 24:3; Isaiah 2:3 & 30:29; and Zechariah 8:3 use the term \"the mount of the LORD\" to refer to the site of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, the location believed to be the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.\n\n\n== Jewish views ==\n\nThe majority of Jewish religious commentators argue that God was testing Abraham to see if he would actually kill his own son, as a test of his loyalty. However, a number of Jewish Biblical commentators from the medieval era, and many in the modern era, read the text in another way.The early rabbinic midrash Genesis Rabbah imagines God as saying \"I never considered telling Abraham to slaughter Isaac (using the Hebrew\nroot letters for \"slaughter\", not \"sacrifice\")\". Rabbi Yona Ibn Janach (Spain, 11th century) wrote that God demanded only a symbolic sacrifice. Rabbi Yosef Ibn Caspi (Spain, early 14th century) wrote that Abraham's \"imagination\" led him astray, making him believe that he had been commanded to sacrifice his son. Ibn Caspi writes \"How could God command such a revolting thing?\" However, according to Joseph Hertz, Chief Rabbi of the British Empire, child sacrifice was actually \"rife among the Semitic peoples\", and he suggests that \"in that age, it was astounding that Abraham's God should have interposed to prevent the sacrifice, not that He should have asked for it.\" Hertz interprets the Akedah as demonstrating to the Jews that human sacrifice is abhorrent.In The Binding of Isaac, Religious Murders & Kabbalah, Lippman Bodoff argues that Abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son, and that he had faith that God had no intention that he do so. Rabbi Ari Kahn (on the Orthodox Union website) elaborates this view as follows: Isaac's death was never a possibility — not as far as Abraham was concerned, and not as far as God was concerned. God’s commandment to Abraham was very specific, and Abraham understood it very precisely: Isaac was to be \"raised up as an offering\", and God would use the opportunity to teach humankind, once and for all, that human sacrifice, child sacrifice, is not acceptable. This is precisely how the sages of the Talmud (Taanit 4a) understood the Akedah. Citing the Prophet Jeremiah’s exhortation against child sacrifice (Chapter 19), they state unequivocally that such behavior \"never crossed God’s mind\", referring specifically to the sacrificial slaughter of Isaac. Though readers of this parashah throughout the generations have been disturbed, even horrified, by the Akeida, there was no miscommunication between God and Abraham. The thought of actually killing Isaac never crossed their minds.Others suggest that Abraham's apparent complicity with the sacrifice was actually his way of testing God. Abraham had previously argued with God to save lives in Sodom and Gomorrah. By silently complying with God's instructions to kill Isaac, Abraham was putting pressure on God to act in a moral way to preserve life. More evidence that Abraham thought that he would not actually sacrifice Isaac comes from Genesis 22:5, where Abraham said to his servants, \"You stay here with the ass. The boy and I will go up there; we will worship and we will return to you.\" By saying we (as opposed to I), he meant that both he and Isaac would return. Thus, he did not believe that Isaac would be sacrificed in the end.In The Guide for the Perplexed, Maimonides argues that the story of the Binding of Isaac contains two \"great notions\". First, Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac demonstrates the limit of humanity's capability to both love and fear God. Second, because Abraham acted on a prophetic vision of what God had asked him to do, the story exemplifies how prophetic revelation has the same truth value as philosophical argument and thus carries equal certainty, notwithstanding the fact that it comes in a dream or vision.In Glory and Agony: Isaac's Sacrifice and National Narrative, Yael S. Feldman argues that the story of Isaac's Binding, in both its biblical and post-biblical versions (the New Testament included) has had a great impact on the ethos of altruist heroism and self-sacrifice in modern Hebrew national culture. As her study demonstrates, over the last century the \"Binding of Isaac\" has morphed into the \"Sacrifice of Isaac\", connoting both the glory and agony of heroic death on the battlefield.In Legends of the Jews, rabbi Louis Ginzberg argues that the binding of Isaac is a way of God to test Isaac's claim to Ishmael, and to silence Satan's protest about Abraham who had not brought up any offering to God after Isaac was born, also to show a proof to the world that Abraham is the true god-fearing man who ready to fulfill any God's commands, even to sacrifice his own son:\n\nWhen God commanded the father to desist from sacrificing Isaac, Abraham said: \"One man tempts another, because he knoweth not what is in the heart of his neighbor. But Thou surely didst know that I was ready to sacrifice my son!\"God: \"It was manifest to Me, and I foreknew it, that thou wouldst withhold not even thy soul from Me.\"Abraham: \"And why, then, didst Thou afflict me thus?\"God: \"It was My wish that the world should become acquainted with thee, and should know that it is not without good reason that I have chosen thee from all the nations. Now it hath been witnessed unto men that thou fearest God.\"\n\nThe Book of Genesis does not tell the age of Isaac at the time. Some Talmudic sages teach that Isaac was an adult in his age of thirty seven, likely based on the next biblical story, which is of Sarah's death at 127 years[Genesis 23:1], being 90 when Isaac was born[Genesis 17:17, 21]. Isaac's reaction to the binding is unstated in the biblical narrative. Some commentators have argued that he was traumatized and angry, often citing the fact that he and Abraham are never seen to speak to each other again; however, Jon D. Levenson notes that they never speak before the binding, either.\n\n\n== Christian views ==\n\nThe Binding of Isaac is mentioned in the New Testament Epistle to the Hebrews among many acts of faith recorded in the Old Testament: \"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, 'In Isaac your seed shall be called,' concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.\" (Hebrews 11:17–19, NKJV)\nAbraham's faith in God is such that he felt God would be able to resurrect the slain Isaac, in order that his prophecy (Genesis 21:12) might be fulfilled. Early Christian preaching sometimes accepted Jewish interpretations of the binding of Isaac without elaborating. For example, Hippolytus of Rome says in his Commentary on the Song of Songs, \"The blessed Isaac became desirous of the anointing and he wished to sacrifice himself for the sake of the world\" (On the Song 2:15). Other Christians from the period saw Isaac as a type of the \"Word of God\" who prefigured Christ. The majority of Christian Biblical commentators view this episode as prefiguring God's plan to have his own Son, Jesus, die on the cross as a substitute for humanity, much like the ram God provided for Abraham. This fulfilled Abraham's reply to Isaac's question of where was the animal that would be used for the sacrifice; Abraham's affirmation that \"God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering\" is seen as a prophetic foreshadow of the promise of the Lamb of God. Abraham's willingness to give up his own son Isaac is seen, in this view, as foreshadowing the willingness of God the Father to sacrifice his Son; also contrasted is Isaac's submission in the whole ordeal with Christ's, the two choosing to lay down their own lives in order for the will of God to be accomplished, as no struggle is mentioned in the Genesis account.\n\n\n== Muslim views ==\n\nThe version in the Quran differs from that in Genesis. \nIn Islamic sources, when Abraham tells his son about the vision, his son accepted to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of God's command, and no binding to the altar occurred. The Quran states that when Abraham asked for a righteous son, God granted him a son possessing forbearance. When the son was able to walk and work with him, Abraham saw a vision about sacrificing his son, Ishmael. When he told his son about it, his son agreed to fulfill the command of God in the vision. When they both had submitted their will to God and were ready for the sacrifice, God told Abraham he had fulfilled the vision, and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead. God promised to reward Abraham. The next two verses state God also granted Abraham the righteous son Isaac and promised more rewards.Among early Muslim scholars, however, there was a dispute over the identity of the son. The argument of those early scholars who believed it was Isaac rather than Ishmael (notably ibn Qutaybah and al-Tabari) was that \"God's perfecting his mercy on Abraham and Isaac\" referred to his making Abraham his friend, and to his rescuing Isaac. On the contrary, the other parties held that the promise to Sarah was of a son, Isaac, and a grandson, Jacob (Sura 11:71–74) excluded the possibility of a premature death of Isaac.\nAnd it has become the mainstream Muslim view that it was the first-born son Ismail, not Isaac, who was asked to be sacrificed in the vision, and that the second son Isaac was born later as one of the rewards for Abraham's fulfillment of his vision.The submission of Abraham and his son is celebrated and commemorated by Muslims on the days of Eid al-Adha. During the festival, those who can afford and the ones in the pilgrimage sacrifice a ram, cow, sheep or a camel. Part of the sacrifice meat is eaten by the household and remaining is distributed to the neighbors and the needy. The festival marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.\nIn Islam, the site of al-Marwah near the Kaaba is identified with the Moriah mentioned in the Book of Genesis.\n\n\n== Modern research ==\n\n\n=== Redactors and narrative purpose ===\nModern scholars operating under the framework of the documentary hypothesis commonly ascribe the Binding's narrative to the biblical source E, on the grounds that it generally uses the specific term Elohim (אלוהים) and parallels characteristic E compositions. On that view, the second angelic appearance to Abraham (v. 14–18), praising his obedience and blessing his offspring, is in fact a later Jahwist interpolation to E’s original account (v. 1–13, 19). This is supported by the style and composition of these verses, as well as by the use of the name Yahweh for the deity.In Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, the literary critic Erich Auerbach considers the Hebrew narrative of the Binding of Isaac, along with Homer's description of Odysseus's scar, as the two paradigmatic models for the representation of reality in literature. Auerbach contrasts Homer's attention to detail and foregrounding of the spatial, historical, as well as personal contexts for events to the Bible's sparse account, in which virtually all context is kept in the background or left outside of the narrative. As Auerbach observes, this narrative strategy virtually compels readers to add their own interpretations to the text.\n\n\n=== Ethical responsibility ===\nMore recent studies question the analysis of E and J as strictly separate. Coats argues that Abraham’s obedience to God’s command in fact necessitates praise and blessing, which he only receives in the second angelic speech. That speech, therefore, could not have been simply inserted into E’s original account. This has suggested to many that the author responsible for the interpolation of the second angelic appearance has left his mark also on the original account (v. 1–13, 19).More recently it has been suggested that these traces are in fact the first angelic appearance (v. 11–12), in which the Angel of YHWH stops Abraham before he kills Isaac. The style and composition of these verses resemble that of the second angelic speech, and YHWH is used for the deity rather than God. On that reading, in the original E version of the Binding Abraham disobeys God’s command, sacrificing the ram \"instead of his son\" (v. 13) on his own responsibility and without being stopped by an angel: \"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son; but Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and beheld, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went, and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son\" (v. 10, 13).\nBy interpolating the first appearance of the angel, a later redactor shifted responsibility for halting the test from Abraham to the angel (v. 11–12). The second angelic appearance, in which Abraham is rewarded for his obedience (v. 14–18), became necessary due to that shift of responsibility. This analysis of the story sheds light on the connection between the Binding and the story of Sodom (Genesis 18), in which Abraham protests against God's unethical plan to destroy the city, without distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked: \"Far be it from you to do such a thing: Shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just?\" Abraham's ethical rebellion against God in the destruction of Sodom culminates in his disobedience to God, refusing to sacrifice Isaac.The Binding also figures prominently in the writings of several of the more important modern theologians, such as Søren Kierkegaard in Fear and Trembling and Shalom Spiegel in The Last Trial. Jewish communities regularly review this literature, for instance the recent mock trial held by more than 600 members of the University Synagogue of Orange County, California. Derrida also looks at the story of the sacrifice as well as Kierkegaard’s reading in The Gift of Death.\n\n\n=== Possible child sacrifice ===\n\nFrancesca Stavrakopoulou has speculated that it is possible that the story \"contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac. R.E. Friedman argued that in the original E story, Abraham may have carried out the sacrifice of Isaac, but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of JE to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for Isaac. Likewise, Terence Fretheim wrote that the text bears no specific mark of being a polemic against child sacrifice.Some scholars also point at the genealogical snippet (verses 20–24) as containing a hint to the question whether Abraham sacrificed Isaac or not.\n\nFirst of all, the description of a rash of newborns placed right after the main story suggests the existence of some direct cause-effect connection between the two. From the perspective of a sacrificial economy, such a numerous progeny could not have been conceived without the preceding payment in an appropriate ‘currency’.Secondly, the said passage is problematic due to its onomastic content. The verses 20–23 list the progeny of Nahor and Milkah while v. 24 adds the offspring conceived with Re’umah, said to be his concubine.However, whereas verses 20–23 have some significant links with other parts of the Hebrew Bible as well as with the historical and cultural entourage of the ancient Near East, such connections are absent in v. 24. The very name of Nahor’s concubine appears here exclusively and in no other place in the Hebrew Bible is Re’umah mentioned. The same applies to her children’s names with the exception of Ma‘akah which is sometimes utilized in the historical books. The extreme rarity of these appellations demands some alternative interpretation with regards to its purpose.\nAccordingly, the personal list may contain some \"coded\" explanation concerning the rest of the story:\n\nRe’umah (ראומה) – \"see what\"\nTevah (טבח) – \"slaughtering\" or \"slaughtered\"\nGaham (גחם) – \"flame\" or \"burning\"\nTahash (תחש) – \"skin\" often used to describe the tabernacle’s covering\nMa‘akah (מעכה) – \"blown\" or \"crushed\"In other words, v. 24 begins with an interpretational invitation and continues with the names which seem to explain the cause of the rash of newborns present at the conclusion of the pericope: Somebody had been blown, slaughtered, put on the tabernacle, and burned.\n\n\n=== Rite of Passage ===\nIt has been suggested that Genesis 22 contains an intrusion of the liturgy of a rite of passage, including mock sacrifice, as commonly found in early and preliterate societies, marking the passage from youth to adulthood.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSymposium on the Sacrifice of Isaac in the Three Monotheistic Religions\nThe Sacrifice of Isaac in Medieval English Drama\nMystery play texts in the cycles from Chester, Wakefield, York and n-Town\nShofar Callin' (G-dcast's animated retelling of the Binding of Isaac, to a hip hop soundtrack)",

      "By\nAnthony McGlynn\n2018-06-06T01:31:10.156ZOn April 30, the last official add-on scheduled for The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ was released. Booster Pack #5 contained 'The Forgotten' and a treasure trove of bits and bobs, including \"White Poop, a new poop type.\" It's been quiet since then. For the first time since the original incarnation of the randomly generated gross-out dungeon crawler was released in 2011, it seems like Isaac may finally get to rest.At least, in game-form. \"There's a lot of little things I want to add and that I really want to explore with the IP that I haven't been able to because I've been mostly just working on the game,\" Binding of Isaac co-creator Edmund McMillen tells me. \"Without revealing too much information, yeah, there's stuff on the horizon.\"Isaac and he have now been together for the bulk of a decade, a period that's seen all kinds of change in the games industry and in his personal life. Isaac's come to symbolize the kind of auteur-driven success many enter the medium to obtain, with the kind of longevity major publishers fall over themselves to replicate. And it all started with a two-week game-jam.Wanting to take a vacation post-2010's Super Meat Boy, McMillen chose to stay home and make a quick passion project with friend Florian Himsl as a way to unwind. Two weeks gradually became three months, and friends started telling them they should consider making the thing into a proper release. \"It was just one of those situations where everything clicked together and it was too hard to put down, but I also didn't see any means of actually selling it,\" McMillen says, \"because at the time it was Flash and I didn't think Steam would be interested or even allow Flash games on Steam.\"Indie distribution was still finding its feet, and they considered simply selling the IP to someone like Adult Swim for a big down payment. However, encouragement from those in the know pushed McMillen to overcome his assumptions and reach out to his contact at Valve to see if Steam would give Isaac a look. Thankfully, they did, and soon Isaac was available to the world.But back then Isaac was a very leftfield piece of work. Nowadays its core elements are common, but in 2011 the response was muted. Review scores were decent, but nobody really seemed to get what was really on. \"They just kinda put it aside, it was a lot of 'oh it's like a remix of Legend of Zelda, and it's pretty cool,'\" McMillen says. \"It was like, OK, well, I don't know how I'm supposed to sell this thing.\"It wasn't until Let's Plays latched onto the game that things started to snowball. Hours of videos demonstrating the ever-changing longplay aspect of Isaac on YouTube generated a sudden spike in interest. McMillen remains at a loss as to why people enjoy watching it, but the benefits were quick and significant. \"100-200 copies, 1,000 copies a day—that summer, the first summer after release, which was probably nine months after release, is when it just exploded, and it just kept climbing higher and higher and higher.\"Little did he know that a steadfast community was forming, and that it would prove integral to Isaac's longevity. Ryder Hicks, owner of The Modding of Isaac, was one of them. \"I had some friends on Steam that were playing it and I was like 'What is this?' and I watched the trailer and it was very bizarre,\" he says. \"And I was like 'all right I gotta try this' and it was amazing.\"The Modding of Isaac is a community forum for fanmade Isaac creations. Through the 2014 remake The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and beyond, modding it has become easier and easier, drawing in more creators. Hicks had run a modded Team Fortress 2 server for years, and wanted to help this community grow in the same way, working to preserve mods and encourage their creators. \"It's so easy to mod and add stuff that you think might be interesting,\" he says. \"If you're like, able to theme it in properly, you can make it some pretty cool stuff by yourself, not really having to put in a whole lot of work.\"The modding scene blindsided McMillen, but has since become vital to The Binding of Isaac. The-Vinh Truong, aka '_Kilburn', now an integral Isaac team-member, began as lead designer on one of the biggest mods, Anti-Birth. \"Initially I didn't want it to be anything too big, just a few items and enemies, and then Afterbirth came out and we hadn't finished our mod yet,\" Truong says of Anti-Birth. \"But we saw what that added and thought maybe we could use this as an opportunity to show what we could do.\"Anti-Birth is a testament to how inspirational Binding of Isaac has been. It's a massive slab of new stuff, containing intuitive bosses and clever items built by Truong and his friends in their spare time. During our interview, McMillen can barely restrain himself from singing the modder's praises, going so far as to call him the best collaborator he's ever had. \"There's a lot of great modders out there, but he's on a whole other level,\" McMillen says enthusiastically. \"I feel like he understands me in a way that I'm not completely aware of yet.\" Truong is considerably more modest: \"[People] don't always get what the game is supposed to be like. I'm not going to pretend that I do, but I try. I guess I do my best.\"At this stage, McMillen is very aware of the crossroads facing Isaac. The free updates were becoming more and more elaborate, and the question of a sequel has been looming. The additions contained by Booster Packs were starting to make their way uncomfortably close to his list of ideas for a sequel. Ending the updates now is as much about putting a formal follow-up into perspective as anything else.\"When people ask what would you do to improve the game, there's a bunch of stuff that I would do. And I probably say that the first thing that I would do is strip out the story bosses,\" he says, on the subject of possibilities for number two. \"Like, after you get to a certain point in the game, no more story bosses. No Mom, no Satan, all those dead-end bosses. Then I would design bosses that are more difficult and randomize them into those slots, and then you'd have a more random experience. That's where I'm heading just for a base level design for a sequel.\"The current game is now at a critical mass, as he puts it, and any more big additions would require uprooting the carpet and taking down the upholstery. It would require another re-design, when a blank slate with new foundations makes more sense. After the troubled development of Afterbirth+, during which Edmund was absent for four months due to personal issues, he's keen to make sure everything they put out is as consistent and worthwhile as possible.Though he loves The Binding of Isaac and loves working on it, it eventually became work. After several years of various ups and downs professionally and personally, McMillen was ready to quit games and take his life elsewhere, a feeling he dealt with in a familiar way—by making a game about it. \"The End Is Nigh was by far the most cathartic experience I'd ever had,\" McMillen says of his macabre 2017 platformer. \"I was ready to be done with games. I just wasn't getting what I have gotten out of it. I just had a bunch of terrible experiences when it comes to designing and working with people.\"Formed from the husk of previously announced but unfinished Ouroboros, The End Is Nigh let him really ponder if everything had been worth it. It's a story of perseverance by any means, challenging you to find the motivation to try again and again, without the promise of a happy ending. Thematically, it was his toughest undertaking, and he considers it one of the best games he's made.Right now, McMillen is seeing where the wind takes him. Later this year there's Legend of Bum-bo, a Binding of Isaac prequel, and he mentions a desire to release smaller, weirder games in the future. After nearly quitting two years ago, now he sounds optimistic, no doubt bolstered by having Vinh around to riff ideas with and Ryder's site collecting together Isaac's ardent fans. But whatever comes next, he's resolute that the ending of Binding of Isaac has already happened.\"The Forgotten in itself is the final ending of the game. You loosely see that Isaac's bones have his soul chained to the ground because of how he died,\" he explains. \"It puts into question what happened and why, and where is he now. In the story of the game, that is its conclusion, and I don't see myself adding any more to that.\"Subscribe to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

      "Poppy is a proofreader and Dragon Age fan. She lives in Tokyo and has two hamsters named Zelda and Hemingway.The Binding of Isaac (2011) is an indie game created by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl, that found huge success on the PC platform Steam, and has been the talking point of many gamers since its release.  This article will briefly explain the plotline and the various theories put forward to interpret Isaac's world, items, monsters, and bosses.The Binding of Isaac's introduction is based off the Bible story of the same name. Isaac and his mother live alone together; he keeps to himself, playing with toys and his games console whilst his mother watches Christian broadcasts on TV. One day she hears the voice of God telling her that Isaac has become corrupted and needs to be saved. This happens three times, where his mother:Isaac finds a trapdoor in his bedroom and escapes down it, away from his mother - and the game begins.The basement consists of several floors, each with various items, enemies and rooms, and all with some kind of boss before Isaac can descend to the next floor. The game is very similar to the old game boy version of The Legend of Zelda, where McMillen could have got some of his ideas from.The game was cartoony; Isaac's 'weapon' to defeat enemies were his tears, and moved around naked and crying. Enemies were often covered in blood, screaming or groaning, or represented some kind of pain or suffering. The bosses seemed to translate to something deeper than just something scary that needed to be defeated. The game itself is brilliant, and I still enjoy playing it today - but there is always the creeping sense of dread as I'm playing it, as if there are darker adult themes behind the simplistic cartoon. I've played this game for about a year or more, and have come up with various theories and interpretations which I will apply to this article.Wikipedia says that the game \"touches on dark, adult themes including child abuse, gender identity, infanticide, neglect, suicide, abortion, and how religion might negatively affect a child; all concepts which video games generally avoid.\"Firstly, the world itself. Isaac explores a seemingly endless basement, which is similar to the dungeons in \"The Legend of Zelda\". There are three possibilities that the basement represents:There are various monsters in the basement who Isaac has to defeat to move onto the next room, and items that he can collect.All of the above suggest that Isaac suffers some kind of abuse and fear in his life - from his mother, it seems, as they live alone, and other children. Maybe this is the reason that Isaac \"keeps to himself\".It was difficult to tell whether gender identity was actually explored in the Binding of Isaac, or it was just because Isaac is a small child. However, upon further playthrough, I did notice some reasons why Wikipedia could have suggested this.The theory that Isaac could be actually hiding in the basement to escape his angry mother can be applied here.The bosses seemed to have some kind of reference to Isaac's fears, taking shape of things he might have heard or seen in his life. Here are some theories I came up with.A lot of the enemies and items refer to religion.All of these hidden meanings and possible interpretations, together with Isaac's crying and the game's music, I always get a feeling of sadness when playing this game.  McMillen did an excellent job of creating an entirely original plot, characters and enemies that made for a thought-provoking experience.  I give Binding of Isaac four stars out of five.Â© 2014 PoppyTo comment on this article, you must sign in or sign up and post using a HubPages Network account.Hi Eric! Thank you for commenting. It’s a great game for sure!The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is one of my favorite computer games. Nice article.  I also wondered a bit about the story and meaning of it.Great article! The Binding of Isaac is my favourite indie game and once I was also very interested in the plot of the game and I studied much of the content but your hub also had some new information for me :)Ps: If you are interested, there is a review on my Hubpage to Isaac: Rebirth ^^Thank you for your comment.  I agree, the Silent Hill games were also really powerful by showing you the minimal amount of details.  With horror I really believe less is more.These are very interesting insights. This game is indeed very dark and unsettling. In a way it reminds me of the early Silent Hill games (the first two), where the horror elements where not what you could see, but the ideas the images generated in your own mind.Copyright © 2018 HubPages Inc. and respective owners.

      "The Binding of Isaac was released seven years ago. Its last major update for the foreseeable future was just released, and Edmund McMillen, its creator, may be ready to walk away.“It’s hard to be done with the game, but, as of right now …”He pauses. It amounts to just a couple of seconds, but it feels longer. This is common. A designer sees monumental success from a single project, but after a few years, they pull themselves away from it. That success becomes a creative burden, poisoning everything else they work on.McMillen continues.“No, I’m never done.”Originally designed in Flash, The Binding of Isaac has since been updated and released on around a dozen platforms, with millions of copies sold.The basic premise: A boy named Isaac is locked in the basement of his home by his mother. There, he must survive an unending wave of horrors that are probably just representations of his own psychosis. The core gameplay, though, is fairly traditional. Really it’s just a shooter with original Zelda DNA mixed in.And yet people have spent an astonishingly long amount of time playing it. A Steam review, written in April 2018 by user AmSnek, lists the reviewer’s play time at 1,572.6 hours. Almost all of the reviews listed are from people who have played for more than 100 hours. When The Binding of Isaac grabs you, it does so without mercy.It’s this fanbase that has kept McMillen so engaged with the project. Over the last year he’s been working with his team on free updates to the latest version of the game, The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth Plus. These updates were almost entirely conceived by The Binding of Isaac’s community, released as free mods and eventually added to the full version of the game for everyone to experience.The idea for these updates, called Booster Packs, was simple: “What if people make really cool stuff and we can put it officially in the game? It would encourage people to make cooler stuff because there was a chance for it to be in the game,” McMillen said in an interview with Polygon.The execution of this plan proved more complicated, though.“There were definitely a bunch of issues that I hadn’t foreseen at all. I simply didn’t have a great technical understanding of how this would all go down,” he said. “And we only had one person, Adrian [Gavrilita], who was the lead programmer on Afterbirth Plus. So it ended up taking a lot longer than I thought.”In addition to rebalancing some of the fan-made items, there was artwork to clean up and programming issues to work around. The first three Booster Packs were released over the course of four months in 2017, which was relatively on schedule.For the fourth and fifth packs, McMillen enlisted a team of modders behind Antibirth, a popular fan mod that added dozens of new mechanics to Isaac.“Antibirth had come out, like, a month or two before Afterbirth Plus. I right away got in contact with Vinh, who was the lead designer and programmer for the whole project. He has such a great mind for Isaac-related things,” said McMillen.These final two packs, the last of the Boosters for The Binding of Isaac, are ambitious and easily on par with traditional paid downloadable content. The most recent pack added an entirely new playable character, designed by McMillen. “I always wanted to include one item from me on each of these packs,” he explained.In describing these packs, McMillen did sound like he was trying to atone for his lack of involvement in the initial release of Afterbirth Plus.“Afterbirth Plus was developed at a time where I wasn’t really available to develop,” he said. “It was a fucked-up situation. A lot of stuff in my personal life, I wasn’t able to be there and guide things as much as I wanted to. [...] I don’t want to say ‘right any wrongs,’ because I don’t think it was a complete disaster, but … I just wish I was there more.”In a blog post in 2011, McMillen described his original plans for Isaac. He specifically called out having “70 special items,” “8 dungeons” and “42 enemy types.” At launch, there were six playable characters.Today, with the latest Boosters, the total number of possible pick-ups in Isaac has surpassed 700, with 15 playable characters.“It is designed in a way that allows for a hugely bloated amount of content,” said McMillen. “The more you go, though, the more dangerous things become. Because even though it’s organized chaos, you have to balance the chaos a little bit. You get into a situation where the shell that you initially built this thing in is falling apart, and you’re just taping it together.”The chaos from all of the possible item combinations and gameplay implications is only part of what makes The Binding of Isaac a thrilling project for McMillen to work on.The game’s story, mostly told through unvoiced cutscenes, between-level cinematics and other nontraditional means, continues to be a driving focus for McMillen.Back in 2015, he launched an ARG that encouraged the community to work together to unlock a new character in the game. Using a mix of voicemails, missing-child flyers and coded messages designed to be uncovered by fans, McMillen was able to convey elements of the Isaac storyline in bizarre new ways. The ARG culminated with a gang of six Reddit users uncovering GPS coordinates and heading out to Santa Cruz, California. They were told by McMillen to “bring a shovel.” The end result was a buried statue of one of the game’s boss characters, Greed, which directed fans to a secret Twitter account that encouraged people to “give him a voice” by posting a message there. The game was then updated, adding a new playable character, The Keeper, to its roster.“It wasn’t something I was being paid to do,” McMillen said of the ARG. “I wasn’t making money off of it, but I got to do it to interact with the community and utilize something that I made to expand it in a nontraditional way.”The fifth Booster Pack’s largest secret, a new playable character named The Forgotten, is McMillen’s follow-up to the ARG.The Forgotten is a skeletal version of Isaac who is able to switch between a physical, bony form and a ghostlike form that’s chained down.“One day, I’d like to do a sequel to The Binding of Isaac,” he said. “There are certain elements of the game’s design that I would want to hold for a sequel. Because I don’t want to introduce whole new mechanics. I would have to rewrite the game; that would change everything.”So rather than start from scratch, McMillen has been dropping pieces of what he’d view as a sequel into the core game. The Forgotten is one such example. McMillen describes it as “thematically more appropriate for a sequel.”“I want to do some abstract storytelling with a character,” said McMillen. “Just some themes. I want the player to play as a skeletal character, whose soul is chained to it, and I want that to speak more than a cutscene. […] It was, like, a fun way to basically say, ‘Isaac’s body still exists and its soul can’t leave because it hasn’t been buried on hallowed ground. His soul is stuck.’ […] It opens a lot of different ways to tell the story, different pathways to go. That’s where I wanted to go in the future.“The stages of decay — from Blue Baby to The Lost to The Keeper to The Forgotten — it’s all part of a story that I’m trying to tell through characters and themes. Where can I take this? Where do I want to go? How much more do I want to push, and how much do I want to save for something bigger in the future?”But before he looks to the future of Isaac, McMillen is going to look into the past.His next game is The Legend of Bum-bo, scheduled for release this year. Like most of McMillen’s stuff, it’s a bit bizarre. Bum-bo is a prequel, set before the events of The Binding of Isaac, but in the same universe. While familiar characters (like Bum-bo himself) appear, the gameplay is a major departure from that of Isaac.“I’m sure that people who like Isaac will like Bum-bo,” explained McMillen, “but it’s a strategy game. It’s a totally different type of experience. It’s more relaxed and more of a thinker’s game than a run-and-gun type.”The Legend of Bum-bo has more in common with Bejeweled than Smash TV, but with a layer of tactical combat mixed in with match-three mechanics. At one point, McMillen referenced “action points” in the game, saying that’s something players might connect to an RPG like Fallout.At first glance, Bum-bo seems a lot sweeter and more child-friendly than much of McMillen’s work. His hand-drawn artwork is brought to life by his programmer, James Id, to create lively 3D worlds within the confines of a cardboard box.“With James, the thing that we have in common — outside of movies and being weirdos — is that we had difficult childhoods,” McMillen said. “And it was appropriate to the story to explore elements that feel true to us. A lot of the stuff in Bum-bo is reminiscent of being poor but being a creative kid, so you had to utilize the stuff around you. Making cardboard spaceships. Cardboard boxes are a huge theme in almost all my games, and now it’s almost looped back in on itself, and it’s a game within a cardboard box.”This theme of finding ways to conquer a tough situation is a through-line in most of McMillen’s work. “It’s a piece of me. It’s such an honest chunk of my life,” he said. “As an artist you just open up, and allow life and time to just inspire things. My best projects are like that. The End Is Nigh was like that. Shitty situation. How do I write about an awful situation, and how do I take that and turn it into something that can be enjoyed?”“Art in general has always been very therapeutic and honest to me. I tried to write poetry as a teenager and it was, like, horrid — the most embarrassing shit you could imagine. And I found that over the years, I can write poetry through video games, and I can express myself in a way that people don’t get. And they don’t get enough to make it embarrassing, if that makes sense.”",

      "A classic shooter RPG online game with a supernatural and familial discourse themeThe Binding of Isaac is a unique fast-paced RPG where you have to save a small child from certain death.The premise of this game is quite brutal but the gameplay more than makes up for it. The game begins with the player taking control of the protagonist, Isaac, whose mother has been commanded by God to sacrifice to prove her faith.Isaac doesn’t want to die so he escapes into the basement, and that's where the game begins.In the basement you’ll find monstrous cast-off siblings, jealous enemies, powerful items that’ll help you on your journey as well as procedurally generated levels that make the game different each time you play.What really makes this game stand out is that the developer combined such adult themes with cutesy pixel graphics, it’s the perfect recipe for disarming players and creating a truly immersive experience.If you’re looking for an interesting game that’s never the same twice, you’ll want to give this one a try – just remember that this is definitely not a game you should give young children!ProsConsImproved team-based gameplay with new characters, bigger maps, custom skins, better weapons and user modificationsSandbox physics mod for Half-Life 2 that became so popular that it was made into a standalone releaseCrime pays more with every challenging heist scenario plus new customizable weapons and character masksThe action-packed fifth main installment in a world-renowned series, complete with single player and multiplayer modesno thanks",

      "its for real, its fun and its isaac… seriously one of my most fun designs to date and i cant wait for fans to play it!spread the word as much as you can, leave no isaac fan uninformed!!!xoxoisisaacdead:The End is Nigh! is out on Steam!BUY IT NOW!YourEndIsNigh.com————————-after a solid 7 months of dev, the end is nigh is finally finished and available for your consumption. this sprawling stress fest was a blast to work on and something im personally very proud of, i really hope you all like it as much as we do!now, a few fun facts…-The End is Nigh is actually the 3rd game Tyler and i have released, we first teamed up to make Aether 9 years ago and then released AVGM less than a year later. Tyler was also the lead programmer for The Basement Collection, a best of set of revamped “directors cuts” of my early works.-The End is Nigh is loosely based on my experience designing and releasing video games.-The End is Nigh run off a custom designed game engine Tyler made that was being used for 0uroboros ( a game that inspired the end is nigh ).-The End is Nigh features well over 600 levels, this was the first platformer ive worked on where i got to share the design work, Tyler ended up designing all of the games secret areas, making them feel more unique. the slight change in design style is one of the more subtle but interesting aspects of the games design that i really love.-The End is Nigh features a full classical OST completely redone by Ridiculon (binding of isaac) to fit the games mood and theme.-Rich Evans of Red Letter Media does all the voice work for the games protagonist Ash.Enjoy!-Edmund(ps got so caught up on the release and being filmed again that i totaly forgot to set this blog post live on launch day :| oops)The End is Nigh can now be preordered on steam at a 10% discount… but if you own The Binding of Isaac (rebirth or original), Closure or Bombernauts you’ll get an extra 10% off! (because you are so loyal!) 20% off!!! OMG!for those unaware The End is Nigh is my next big project that Tyler Glaiel and i have been working on since last year in secret! its a (very challenging) sprawling adventure platformer, packed to the brim with hard to reach collectibles, mini games and tons of places to explore!The End is Nigh is coming to Steam July 12th, Switch sometime later… and maybe more consoles? who knows!?some of you may have missed our live at e3 stream of The End, well dont worry because this footage is much better! it shows some of chapter 1 (The End) and finishes inside the mouth of “something from the future”.we also spoiled some music from the game, above is Overflow (chapter 3) and The Wall of Sorrow.More news about the amazing OST next week!stay tuned!Coming to steam july 12th ( switch + possibly more consoles later )http://store.steampowered.com/app/583470/The_End_Is_Nigh/a game by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel.  music by Ridiculon voiced by Rich Evanstitle screen by  Alex Pardeeretro titles by Matt Kap Trailer by James IdThe End Is Nigh is a sprawling adventure platformer where the player takes control over Ash, one of few “things” that have “survived” the “end of the world”.Follow Ash as he flops his way through a future of pain and suffering. Feel his stress levels rise as you throw him into an endless swarm of decaying, mutant animal-like creatures and help aid his final epic quest… to simply make a friend (out of pieces of people he finds along his journey).Oh, also you collect video game cartridges and tumors! if that does anything for ya.Features:I’m extremely proud to announce that Tyler and I finally finished something! After months of working in secret I can now say that our game is called The End is Nigh and it will be releasing on Steam, July 12th (in 5 weeks!).A little back story….In September of last year Tyler and I announced that we were working on a new game called 0uroboros, a platforming shooter with randomly generated environments. after a year of working on it, it felt 10% done. In order to avoid it becoming another mewgenics, we needed to figure out how to refocus it before it grows out of hand.while working on 0uroboros we would take small breaks to prototype a few other ideas, but it wasn’t till December that we actually sat down and decided to do a full game jam and see what would come out. within a week what we had was a completely stripped down platformer with an adventure game “open” feel where the levels were all locked into tidy little boxes but attached in a way where they could be explored… it felt a bit like VVVVVV meets 1001 Spikes with a Spelunky control setup and it felt perfect.once again what started as a 2 week mini project sprawled into, by far, the largest game (level wise) I’ve ever worked on. I’m extremely proud of what we’ve accomplished with this game, it embodies aspects of basically every game I’ve ever created and I’m super excited to see what you guys think.and now a little QA to clear up some frequently asked questions:Q: is this the Steven game?A: well it’s not 0urboros, but themes from it did bleed a great deal into it… you could say that in a way The End was a continuation of themes that i explored in Time Fcuk and 0uroboros… Steven is the glue that holds all my games together!Q: so does this mean 0uroboros is dead?A: not at all! I’m positive 0uroboros will eventually see a release, we just need some time away from platforming for a bit.Q: why didn’t you announce this game sooner?A: because i have way too many projects that I’ve announced become vaporware shortly after announcing and I’m sick of it, from now on I’m only going to announce stuff a month or two before release.Q: what happened to bum-bo?A: The Legend of Bum-bo is still very much in dev and scheduled to release this year in December.Q: are you you working on any other projects currently?A: no, just bum-bo for the rest of the year (and i guess isaac booster packs).Q: do you like me?A: no!legendfbumbo:it was interestingi did these polls as a weird social art project based on weird questions that came up in my group of friends.they were fun to do and i actually learned a bit from it.i kinda wish i didnt answer them all though, but it was the most suggested thing people were bothering me about with each poll, so i thought id be honest.anyway, dont judge me asshole!catstyler made me do this poll!yes.. it wasnt a sex toytissue ball all the way",

      "Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house on a hill. Isaac kept to himself, drawing pictures and playing with his toys as his mom watched Christian broadcasts on the television.\nLife was simple, and they were both happy.\nThat was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice from above: \"Your son has become corrupted by sin! He needs to be saved!\"\n\n\"I will do my best to save him, my Lord,\" Isaac's mother replied, rushing into Isaac's room, removing all that was evil from his life.\n\nAgain, the voice called to her:\n\"Isaac's soul is still corrupt! He needs to be cut off from all that is evil in this world and confess his sins.\"\n\n\"I will follow your instructions, Lord. I have faith in thee,\" Isaac's mother replied, as she locked Isaac away in his room, away from the evils of the world.\n\nOne last time, Isaac's mom heard the voice of God calling to her:\n\"You have done as I asked, but I still question your devotion to me. To prove your faith, I will ask one more thing of you.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lord. Anything,\" Isaac's mother begged.\n\n\"To prove your love and devotion, I require a sacrifice. Your son Isaac will be this sacrifice. Go into his room and end his life as an offering to me, to prove that you love me above all else!\"\n\n\"Yes, Lord,\" she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.\nIsaac, watching through a crack in the door, trembled in fear. Scrambling around his room to find a hiding place, he noticed a trapdoor to the basement, hidden under his rug. Without hesitation, he flung open the hatch just as his mother burst through his door and threw himself down into the unknown depths below.Hey İts good!!!!!"

    "title": "FTL: Faster Than Light",
    "text": [
      "FTL: Faster Than Light is a space-based top-down real-time strategy roguelike game created by indie developer Subset Games, which was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in September 2012. In the game, the player controls the crew of a single spacecraft, holding critical information to be delivered to an allied fleet, while being pursued by a large rebel fleet. The player must guide the spacecraft over eight sectors, each with planetary systems and events procedurally generated in a roguelike fashion, while facing rebel and other hostile forces, recruiting new crew, and outfitting and upgrading their ship. Combat takes place in pausable real time, and if the ship is destroyed or all of its crew lost, the game ends, forcing the player to restart with a new ship.\nThe concept for FTL was based on tabletop board games and other non-strategic space combat video games that required the player to manage an array of ship's functions. The initial development by the two-man Subset Games was self-funded, and guided towards developing entries for various indie game competitions. With positive responses from the players and judges at these events, Subset opted to engage in a crowd-sourced Kickstarter campaign to finish the title, and succeeded in obtaining twenty times more than they had sought; the extra funds were used towards more professional art, music and in-game writing.\nThe game, considered one of the major successes of the Kickstarter fundraisers for video games, was released in September 2012 to positive reviews. An updated version, FTL: Advanced Edition, added additional ships, events, and other gameplay elements, and was released in April 2014 as a free update for existing owners and was put up for purchase on iPad devices. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's creativity. FTL is recognized alongside games like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac that helped popularize indie \"roguelike-like\" games that use some but not all of the principles of a classical roguelike.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe player controls a spacecraft capable of traveling faster-than-light (FTL). It belongs to the Galactic Federation, which is on the verge of collapse after losing a war with an exclusively human rebel faction. The player's crew intercepts a data packet from the rebel fleet containing information that could throw the rebels into disarray and ensure a Federation victory. The goal is to reach Federation headquarters, waiting several space sectors away, while avoiding destruction from hostile ships or by the pursuing rebel fleet. The final sector ends with a battle against the Rebel Flagship, a multi-stage fight which results in victory or defeat for the Federation.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nAt game start, the player chooses a spacecraft with several specific systems rooms (piloting, engines, weapons, life support, etc.), and a crew. The game randomly generates eight space sectors similar to roguelike games, with twenty-some waypoints per sector. The player must \"jump\" the ship between waypoints, normally unaware what awaits at each point, and make headway to an \"exit\" point leading to the next sector until the Federation is reached. The player’s ship accumulates currency, additional crew, equipment, ship enhancements, but also damage to ship and crew, by maximizing the number of waypoints (and hence events/other ships) visited per sector.  The player can revisit waypoints, but each warp jump consumes fuel and causes the rebel fleet to advance in each sector, and slowly take over more of the beacons. Once a beacon is taken over, jumping to the beacon will result in an encounter with a rebel cruiser, and will only ever grant the player one piece of fuel as a reward for defeating the ship. Encounters are more dangerous, and give better rewards, in later sectors of the game.\nThere are eight different races of species in the game. These races can both be acquired by the player, and fought against on an enemy ship. The eight races are Humans, Engi, Zoltan, Mantis, Rock, Slug, Lanius, and Crystal. Each of the races have different strengths and weaknesses based on their physiology. For example, the Rock race are more resistant to damage and fire, but are slower than other races.\n\nWaypoints may include stores that offer ship systems, fuel, ammunition, weapons, drones, crew recruits, and hull repairs for a certain amount of scrap (in-game currency). Other waypoints may appear as distress calls from stranded ships or traps set by rebels or pirates (A ship that has been taken over by a hostile group.). Certain destinations are hazardous to the ship or ship functions: asteroid belts continually pelt ships, nebulae disable sensors, and flares from red giant stars cause fires. Hostile ships often attack the player and must either be destroyed or fought until they offer to surrender, evaded by \"jumping\" away, or destroyed. During battles, the game becomes a real-time space combat simulator in which the player can pause the game for situation evaluation and command input.\nIn combat, the player can manage the ship's systems by distributing power, order crew to specific stations or rooms to repair damage, and fire weapons at the enemy ship. Successful weapon strikes by either side can damage systems, disabling their functions until repaired by crew; cause hull breaches that vent air into space until patched by crew; ignite fires that spread and damage both systems and the hull until they are extinguished by crew or starved of oxygen; and inflict direct hull damage, which reduces the ship's hull points. A ship is destroyed once its hull points are reduced to zero, or defeated once its crew is eliminated. A player victory earns resources for bartering, upgrading, or combat; an enemy victory results in game failure, deleting the save file and forcing the player to start over, creating a high level of difficulty. Alternatively, the player may evade combat by jumping to another waypoint after the ship's engines have fully charged; occasionally hostile ships may likewise escape the player.\nThe game begins with a single available ship, the Kestrel-class cruiser in default “A” configuration. Nine further ships, one for each of seven non-human races and two additional human Federation ships, are unlocked by completing various optional objectives. All ships have two additional layouts (except Crystal and Lanius, with one each) — different color schemes, equipment, and crew — that can be unlocked by completing base-layout objectives. Each ship design and layout begin focus on different game play aspects: the ship roster has designs emphasizing stealth cloaking, boarding, drone systems, and other variations. The game also has separate achievements with no gameplay impact. The game can be modified by the user to alter the various ship configurations.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nFTL is the product of the two-man team of Subset Games, Matthew Davis and Justin Ma. Both were employees of 2K Games's Shanghai studio, and became friends during their tenure there, playing various board games in their free time. Ma, who considered himself a jack-of-all-trades, had become dissatisfied with working in a larger studio, and after traveling to the 2011 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco and seeing the Independent Games Festival, he realized he wanted to become an independent developer. Davis had left 2K Games early in 2011, and after biking through China, returned and joined Ma, who had also recently quit, and began working on the core FTL game. They agreed they would spend a year towards development and if their efforts did not pan out, they would go on to other things. Following the success of the game, the pair began work on their second game, Into the Breach.\nThe idea for FTL was inspired by tabletop board games, such as Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, and non-strategic video games, such as Star Wars: X-Wing, where the player would have to route power to available systems to best manage the situation. Davis also stated that some of the influences for the game from TV shows and movies included Star Trek, Firefly and Star Wars. Unlike most space combat simulation games, \"the initial concept was as simple as wanting to put the player in the commander's chair instead of the pilot's\", according to Davis, and to make \"the player feel like they were Captain Picard yelling at engineers to get the shields back online\", as stated by Ma. The intent of the game was to make it feel like a \"suicide mission\", and had adjusted the various elements of the game to anticipate a 10% success rate. They looked to Super Meat Boy as an example of a game designed \"to be hard, but not frustrating\", according to Ma, noting that there were almost no barriers to the player restarting after a failed attempt; they developed the restarting process for FTL to be similarly easy. However, they also considered that each loss was a learning experience for the player, gaining knowledge of what battles to engage in and when to avoid or abandon unwinnable fights. The permanence of a gameplay mistake was a critical element they wanted to include, and gameplay features such as permadeath emphasized this approach.Their preliminary versions used primitive art assets to allow them to focus on the game. This helped them to realize that they were trying to help the player become invested in the characters they controlled, allowing their imagination to fill in what their graphics at the time could not. Only as they neared the August 2011 Game Developers Conference in China after about six months of work, where they planned to submit FTL as part of the Independent Games Festival there, did they start focusing on the game's art. The game was named as a finalist at the IGF China competition, leading to initial media exposure for the game. PC Gamer magazine offered an early preview of the game that created more media interest in time for the Independent Games Festival at the March 2012 Games Developer Conference. The OnLive cloud-based gaming service included FTL and other Independent Games Festival finalists for several weeks around the conference. At the Festival, FTL was nominated for, though did not win, the Grand Prize and the Excellent in Design award; these accolades further helped spark interest in the game. Davis considered that the game's involvement in these competitions were important to keep the game's development on a forward schedule, as judges and members of the press would be expecting playable prototypes of the completed title. He believed that the publicity of being a part of these competitions, even if not as a nominated title, helped to garner interest in FTL by the larger public.Subset Games had initially planned to work on the title for about a three-month period after saving enough of their own money to cover expenses for about a year. The additional attention to the game forced them to extend development – what would be a two-year process – and thus they turned to Kickstarter in order to fund the final polish of the game as well as costs associated to its release, seeking a total funding goal of $10,000. Their Kickstarter approach was considered well-timed, riding on the coattails of the highly successful Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter in March 2012, as well as gaining the attention of top developers like Ken Levine and Markus Persson; with interest spurred in crowd-funded games, Subset games was able to raise over $200,000 through the effort. FTL represents one of the first games to come out from this surge in crowd-funded games, and demonstrates that such funding mechanisms can support video game development.With the larger funding, Subset considered the benefit of adding more features at the cost of extending the game's release schedule. They opted to make some small improvements on the game, with only a one-month release delay from their planned schedule, and stated they would use the remaining Kickstarter funds for future project development. The additional funds allowed them to pay for licensing fees of middleware libraries and applications to improve the game's performance. Additionally, they were able to outsource other game assets; in particular additional writing and world design was provided by Tom Jubert (Penumbra, Driver: San Francisco), while music was composed by Ben Prunty. Prunty was introduced to Subset through another game developer, Anton Mikhailov, that was a common friend to both Prunty and Davis. Prunty was already ready to provide Subset with some music tracks prior to the Kickstarter, but with its success, they were able to pay for a full soundtrack. Prunty retained the rights to the soundtrack, and since has been able to offer it on Bandcamp. Prunty wanted to create an interactive soundtrack that would change when the player entered and exited battle; for this, he composed the calmer \"Explore\" (non-battle) version of each song, then build atop that to create the more-engaging \"Battle\" version. Within the game, both versions of the song play at the same time, with the game cross-fading between the versions based on action in the game.One of the highest tiers of the Kickstarter campaign allowed a contributor to help design a race for inclusion in the game. One supporter contributed at this level and helped design a secret race, the Crystal.\n\n\n=== FTL: Advanced Edition ===\nIn November 2013, Subset announced that FTL: Advanced Edition was under development, and would add several new events, ships, equipment and other features to the existing game. This version was released on April 3, 2014 as a free update for FTL owners, and as a separate release for iPad devices, with the potential for other mobile systems in the future. Chris Avellone was announced as 'special guest writer' on the project.A new playable race, the Lanius — metallic lifeforms that reduce oxygen levels in any room they are in — was introduced. Additional components added to the game included a clone bay, a counterpart to the medical bay that creates clones of deceased crew with a small penalty against their skills, hacking drones that target specific systems on an enemy ship, a mind control system able to take control of an enemy crew member, a pulsar environmental hazard which periodically disables a ship's systems, and battery systems to give the player a short burst of power at their discretion. Other new features included a new ship and alien race, a third layout for eight of the now ten ships, new weapons, and additional beacon encounters, as well as a new sector.  An additional Hard difficulty mode was also introduced. All of the expansion's content can be disabled within the game if preferred.The team looked at bringing this version to the PlayStation Vita, which also would have supported touch controls, but ultimately believed that the screen size of the system was too limiting for the game.Subset Games has stated that they would not likely create a direct sequel to FTL, though future games they are planning may include similar concepts that were introduced in FTL. It is unlikely that they will use a Kickstarter method to raise funds, as they have raised enough money through sales of FTL to continue to fund their future projects.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFTL received positive reviews, with praise for the game's captivating nature and means of tapping into the imagination of the players who have envisioned themselves as captains of starships. The game's approach and setting has been compared to science fiction works; Ben Kuchera of Penny Arcade Report called FTL \"Firefly by way of the Rogue-like genre\", while others have compared it to Star Trek and Star Wars.PC Gamer awarded FTL its Short-form Game of the Year 2012 award. The game won both \"Excellence in Design\" and the \"Audience Award\", and was a finalist for the \"Seumas McNally Grand Prize\" awards for the 15th Annual Independent Games Festival. It was also named the \"Best Debut\" title at the 2013 Game Developers Choice Awards. At the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards FTL received the nomination for Game, Strategy (Justin Ma, Matthew Davis) and Game Engineering (Matthew Davis).  Forbes listed both Ma and Davis in its 2013 \"30 Under 30\" leaders in the field of games for the success of FTL.While reception of the game has generally been positive, some reviewers have criticized the game's difficulty level. Sparky Clarkson of GameCritics wrote, \"FTL is an absurdly, cruelly difficult game.\" The staff of Edge magazine, while generally complimentary towards the game, said, \"FTL can occasionally feel punishing\".The iPad version of FTL: Advanced Edition was praised for the intuitive touch controls, fine-tuned to work on the device. This version has received universal acclaim with a Metacritic score of 88/100 based on 17 reviews.FTL, along with indie titles Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac, are considered to be key games that launched the concept of \"roguelike-like\" games that borrow a subset of major features of classical roguelike games but not all; most often, as with FTL, these games use procedural generation along with permadeath atop other gameplay mechanics to create a highly-replayable experience.The game's soundtrack was nominated for IGN's Best Overall Music and Best PC Sound of 2012. It was recognized as being among Kotaku's Best Video Game Music of 2012, one of the Top Ten Video Game Soundtracks of 2012 on The Game Scouts, and one of Complex magazine's 25 Best Video Game Soundtracks on Bandcamp.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
      "FTL: Faster Than Light is a top down, real time strategy game created by indie developers Subset Games. In the game, the player controls the crew of a single spacecraft, holding critical information to be delivered to an allied fleet several sectors away, while being pursued by a large rebel fleet. The player must guide the spacecraft over a number of sectors, each with planetary systems and events procedurally generated in a roguelike fashion, while facing against rebel and other hostile forces, recruiting new crew, and outfitting and upgrading their ship. Combat takes place in pausable real time, and if the ship is destroyed or the crew lost, the game ends in permadeath, requiring the player to restart.The concept for FTL was based on tabletop board games and other non-strategic space combat video games that required the player to manage an array of ship's functions. The initial development by the two-man Subset Games was self-funded, and guided towards developing entries for various indie game competitions. With positive responses from players and judges at these events, Subset opted to engage in a crowd-sourced Kickstarter campaign to finish the title, and succeeded in obtaining twenty times more than they had sought; the extra funds were used towards more professional art, music and in-game writing. The game, considered one of the major successes of the Kickstarter fundraisers for video games, was released in September 2012, to many positive reviews.The player controls a faster-than-light (FTL) travel capable spacecraft belonging to the Federation, which is on the verge of collapse after losing a war with human-supremacist rebel forces. The player's crew intercepts a data packet from the rebel fleet containing information that could throw the rebels into disarray and ensure a Federation victory. The goal is to reach Federation headquarters, waiting several space sectors away, while avoiding destruction or capture by the pursuing rebels.At game start, the player chooses a spacecraft with several specific systems rooms (piloting, engines, weapons, life support, etc.), and a crew. The game randomly generates multiple space sectors à la roguelike games, with twenty-some interesting way-points per sector. The player must \"jump\" the ship between way-points, normally unaware what awaits at each point, making headway to an \"exit\" point leading to the next sector until the Federation is reached. Players can revisit way-points, but each warp jump consumes fuel and causes the rebel fleet to occupy more of the space in each sector. Encounters are more dangerous deeper within the rebel sphere of influence.Way-points may include stores that offer ship systems, fuel, ammunition, crew recruits, and hull repairs for a certain amount of scrap (in-game currency). Other way-points may appear as distress calls from stranded ships or traps set by rebels and other hostile groups. Certain destinations are hazardous to the ship or ship functions: asteroid belts continually pelt ships, nebulae disable sensors, and flares from red giant stars cause fires. Hostile ships often attack the player, and must either be destroyed or fought until they offer surrender. During attacks the game becomes a real-time space combat simulator in which the player can pause the game for situation evaluation and command input.In combat, the player can manage the ship's systems by distributing power, order crew to specific stations or rooms to repair damage, and fire weapons at the enemy ship. Successful weapon strikes by either side can damage systems, disabling their functions until repaired by crew; cause hull breaches that vent air into space until patched by crew; ignite fires that spread and damage both systems and the hull until they are extinguished by crew or starved of oxygen; and inflict direct hull damage, which reduces the ship's hull points (the player can restore hull points via stores, friendly bases, random events, and hull repair drones). A ship is destroyed once its hull points are reduced to zero, or defeated once its crew is eliminated. A player victory earns resources for bartering, upgrading, or combat; an enemy victory results in game failure, deleting the save file and forcing the player to start over creating a high level of difficulty. Alternatively, the player may evade combat by jumping to another way-point after the ship's engines have charged.The game begins with a single accessible ship, the Kestrel-class cruiser. Eight further ships are unlocked by completing objectives. Each ship has a second layout—a different color scheme, equipment, and crew—that can be unlocked by completing base-layout objectives. Each ship design and layout begin focused on different game play aspects; the ship roster has designs for stealth, boarding, drone systems, and other variations. The game also has separate achievements with no gameplay impact. The game can be modified by the user to alter the various ship configurations.[1]FTL is the product of the two-man team of Subset Games, Matthew Davis and Justin Ma. Both were employees of 2K Games's Shanghai studio, and became friends during their tenure there, playing various board games in their free time.[2] Ma, who considered himself a jack-of-all-trades, had become dissatisfied with working in a larger studio, and after traveling to the 2011 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco and seeing the Independent Games Festival, he realized he wanted to become an independent developer.[2] Davis had left 2K Games early in 2011, and after biking through China, returned and joined Ma, who had also recently quit, and began working on the core FTL game.[3] They agreed they would spend a year towards development and if their efforts did not pan out, they would go on to other things.[2]The idea for the game was inspired by tabletop board games, such as Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game,[4] and non-strategic video games, such as Star Wars: X-Wing, where the player would have to route power to available systems to best manage the situation.[3] Unlike most space combat simulation games, \"the initial concept was as simple as wanting to put the player in the commander's chair instead of the pilot's\", according to Davis,[5] and to make \"the player feel like they were Captain Picard yelling at engineers to get the shields back online\", as stated by Ma.[2] The intent of the game was to make it feel like a \"suicide mission\", and had adjusted the various elements of the game to anticipate a 10% success rate.[4] They looked to Super Meat Boy as an example of a game designed \"to be hard, but not frustrating\", according to Ma, noting that there were almost no barriers to the player restarting after a failed attempt; in considering that a loss in FTL means the player must restart the game, they felt that there had to be no barriers at all for the player to start a new game.[4] However, they also considered that each loss was a learning experience for the player, gaining knowledge of what battles to engage in and when to avoid or abandon unwinnable fights.[4] The permanence of a gameplay mistake was a critical element they wanted to include, and gameplay features such as permadeath emphasized this approach.[4]Their preliminary versions used primitive art assets to allow them to focus on the game. This helped them to realize that they were trying to help the player become invested in the characters they controlled, allowing their imagination to fill in what their graphics at the time could not.[2] Only as they neared the August 2011 Game Developers Conference in China after about six months of work, where they planned to submit FTL as part of the Independent Games Festival there, did they start focusing on the game's art.[3][5] The game was named as a finalist at the IGF China competition, leading to initial media exposure for the game.[6] PC Gamer magazine offered an early preview of the game that created more media interest in time for the Independent Games Festival at the March 2012 Games Developer Conference.[7] The OnLive cloud-based gaming service included FTL and other Independent Games Festival finalists for several weeks around the conference.[8][9] At the Festival, FTL was nominated for, though did not win, the Grand Prize and the Excellent in Design award; these accolades further helped to spark interest in the game.[6] Davis considered that the game's involvement in these competitions were important to keep the game's development on a forward schedule, as judges and members of the press would be expecting playable prototypes of the completed title.[10] Davis believed that the publicity of being a part of these competitions, even if not as a nominated title, helped to garner interest in FTL by the larger public.[10]Subset Games had initially planned to work on the title for about a three-month period after saving enough of their own money to cover expenses for about a year.[4] The additional attention to the game forced them to extend development - what would be a two-year process - and thus they turned to Kickstarter in order to fund the final polish of the game as well as costs associated to its release, seeking a total funding goal of $10,000.[11] Their Kickstarter approach was considered well-timed, riding on the coattails of the highly successful Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter in March 2012,[12] as well as gaining the attention of top developers like Ken Levine and Markus Persson;[5] with interest spurred in crowd-funded games, Subset games was able to raise over $200,000 through the effort.[11] FTL represents one of the first games to come out from this surge in crowd-funded games, and demonstrates that such funding mechanisms can support video game development.[12]With the larger funding, Subset has considered the benefit of adding more features at the cost of extending the game's release schedule. They opted to make some small improvements on the game, with only a one-month release delay from their planned schedule, and stated they would use the remaining Kickstarter funds for future project development.[4] The additional funds allowed them to pay for licensing fees of middleware libraries and applications to improve the game's performance.[4] Additionally, they were able to outsource other game assets; in particular additional writing and world design was provided by Tom Jubert (Penumbra, Driver: San Francisco),[4] while music was composed by Ben Prunty.[13] Prunty was introduced to Subset through another game developer, Anton Mikhailov, that was a common friend to both Prunty and Davis. Prunty was already ready to provide Subset with some music tracks prior to the Kickstarter, but with its success, they were able to pay for a full soundtrack. Prunty retained the rights to the soundtrack, and since has been able to offer it on Bandcamp.[13] Prunty wanted to create an interactive soundtrack that would change when the player entered and exit battle; for this, he composed the calmer \"Explore\" (non-battle) version of each song, then build atop that to create the more-engaging \"Battle\" version. Within the game, both versions of the song play at the same time, with the game cross-fading between the versions based on action in the game.[13] A secret race in the game, the Crystal, is the result of one person contributing at a high enough level for the tier reward that allowed the person to help design the race for inclusion in the game.[4]Subset Games has stated that they would not likely create a direct sequel to FTL, though future games they are planning may include similar concepts that were introduced in FTL.[4] It is unlikely that they will use a Kickstarter method to raise funds, as they have raised enough money through sales of FTL to continue to fund their future projects.[4]FTL received positive reviews, with praise for the game's captivating nature and means of tapping into the imagination of players who have envisioned themselves as captains of starships. The game's approach and setting has been compared to science fiction works; Ben Kuchera of Penny Arcade Report calls FTL \"Firefly by way of the Rogue-like genre\",[20] while others have compared it to Star Trek, Star Wars, and Battlestar Galactica.[16]PC Gamer awarded FTL its Short-form Game of the Year 2012 award.[21] The game won both \"Excellence in Design\" and the \"Audience Award\",[22] and was a finalist for the \"Seumas McNally Grand Prize\" awards for the 15th Annual Independent Games Festival.[23] It was also named the \"Best Debut\" title at the 2013 Game Developers Choice Awards.[24]While reception of the game has generally been positive, some reviewers have criticized the game's difficulty level. Sparky Clarkson of GameCritics wrote, \"FTL is an absurdly, cruelly difficult game.\"[25] The staff of Edge magazine, while generally complimentary towards the game, said, \"FTL can occasionally feel punishing\".[26]The game's soundtrack was nominated for IGN's Best Overall Music and Best PC Sound of 2012.[27][28] Additionally, it was recognized as being among Kotaku's Best Video Game Music of 2012,[29] one of the Top Ten Video Game Soundtracks of 2012 on The Game Scouts,[30] one of Complex magazine's 25 Best Video Game Soundtracks on Bandcamp,[31] and one of NeoGAF's Official Game Soundtracks of the Year 2012.[32]Awards | Changelog | Cheats | Codes | Codex  Compatibility | Covers | Credits | DLC | Help  Patches | Ratings | Reviews | Manifest  Screenshots | Soundtrack | Videos  WalkthroughGameRankings84.85%[14]Metacritic84/100[15]Eurogamer8/10[16]GameSpot8/10[17]GameSpy[18]IGN8/10[19]",

      "FTL: Faster Than Light is a space flight simulator game incorporating elements of roguelike games, developed by Subset Games. In the game, the player controls a single space craft, attempting to deliver critical information to its allies across several sectors of space while avoiding rebel forces that seek the information for themselves and other hostile entities. As the player continues across the region of space, they gain equipment and currency to improve their ship's offenses, defenses, and sub-systems, expand the ship's capabilities, or additional crew members to boost the performance of the ship. Combat and repair is done in real-time, though the player can pause the game to assess the situation and issue orders; the game otherwise features permadeath scenarios, randomly generating new challenges each time a new game is started.FTL was announced on February 27, 2012 via Kickstarter and released in September 14, 2012 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.[1]FTL is a space flight simulator game, where the player controls a spacecraft whose crew has intercepted a data packet from a rebel fleet. The goal is to reach a Federation fleet, waiting several sectors of space away, without being destroyed or caught by the rebel fleet that is in pursuit. The game, though sometimes called a roguelike, only incorporates some elements of this genre, as described by its creators, \"mostly just as a representation for some of the main thematic elements of the genre\".[2]At the start of each game, the player chooses a spacecraft which houses a number of rooms devoted to specific systems, like piloting, engines, weapons, and life support, as well as a crew. The game then randomly generates a series of sectors ala roguelike games, each sector containing about twenty-some waypoints of interest. The player must direct the ship to warp between these points, normally unaware of what to expect at each point, making their way to a specific \"exit\" point to move onto the next sector until they reach the Federation.  Players can revisit waypoints, but each warp jump consumes fuel and causes the rebel fleet to occupy more of the space in each sector. Encounters become more dangerous the deeper they occur within the rebels' sphere of influence.Waypoints may include stores where the player can upgrade the ship's systems, purchase fuel and ammunition, and recruit new crewmembers using in-game currency. Other waypoints may appear as calls of distress, either from stranded ships needing help or traps set by the rebels or other hostile groups. Certain destinations may be hazardous to the ship or disable certain functions, such as asteroid belts that continually cause damage to the ship while the craft remains within it, or nebula that disables sensor systems. Often, the player will encounter an unfriendly ship that engages in combat. Here the game becomes a real-time space combat simulator, though the player can pause the game to evaluate the situation. During combat, the player must manage which ship's systems to activate considering the power draw on the ship, ordering the crew to specific stations or rooms to repair damage, and targeting and firing of weapons on the enemy. Damage to the ship can include failure of specific systems until a crewman repairs them, hull breaches that leak air to space, fires that can be either put out by the crew or by starving the fire of air, and general damage to the hull which can only be repaired at stores and other specific locations. The game ends if the hull fails and the ship is destroyed or all of the crew members die. The game uses permadeath in that although the player can save games between playing sessions, the save game is immediately overwritten upon relaunch, preventing the player from restarting a game from a previous saved game. The player is successful in combat either by destroying the enemy ship, eliminating the enemy crew or damaging enough to cause the ship to surrender; this provides resources that the player can use in bartering, upgrading, or combat. Alternatively, the player can wait for their ship's engine to charge to jump to another waypoint and escape battle.The game begins with a single unlocked hull, with eight further hulls unlockable by completing various objectives. Each hull has a second unlockable layout with a different colour scheme, beginning equipment, and starting crew, unlocked by completing objectives specific to the base hull. Each individual hull and layout tends to begin focused on different aspects of gameplay, with the roster including ships designed for stealth, boarding, drone systems, and other variations. The game also features a separate list of achievements with no impact on gameplay.FTL is the product of the two-man team of Subset Games, Matthew Davis and Justin Ma. Both were employees of 2K Games's Shanghai studio. Davis had left 2K Games early in 2011, and after biking through China, returned and joined Ma, who had also recently quit, and began working on the core FTL game.[3] The idea for the game was inspired by tabletop board games and non-stragetic video games, such as Star Wars: X-Wing, where the player would have to route power to available systems to best manage the situation.[3]Their preliminary versions used primitive art assets to allow them to focus on the game; only as they neared the August 2011 Game Developers Conference in China, where they planned to submit FTL as part of the Independent Games Festival there, did they start focusing on the game's art.[3] The game was named as a finalist at the IGF China competition, leading to initial media exposure for the game.[4] PC Gamer magazine offered an early preview of the game that created more media interest in time for the Independent Games Festival at the March 2012 Games Developer Conference.[5] The OnLive cloud-based gaming service included FTL and other Independent Games Festival finalists for several weeks around the conference.[6][7] At the Festival, FTL was nominated for, though did not win, the Grand Prize and the Excellent in Design award; these accolades further helped to spark interest in the game.[4]Although much of the game was initially self funded, Subset Games turned to Kickstarter in order to fund the final polish of the game as well as costs associated to its release, seeking a total funding goal of $10,000.[1] Their Kickstarter approach was considered well-timed, riding on the coattails of the highly-successful Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter in March 2012;[8] with interest spurred in crowd-funded games, Subset games was able to raise over $200,000 through the effort.[1] FTL represents one of the first games to come out from this surge in crowd-funded games, and demonstrates that such funding mechanisms can support video game development.[8]With the larger funders, Subset was able to outsource other game assets; in particular for music composed by Ben Prunty.[9] Prunty was introduced to Subset through another game developer, Anton Mikhailov, that was a common friend to both Prunty and Davis. Prunty was already ready to provide Subset with some music tracks prior to the Kickstarter, but with its success, they were able to pay for a full soundtrack. Prunty retained the rights to the soundtrack, and since has been able to offer it on Bandcamp.[9]  Prunty wanted to create an interactive soundtrack that would change when the player entered and exit battle; for this, he composed the calmer \"Explore\" (non-battle) version of each song, then build atop that to create the more-engaging \"Battle\" version. Within the game, both versions of the song play at the same time, with the game cross-fading between the versions based on action in the game.[9]FTL received positive reviews from journalists on its release, with praise for the game's captivating nature and means of tapping into the imagination of players who have envisioned themselves as captains of starships. The game's approach and setting has been compared to science fiction works; Ben Kuchera of Penny Arcade Report calls FTL \"Firefly by way of the Rogue-like genre\",[16] while others have compared it to Star Trek, Star Wars, and Battlestar Galactica.[12]250pxDeveloper(s)Subset GamesPlatform(s)Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, LinuxRelease date(s)September 14, 2012GenreSpace flight simulation roguelikeMode(s)Single-playerMediaDigital distributionGameRankings84.85%[10]Metacritic83/100[11]Eurogamer8/10[12]GameSpot8/10[13]GameSpy[14]IGN8/10[15]This article uses material from the Wikipedia article FTL: Faster Than Light, that was deleted or is being discussed for deletion, which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n\n\n Author(s): Longbyte1\n Search for \"FTL: Faster Than Light\" on GoogleView Wikipedia's deletion log of \"FTL: Faster Than Light\"Author(s): Longbyte1Search for \"FTL: Faster Than Light\" on GoogleView Wikipedia's deletion log of \"FTL: Faster Than Light\"",

      "This afternoon, while listening to a podcast chronicling year-end games of 2017, I heard one of the hosts mention Into the Breach, a 2018 project from Subset Games (a title that I’m familiar with). Hearing this brief mention reminded me that I still have Subset’s earlier project — FTL: Faster Than Light — sitting on my iPad, and that it has been several months since I’ve played it. I opened the game a few short hours later, and quickly lost myself in the galaxy of this fantastic strategy game. 2017 was a fantastic year for video game releases, but this game still stands out five years after its release.When I first saw FTL on Steam, I was unimpressed. I’ve always had a tenuous relationship with strategy games, and I normally prefer navigating one character in a game to navigating multiple. The game kept popping up on “best-of” lists for iPad games however, and I eventually took the plunge. From then on, despite a singular lack of skill, I have greatly enjoyed every moment spent in its randomly-generated, punishing, and always-intriguing universe.FTL is light on story, but what’s there is compelling enough. Players control a Federation starship on the run from the rebels that is tasked with delivering critical information. This on its own wouldn’t be enough to build a compelling universe, but Subset games populated its various worlds with different races, all of which are distinctly separate from the “normal” humans that players start out with. There is also a lightly sketched out backstory of how these different races interact with each other, building a believable concept that adds depth to the moment-to-moment action.That moment-to-moment action is the first truly compelling part of FTL. The game operates in real time, and players control the engine, shields, and weapons of various starships (there is only one at first, but more are unlockable). At first, it seems simple. Firing weapons is easy, and making sure that the shields are always powered up is similarly so. The combat has a distinct rhythm to it, and there are tangible rewards to upgrading weapons and adding crew members.As players progress further and further into the universe, the combat gets much more difficult. Firing weapons and maintaining shields is easy enough, but when other ships possess enough firepower to knock out player weapons (or, even worse, the oxygen), the game’s real-time mechanics quickly shift toward “unforgiving.” Personally, I always seem to hit a wall about two-thirds of the way through. I can chart my way through most of the universe well enough, but I’m not good at adapting once I’ve lost a few crew members or weapon systems.Defeat is a constant in FTL, and the game’s roguelike system means that it can be emotionally crushing. I’ve reached the endgame a few times, and the inevitable defeat there always sends me back to a starting point devoid of my precious upgrades and crew. However, the game’s procedural design and random events allow each play through to be different, and Subset games executes this element perfectly. Some procedurally-generated games feel cheap and lazy, but the random levels feel handcrafted every time. If the moment-to-moment action is the first compelling part of this game, the roguelike design and inherent randomness to each run is the second. The combat drew me in, but the infinite replay-ability kept me enthralled.Beyond what I’ve written here, it’s hard to explain just what makes FTL so great. The concept is original and fun, the gameplay mechanics are well-balanced, and the difficult challenges never feel unfair. Many other developers have checked all of these boxes before though, and few games have the lasting appeal that FTL does. Out of all the games I’ve ever played on my iPad, this one is easily the most compelling and the one with the most lasting value. By now, it’s an old friend that I enjoy spending time with.The success of FTL means that expectations for Into the Breach are sky-high, and this newest project looks compelling. As 2017 ends though, I’m happy to have an excuse to pick up FTL again. It’s a fantastic game, and one that hasn’t lost a step with age.Writer, among other things. Here, you’ll find my thoughts on a host of subjects, but primarily history and video games.A personal blog for my thoughts on music, video games, books, podcasts, history, and anything else I feel motivated to share.",

In my free time if I’m not playing one I’m usually thinking about game design. Other than games,\nmy wife and I love to travel and we’ve spent a number of years living and exploring Asia. We’re obsessed with good food from around the world and try to spend as much time in nature as possible.What are your future plans? Do you plan on continuing to produce games? Do you plan on working for another AAA studio, or to make Subset games a large development studio?It’s hard to think about on the long term when we’re entirely focused on development. Hopefully we’ll be able to continue making games for a long time. I think our strength lies in the dynamic between Matt and myself so we have no plans to grow into a larger studio.How did FTL’s success influence your design philosophy?I believe it’s made us question our ideas a lot more. Designing Into The Breach has been an exercise in trying to ignore self doubts and external concerns while simply trying to find mechanics we believe are fun.I know both you and Matthew worked for 2K China – Do you think working for a AAA company has given you an advantage on the indie scene – do you use any tricks or systems that a large studio uses that you think most indie studios do not?I think there are some key skills we learned from our brief stay in a large studio. Perhaps the most important was the attitude that’s required to actually ship a product. When it comes down to it, learning how to cut imperfect designs is more important than learning how to design perfectly. We spend the majority of development trimming and cutting features and I feel this comfortableness with letting go of ideas largely formed during our time at 2K.Do the two of you ever disagree on design – how do you resolve those issues?We generally are on the same page when it comes to big picture design directions. We’ll often disagree about specifics or details of design, but we’re both pretty flexible. If one person feels strongly the other is usually willing to compromise. We share a lot of the same goals for the end game experience so even if we disagree in the design phase we’ll often agree when we start prototyping the mechanics.Do you have any advice for young developers?Just keep making things. Tiny prototypes, big design documents, anything. Try to focus on making things that you would enjoy rather than trying to guess what others would enjoy. Also there’s also a lot of negative stigma towards working at a large AAA studio. It may not be for everyone but it shouldn’t be discounted as an option by anyone.How would you describe “Into the Breach”?It’s a tactics game that’s heavily inspired by what we enjoy about FTL and other games that rely on procedural generation.What separates this from other games in the tactics genre?Every gameplay element is very granular and clear – hit points are low, damage of a weapon is static, there’s no hit or miss chance, etc. Additionally every turn you can see the enemies intended actions before they act and strategize accordingly. This allows you to come up with perfect strategies to defeat the enemy and even use the enemy’s own attacks against themselves. The result is that Into The Breach can sometimes almost feel like a puzzle game.Both “Into the Breach” and FTL both seem to have a sense of impending doom – an enemy that would seem insurmountable to defeat. Is this an intentional story decision to create a  system forcing you to move quickly?We like creating experiences where every decision the player makes has consequences. We also simply prefer to play games that have a high degree of challenge and a high skill cap. This often leads us towards game design principles like permadeath and high difficulty. This fits very well with stories of struggle against an insurmountable threat.\n\nDoes “Into the Breach” and FTL share a world, or are they separate universes entirely?No comment.What inspired you to make a Kaiju game?\n\nWe both like mech games and the mech vs monster setting lined up with some of our primary goals for the game experience.Are you planning on a large free update like you did with FTL – Faster than Light?We’re simply focused on finishing the game at this point.Thank you so much for your time! We are excited to hear more and hopefully we’ll have more information soon about “Into the Breach”Into the Breach does not currently have a release date, but it has a steam page. EDIT 3-16-18: INTO THE BREACH HAS BEEN RELEASED!\nYou can check out more information about FTL and Breach on their website.\nIf you haven’t checked out FTL: Faster than Light – get it on steam.\nAnd make sure to follow Subset Games on Twitter!This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

    "title": "Don't Starve",
    "text": [
      "Don't Starve is an open world survival video game developed by the Canadian indie company Klei Entertainment. The game was initially released via Valve Corporation's Steam software for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on April 23, 2013. A PlayStation 4 port, renamed Don't Starve: Giant Edition, became available the following year (with PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 versions released on September 2014 and June 2015 respectively, and an Xbox One version released in August 2015). Don't Starve for iOS, renamed Don't Starve: Pocket Edition was released on July 9, 2015. Android version was released on October 20, 2016. Downloadable content titled Reign of Giants was released on April 30, 2014, and a multiplayer expansion called Don't Starve Together became free for existing users on June 3, 2015. A Nintendo Switch port came out on April 12, 2018.[1]\nThe game follows a scientist named Wilson who finds himself in a dark, dreary world and must survive as long as possible. To this end, the player must keep Wilson healthy, fed, and mentally stable as he avoids a variety of surreal and supernatural enemies that will try to kill and devour him. The game's Adventure mode adds depth to the sparse plot and pits Wilson against the game's antagonist, Maxwell.\nDon't Starve was Klei's first foray into the survival genre. Conceived during the height of a game industry trend of dropping players into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival, the game was influenced by Minecraft, which spearheaded this trend, as well as by filmmaker Tim Burton. The game received positive reviews from critics, commended for its original art style, music, and variety of ways for the player to die, although its high level of difficulty and implementation of permanent death were less warmly received.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDon't Starve is an action-adventure game with a randomly generated open world and elements of survival and roguelike gameplay. Combat is handled by  pointing and clicking with the mouse, while other activities are controlled by the keyboard, or using the inbuilt gamepad support to play using a controller, giving it a console-like gameplay feel. The goal is to survive as long as possible, and a count of the number of days the player has survived is shown onscreen. The game keeps few records of player progress besides the total number of experience points and the playable characters unlocked. Wilson is the default playable character, unlocked upon purchase of the game, but the next character, Willow, can be unlocked with 160 experience points. Woodie, the last character unlockable with experience, requires the game's limit of 1,600. The player earns 20 experience points each in-game day and receives them after dying. As is common among roguelikes, death is permanent, barring the use of several rare or expensive items like the Meat Effigy, TouchStone, and Life-Giving Amulet.The game relies on a day/night cycle that causes meaningful fluctuations in gameplay style. During the day, the player spends most of their time exploring the world: gathering food, firewood, and other resources, discovering crafting recipes to combine available items, and avoiding enemies. With nightfall comes dangerous monsters and an invisible menace, Charlie, who attacks the player when the screen is dark. A player must have a light source or night vision to prevent Charlie from attacking. Crafting from recipes allows the player to build shelter, weapons, and tools like axes. Players can forage and farm plants as well as hunt animals for sustenance, with several characters having dietary perks or restrictions. Food can spoil, however, so the player cannot keep it for too long. Eating spoiled food results in a loss of health, sanity, and an increase in hunger. Each in-game day takes 8 minutes of real time.\n\nDeath can occur in a variety of ways. The player has three gauges displayed on the game's head-up display, which respectively track hunger, health, and sanity. Hunger worsens by default, being replenished with food. Sanity decreases during the dusk and night or as a result of specific unpleasant actions, such as robbing graves or fighting monsters; it can be replenished through mentally stimulating activities, such as sleeping, picking flowers, and wearing fashionable clothing. When hunger gets too low, it begins to chip away at health, which will eventually result in the player's death. A large variety of creatures can attack the player, including giant one-eyed birds, tree monsters, tentacles whose owners are not shown, and even small, weak frogs that will nonetheless try to accost the player and steal from them. Additionally, at low enough sanity, figments of the character's imagination become corporeal and able to attack the player. Some creatures, such as pig-like creatures often found in tribes, begin as neutral to the player (Excluding the Reign of Giants character Webber), but the player's actions may lead them to be allies or hostile foes.\nThe bulk of the game is played in Sandbox Mode, but there is a second mode, Adventure, which the player can access by finding a landmark called Maxwell's Door. Adventure serves as the game's campaign, consisting of five levels that pit the player against Maxwell, the antagonist of Don't Starve. The player loses all items and recipes upon entering, and can only pick four to keep upon completion of each chapter. Death or the end of the five sections returns the player intact to Sandbox Mode.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== Characters ===\nWilson, a gentleman scientist, is the protagonist of Don't Starve. While Wilson has no special abilities beyond growth of \"a magnificent beard\", which slows the speed of freezing in winter and accelerates overheating in summer, other playable characters do; a few examples follow. Willow, a firestarter, is immune to fire damage and will start spreadable fires on the ground when she has low sanity. A girl named Wendy receives visits from her deceased twin sister Abigail when summoned. The strongman, Wolfgang, has high health and significant offensive capabilities that grow better the more his hunger meter is full, but he starves faster and loses more sanity when near danger. WX-78 is an android that nonetheless needs to eat, sleep, and stay mentally stimulated, but does not become ill from spoiled food, can increase its maximum health, hunger, and sanity with gears (reset to the original maximum after dying and respawning; the corpse leaves behind a portion of the used ones), and takes damage from rain. WX-78 also attracts lightning, being made of conductible material, that makes it surrounded by a glow that gradually dies down as time passes, that refills health, and that lowers sanity.The game's antagonist is Maxwell. Maxwell is described as a puppet master who is dapper and frail in stature. He is part-demon and transforms incrementally as his anger at the player increases over the five chapters of Adventure. He is the final unlockable character, obtained after completion of the story rather than with experience points. The character version of Maxwell starts with a Dark Sword, Night Armor, Purple Gem, 4 Nightmare Fuel and the Codex Umbra, a book that when activated uses 2 nightmare fuel, depletes 15 health, lowers maximum sanity by 55, and spawns a shadow clone of himself that aids him in battle, mining and wood chopping. Shadow Puppets have 75 health and deal 40 damage with each attack. When they die, they disappear and return Maxwell's lost maximum of sanity. A maximum of 3 puppets can be spawned at once, and each will disappear 2.5 days after it is spawned if it doesn't die earlier.\n\n\n=== Story ===\nThe game opens with Maxwell snidely informing the player of their gaunt appearance and includes little further story. The game's setup is told further through its trailer: on a dark and stormy night, Wilson appears to be getting nowhere in a chemistry experiment until he is startled by his radio speaking to him. It reveals that it has noticed his trouble and has secret knowledge of him. When he eagerly agrees, a flurry of equations and diagrams encircle him and fill his head. Using white rats, a typewriter, and his blood among other tools and materials, Wilson creates a giant machine. The radio commends his work and tells him to pull the machine's switch. He hesitates, but at the radio's insistence, he does so. The machine rattles violently, and a pair of ghostly arms whisk him into a different world while an apparition of Maxwell cackles.During the Adventure mode, at the start of each chapter, Maxwell appears and comments. At first, he seems impressed at the player's hardiness; he then becomes irritated and urges the player to turn back. He offers the player a truce but, upon its decline, becomes enraged.At the end of Adventure mode, the player reaches an island called Maxwell's Island with a hall belonging to Maxwell on it. The player finds Maxwell trapped in a throne encircled by short stone pillars. The player is at first unable to free him but finds a keyhole and a key nearby. The player sets Maxwell free, but he turns into a skeleton and disintegrates as he stands up. The ghostly arms from the trailer then grab the player and ensnare him in the throne. An epilogue implies that the player will take on a villainous role similar to Maxwell's using newfound powers given by the throne but will nonetheless be trapped forever.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Conception and design ===\nDon't Starve was developed and published by indie studio Klei Entertainment. The game began development as part of a 48-hour game jam in 2010. The team liked the idea but shelved it until two years later, when they had the time to flesh it out. Full development commenced in 2012, while Klei was nearing the end of the development process of Mark of the Ninja. This was during the heat of an industry trend of creating games in which players are dropped into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival. The torch of this movement was held by the 2011 sandbox game Minecraft. Member Kevin Forbes stated in an interview that Minecraft was one of the team's biggest influences, particularly its exploration elements. However, as the game was conceived as a \"weird experiment\", the team's main goal was to innovate in terms of gameplay and aesthetics, specifically by adding a layer of emphasis on characterization and themes. Another influence was the 2005 Nintendo DS title Lost in Blue, which contains similar supernatural elements and a day/night cycle.The game's dark and supernatural yet cartoonish art style was influenced by the work of filmmaker Tim Burton, to which it has been frequently compared, and by writers Edward Gorey and H.P. Lovecraft. Forbes noted the team's ambition of creating something \"dark and creepy.\" After conception of the basic game setup, Forbes penned a backstory influenced by steampunk and horror, and lead creative director Jeff Agala added comic strip-like art elements. To further the game's atmosphere of loneliness and directionlessness, Klei decided firmly against multiplayer gameplay. However, in December 2014, after numerous requests, Klei finally released the multiplayer version of the game titled \"Don't Starve Together\" on Steam Early Access after an initial closed beta release. \nDevelopment was marked by a few changes to the game's formula that would be reverted. Most notably, at one point during development, Klei wanted to add quests to the existing open gameplay. Klei shelved this idea when they realized that \"having external goals is extremely counter to what is fun about the game.\" Nevertheless, Klei co-founder Jamie Cheng has emphasized that Klei values the freedom to try different approaches that being tied to a major publisher would not afford them.Cheng related in an interview that Don't Starve's development taught Klei a considerable amount about the nature of the emergent gameplay that was endemic to its open and random world; Klei tries to experiment with a new genre with each project and prefers not to create sequels to any of its games. These lessons would later be used to balance the mechanics of Klei's upcoming project Invisible, Inc.\n\n\n=== Releases and updates ===\nKlei employees argued at length about whether to release Don't Starve as a free-to-play game. Forbes stated that he \"wouldn't rule it out as a business model\" but that the team was not ready to make such a decision. It was, however, free in the early days of beta testing.Don't Starve was released in beta form in 2012, a move that Klei decided on to find out \"what aspects of the game players are really responding to, and [nip] usability issues in the bud.\" Klei's Cory Rollins has stated that he finds that most developers' beta periods simply serve as an early release of the game and result in few glitches being fixed, and wanted to make more use of the strategy. Added benefits the team discovered during beta testing were that it forced them to make important decisions about the game's upcoming release well in advance, and that it solidified a player base. In addition, Klei added the ability for food to spoil during this time, inspired by a forum thread about such possibilities. Cheng found Don't Starve to have \"ended up a way better game because of the community.\" It spent a few months in beta testing, and Klei continued to give updates for months after its release.In June 2013, shortly after the game's main release, a PlayStation 4 version was announced; it would not be released until January of the following year. In a January 2014 interview, Rollins mentioned internal discussions of creating a PlayStation Vita version of Don't Starve, citing massive community interest in playing it on the PlayStation 4 remotely. An iOS edition was released in July 2014. The company is also considering other mobile phone adaptations, as well as a potential sequel, but is not prioritizing them.\n\n\n==== Don't Starve: Reign of Giants ====\nDon't Starve: Reign of Giants, the game's first paid downloadable content expansion, was announced on January 18, 2014. Three cryptic teasers were released, each named after a season of the year.

The game sold one million copies by the end of 2013. Don't Starve was a finalist for the grand prize and \"Excellence in Design\" subcategory at the 2014 Independent Games Festival awards ceremony. It also received honorable mentions for \"Excellence in Visual Art\" and \"Excellence in Audio.\"The game's art style was critically acclaimed. Summarizing that the \"distinct art style and atmosphere set a cool vibe,\" GameSpot's Nathan Meunier commended the atmosphere and visual design. Marty Sliva of IGN claimed an \"immense appreciation for the paper-cutout graphical style and whimsical presentation\", going on to praise the threatening qualities bestowed upon mundane objects by the \"gothic-inspired look.\" Game Informer writer Jeff Marchiafava stated that \"the cartoony art style makes exploring your massive, randomized world a joy.\" Writing for the newspaper Toronto Sun, Steve Tilley called the art \"whimsical and wonderful\" and the presentation in general \"captivating.\" Reviewing the PlayStation 4 version specifically, Jordan Devore of Destructoid said that it looked and played very well on the console, though he did note some pixelation effects when the screen zooms in on the inventory. He also found that the gamepad controls, while less efficient than a keyboard, were similarly enjoyable.The music was generally well received. Sliva compared it to carnival music and called it \"immediately catchy\" though lacking in variation. Giancarlo Saldana of GamesRadar called it \"eerie [yet] calming\" and praised its role in complementing the simultaneously lonesome and dangerous world.Critics universally acknowledged but gave mixed opinions on the game's high level of difficulty. This sentiment was captured by Sliva's comment that \"Don't Starve will never, ever hold your hand, and I both love it and hate it for that.\" For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that \"survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge,\" but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that \"learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory makes you feel like you’re winning with a capital FU.\" Reviewers also felt that players' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival.The lack of a permanent saving mechanic and permanence of death were criticized. Marchiafava, while normally a fan of permadeath in games, found it problematic in Don't Starve because, unlike other games such as The Binding of Isaac and Spelunky, Don't Starve is much longer and so death felt like more of a loss. Meunier noted that the novelty and thrills of each new run wear off somewhat \"when you're stuck tackling the same menial tasks over and over again to regain lost ground.\" Sliva expressed disappointment at being given \"nearly no recognition from Don't Starve itself\" upon being killed by a frog, and reported being bored for roughly 30 minutes at the overly familiar starts of later playthroughs. Brown thought similarly, also calling the early game in particular \"a bit dull.\" Saldana, however, reasoned that \"you at least gain some knowledge of how things work\" and would make incremental, enjoyable progress.The variety of unusual, numerous, and frequently placed ways for the player to die were singled out for praise. Focusing on the harm caused by subzero temperatures during winter, Meunier found that \"these interesting wrinkles add depth and additional difficulty to the already challenging survival mechanics at play.\" Jessica Conditt of Joystiq praised the high number of ways to die and the game's efficient, easy-to-understand display of the player's health, hunger, and mental stability. Saldana noted that the unfamiliarity of some monster designs would help to keep the player wary.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCrashlands\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

      "Don't Starve is a Roguelike dark fantasy survival game created by Klei Entertainment and released in April, 2013. It is currently available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux through Steam or stand-alone application. Don't Starve is also available on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PlayStation Vita,[1] and Wii U.[2]Don't Starve challenges the player to survive in a wilderness environment for as long as possible. In Sandbox Mode, the only way the game ends is with the player's death or by restarting the game in a new random world through the use of the Wooden Thing. When the player dies they are awarded Experience for the number of days they survived. Each death provides experience, which is added to a cumulative total and used to unlock additional playable characters. Although death is permanent and the player's world will be lost when the game ends, various methods of resurrection can be found to stave-off the inevitable.The canonical game plot centers around Wilson, a gentleman scientist tricked by the mysterious Maxwell into building a machine which transports him to a strange world filled with monsters and other challenges.[3] The player must help Wilson navigate the various worlds of Adventure Mode, which offer more difficulty as the game progresses. Wilson will begin to understand why Maxwell brought him into this world and the terrible secret of his power. Along the way, the player will find an extra character who can only be unlocked during Adventure Mode, and he will eventually confront Maxwell himself.Main article: Don't_Starve/Version_HistoryThe game's developer, Klei Entertainment, has committed to a series of game updates for at least 6 months after the game's initial release. A large portion of these updates have focused on adding a new environment (Caves) to the game, along with other new content and bug fixes.[4]Main article: DLCDon't Starve: Reign of Giants was the first downloadable content pack created for Don't Starve.Don't Starve: Shipwrecked is the second downloadable content pack created for Don't Starve.Don't Starve Together is the multiplayer expansion of Don't Starve, distributed independently from Don't Starve game in Steam.Don't Starve: Giants Edition is the PlayStation Vita port of Don't Starve, containing the Reign of Giants DLC.Don't Starve Pocket Edition is the iOS 8+/Android 5.1+ game, containing the Reign of Giants DLC.Don't Starve Pocket Edition: Shipwrecked is sold as a separate app for iOS 8+, and it only includes the Shipwrecked DLC.Don't Starve: Nintendo Switch Edition is the special version of Don't Starve for Nintendo Switch, containing both the Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked DLCs.Don't Starve has received moderately positive reviews from critics. GameRankings has given it a combined score of 78.69%, while Metacritic gives it 79/100. Armchair Empire rated the game 8.5/10 saying, \"Players looking for a game that will consume them for the next while should consider Don't Starve. The whole process of gathering supplies, and making a go of surviving in the wild while fending off starvation, madness, and predators is quite entertaining.\"[5] Hardcore Gamer Magazine however was more negative, giving the game only a 2.5/5 rating and saying, \"Unless there’s a major update in the near future, you’d be better off waiting until it inevitably becomes part of an indie bundle so that you can briefly jump in and enjoy its first few hours. Until then, your money and time should be spent elsewhere.\"[6]Don't Starve was a finalist for the grand prize and \"Excellence in Design\" subcategory at the 2014 Independent Games Festival awards ceremony; it also received honorable mentions for \"Excellence in Visual Art\" and \"Excellence in Audio.\" [7]",
      "Follow UsKlei Entertainment has a history of making new and innovative games. From its side-scrolling beat-em-up, Shank, to its ninja stealth game, Mark of the Ninja, Klei Entertainment has succeeded in creating unique games that make the most of the conventions of their genre. In 2013, Klei Entertainment outdid itself when it created Don't Starve, a survival adventure game.In Don't Starve, the player must survive in a procedurally generated world, by gathering resources needed to craft weapons and tools. Without very many instructions, the player must learn how to best handle the elements while managing the character's sanity and hunger. With subsequent DLC, Don't Starve added even more challenges, with an additional season, new mechanics, and creatures.Every game in Don't Starve is different from others thanks to the vast amount of challenges presented to the player in the game. Starvation, loss of sanity, darkness, freezing, and overheating are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things the player must prepare for in order to survive. Thanks to the number of challenges and lack of information, death is so commonplace in Don't Starve that even the smallest accomplishments provide the sweetest taste of victory. Of course, none of that matters if the player dies, as death is permanent and the player is forced to start the game over in a new challenging world.(deployads = window.deployads || []).push({});The world outside is overrun with zombies; inside your makeshift shelter, you are running out of supplies. What do you do? The only thing you can do: survive. That's the name of the game in 7 Ways to Die, the horror survival game that sees the player attempting to survive a zombie apocalypse for as long as possible. Every night the zombies come for you, with the horde being bigger and more aggressive on the 7th day. If the player manages to survive the nights and week, then the game continues with another week of survival.To survive, the player must scavenge the world to find food, water, and materials to craft into tools. In the game, almost everything is destructible and can provide crafting materials. Everything degrades over time as well, forcing the player to seek out new places to scavenge material from, as well as constantly repair and improve their shelter.7 Ways to Die has a different approach its combat from Don't Starve, making it a strong focus of the gameplay. Fans of Don’t Starve's survival will definitely enjoy 7 Ways to Die for its different take on the survival crafting genre.When Eric Leblanc's airplane crashes on a mysterious island and his son is dragged away by a group of cannibals, he's left to fend for himself. As Eric, the player must uncover the mystery of the island, while surviving the threat of the cannibals that took his son away Though The Forest has a story that the player can play through, should they choose to do so, its lack of missions and quests give the player the power to choose how they survive. The Forest provides the same general survival options as Don't Starve. The Forest features a day/night cycle. During the day, the player can build a shelter, set traps, hunt and collect supplies.Like in Don't Starve, the day/night cycle plays a huge part in the player's interactions with the game's enemy. While the cannibals that threaten Eric are a threat throughout the day, they become more aggressive at night. Their fear of fire, however, ensures that a campfire or torch plays a more significant role than providing the player with light and heat.Combining the challenge of survival with horror films like The Descent and Cannibal Holocaust, The Forest takes Don't Starve into the realm of the dark and creepy.Terraria is a 2D action-adventure sandbox game with a focus on exploring instead of survival. To successfully explore the world and overcome the different creatures that the world has to offer, the player must collect resources from the game's environment. Different resources can be collected from different areas of the map, each offering their own unique challenge to the player.The resources found throughout the world can be used to craft new tools and weapons, from their respective workstations. Like in Don't Starve, some of the tools and items created at one workstation is necessary to create items from a different workstation. The crafting in Terraria is essential to finding success because as the player explores the world, the new creatures and enemies are encountered. By crafting certain items, the player's health and magic can be increased, improving the player's chance to survive against the new enemies faced.Unlike Don't Starve, Terraria's building system isn't used to directly increase the player's ability to survive. Through building and complete certain quests, the player is able to attract NPC which provide goods and services that can be purchased by the player. Still, Terraria's community building system that's tied along to its building gives the player incentive to build bigger and better.(deployads = window.deployads || []).push({});Crashlands places the player in control of Flux Dabes, a galactic trucker who becomes stranded on planet Woanope after being attacked by Hewgoodoko. Stuck on this mysterious planet, Flux and her robot companion Juicebox must travel Woanope to find the tools and materials necessary to send a message to the Bureau of Shipping.Crashlands has a similar crafting system to Don't Starve, where everything collected in the world can be used to create structures, equipment, and tools necessary for exploring Woanope. Crashlands simplifies the process for crafting with its infinite and self-sorting inventory. This allows the player to focus on the exploration and crafting. Mainly a crafting game, Crashlands has some serious RPG elements which set it apart from other crafting games. By crafting items, the player can create stronger and more powerful armor and weapons to aid Flux in her journey.Don't Starve's main draw is its relentless survival mode; there is a story mode, but its hidden somewhere on the map and features the same survival challenge as the standard sandbox mode. Crashlands, on the other hand, is story driven, with the story's quests and characters being the main way to learn new crafting recipes, acquire rare materials and equipment, and access other biomes of the world. Despite this different focus on story and adventure, if you enjoyed Don't Starve's crafting, humor and limitless exploration, then Crashlands is sure to impress.People who enjoyed Don't Starve's gameplay, but was turned off by its art style, which, honestly, we're not sure how anyone could be, will be glad to know that The Long Dark is essentially a first-person Don't Starve. The Long Dark is a survival game with two game modes, sandbox and story mode. Like Don't Starve, the main goal of sandbox mode is to survive as long as possible.To achieve this, the player must scavenge for resources like food, water, and tools. Like in Don't Starve, tools that the player uses degrades over time, resulting in a constant need to continually search for new, more reliable tools to use. One of the most important things needed to be scavenged is wood and fuel to create fire which is necessary for warmth and cooking the assortment of wildlife that can be hunted for food while also posing a threat to the player. Food, however, can also pose the threat of going bad and causing food poisoning. Like in Don't Starve and real survival, the same thing necessary for survival can turn and cause your death at any moment.Sanity doesn't play a part in The Long Dark like it does in Don't Starve. Instead, there's a greater focus on surviving the elements. In Don't Starve, certain foods return a set amount of health points while certain items of clothing add different forms of protection against the elements. The Long Dark takes on a more serious simulation aspect, with calories, body temperature and other aspects of the in-game environment having an effect on the character. With a full day/night cycle and changing weather conditions, the player is forced to plan ahead and pay attention to the elements to avoid death.And like Don't Starve, death in The Long Dark is permanent, deleting the save leaving the player with no option but to start a new game. When it comes to survival, expect the unexpected. Each new game the player starts off in one of the game's six maps, with the items and wildlife being randomly spawned to ensure a unique experience each game. Fans of Don't Starve can expect the same challenging survival experience from The Long Dark.Oxygen Not Included is a space colonization game from Klei Entertainment, the same company that made Don't Starve. In Oxygen Not Included, the player starts off with three Duplicants –characters to control –, a rations box, and a limited amount of oxygen. The player's dupes can survive in this area for a while, but it's best to explore the asteroid, as oxygen and rations will run out eventually. By digging, the dupes can find resources, that will help them to establish a colony. As the base expands, however, the Duplicants will find and create things like polluted oxygen and water, unbreathable gases, exposure to diseases, and extreme temperature that will make life a bit harder for them.Almost as if managing resources isn't challenging enough, one of Oxygen Not Included's biggest challenges is managing the Duplicants themselves. As the base gets bigger, and the dupes' become exposed to the dangers of the asteroid, their stress increases. High stress equals unhappy dupes. As their stress level increases, they lose their efficiency in the colony. If a dupe reaches max stress, they begin disregarding their duties and doing things that are detrimental to the well-being of the colony, risking the stress of the other dupes. Over the course of the game, the player has a chance to accept more Duplicants, making building and exploring easier, but also adding to the strain of resources and chances to experience a stress-induced breakdown.Players of Oxygen Not Included, like Don't Starve, should expect to fail more times than they succeed. With each failure, however, knowledge into creating a prosperous colony is gained. Although still in Early Access, Oxygen Not Included proves itself to be a worthy follow-up to Don't Starve. More than just a survival game, Oxygen Not Included's in-depth colony management provides an entertaining and challenging experience for players looking for more out of their survival game.Don't Starve found great success among gamers thanks to its mix of survival, crafting, and adventure. Its brutally challenging character management system worked well with its intuitive, yet extensive crafting system. Few games have managed to create the same balance between their crafting and survival gameplay and enjoyability.Let us know what you loved most about Don't Starve as well as your favorite survival crafting games in the comments below!WriterAuthor: Jabulani BlydenThis feels like I'm writing a dating profile...

      "Don't Starve Together adds the highly requested multiplayer feature to Don't Starve. It was originally scheduled to come out in Summer 2014,[1] though a specific date was not given. However, sign-ups for a limited-access, closed Beta were released. It came out on Mac and Linux after being finalized on Windows.Starting December 15, 2014, Don't Starve Together Beta was in Steam Early Access, and on June 3, 2015, Don't Starve Together Early Access was released for free to owners of Don't Starve on Steam. It left early access and was fully released on April 21, 2016. Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together can be bought individually or as a bundle.Don't Starve Together: Console Edition is the PlayStation 4 port of Don't Starve Together.Don't Starve Together has multiple ways to play with others: LAN, network, and matchmaking play. Many items have been balanced or removed in order to keep the game fair. Game mode and PvP are optional by the server operator. Dedicated, player-hosted and LAN servers are available, and chat is global or local depending on the server admin's preference. A type of server called \"Friends Only\" allows a server to be created whereby the only people who can join have to be on the hosting player's Steam friends list. Many console commands have changed or been removed for DST.There are three game modes: Survival, Wilderness, and Endless. Additional game modes are possible with the use of mods.Survival is the default mode. It is intended to be a cooperative, more difficult mode, in which dead players become Ghost Characters that drain the sanity of living players by 3.3/min (up to 10/min total) for each ghost. Each player death will incur a maximum-health penalty, unless a Touch Stone, Life Giving Amulet, or Meat Effigy is used for resurrection. Maximum-health penalties can be cured by using Booster Shots. When all players are dead, a 120-second timer starts, and if no players are revived in that time, the world resets.Wilderness mode spawns players in random locations across the map. Players who die are returned to the character select screen, allowing them to respawn in a new random location as a new character with their map progress wiped. This is the only mode where players can respawn as a different character. No resurrection items exist, including touchstones (although their set pieces with pig heads will still be generated). The world never resets.Endless mode is intended to be a more relaxed mode that doesn't force players to cooperate. The world never resets, and players may resurrect themselves at the spawn portal when they die, as many times as they wish. However, it is not recommended to keep dying as each resurrection at the portal will cause a reduction to maximum-health, similar to the mechanic of death in Survival mode.Ghost Players are a new feature that introduces the ability to live after death, although in a downgraded state. Whenever a player dies, a skeleton spawns at their death point. Their inventory is dropped, and they become a ghost. Upon death, WX-78 also loses its upgrades.Ghosts can Haunt items and structures, possibly setting objects on fire, or affecting them in some other way. A ghost can be resurrected using a Touch Stone, Meat Effigy, Life Giving Amulet, Telltale Heart or Florid Postern Portal. Players may only resurrect through the Florid Postern Portal if the server is set to Endless Mode. When the ghost re-spawns, their inventory will be empty and their hunger and sanity are set to the same as resurrection in the base game. Re-spawning with the Telltale Heart or with the Florid Postern Portal will apply a 25% maximum health penalty on the player, which caps at 75% maximum health points (leaving the player with 25%). The health lost to this penalty can be restored by 25% using a Booster Shot. In Survival Mode, other players will suffer a continuous 3.3/min sanity drain for each ghost (up to 10/min total).Don't Starve Together features Caves and Ruins, which must be toggled on via a tab in the Server Creation menu. The Caves and Ruins now share the same map level, since separate servers are required to run a map level. The current build includes content from Reign of Giants and A New Reign. Shipwrecked is not implemented in DST, but some mods make a portion of the content available.Thermal stones now have durability, intended to represent cracks formed as a result of heating and cooling. Armor has less durability (by 30%) and can no longer be multiplicatively stacked as before; the game now uses the better armor's absorption and then divides the damage absorbed between the two worn armors weighted by their absorption. The Pan Flute now has the ability to knock other players besides the user unconscious for a short time, if PVP is enabled.Due to gears being a less available resource, WX-78 now starts with 150 health, sanity, and hunger, but each set of gears provide less of an upgrade (still bringing him to 300/400/200 overall after 15 upgrades).Willow has a large part of her advantages (and a few disadvantages) removed. These changes were mainly added due to the abuse of Willow burning things or attacking players in their first day. Willow's fire damage reduction is now only 50%, instead of 100%. Her lighter now lasts 1.25 days, but can be crafted. Willow no longer creates fires at low sanity and has a 10% boost on sanity gained from fire. However, this entire modification has created a generally negative response from the community. On June 3, 2015, Willow received more changes. She now gets colder when insane, is completely immune to fire for the first three seconds of exposure, can cook with her lighter (reducing its durability by 1%), can craft her lighter with fewer materials and starts the game with Bernie, the stuffed bear seen in her portrait.Woodie's Wood meter is now present at all times, which serves to warn players of the Werebeaver; once the Wood meter reaches 25, the transformation occurs. Woodie can eat Grass, Twigs, and Logs to replenish the Wood meter. The Werebeaver loses many of its benefits, discouraging its usability for griefing and PvP. The Werebeaver now shares Woodie's Health and Sanity meters, and the Wood meter replaces the Hunger meter. Letting the Wood meter reach zero induces the same health drain as letting the Hunger meter reach zero. Death in the Werebeaver form is true death; Woodie becomes a beaver-looking ghost but still cannot use the map, making it harder to revive oneself. His sanity drains incredibly quickly, about 3/second, making it far less beneficial to stay transformed. To turn back into Woodie the player must get the Wood meter back to 100. However, the Werebeaver can no longer eat Pine Cones, Grass Tufts, Saplings and the like. To make up for the changes, Woodie gains Sanity from planting trees, and Lucy the Axe cannot be used or even picked up by other players. During a Full Moon, Woodie instantly transforms into the Werebeaver as he would normally in Don't Starve. However, during the Full Moon, the Wood meter decreases rapidly, even after the player has managed to fill the meter and exit Werebeaver state, making it rather difficult, but possible, to obtain Glommer's Flower. The rate at which the wood meter depletes is unknown.Maxwell now comes only with his Codex Umbra and 6 Nightmare Fuel. His Sanity boost has been reduced from 20/min to 6.67/min. The Shadow Tab was added, in which one can craft the Codex and different types of puppets. Puppets cost 2 Nightmare Fuel, a tool matching their action, and 20% (worker) or 35% (duelist) of Maxwell's maximum sanity.Many mobs have had their health increased:Several new entities were added to rebalance characters, giants, and seasonal mechanics for the multiplayer aspect of the game:Sleeping has been significantly changed. Normally, when going to sleep, the day would fast-forward to sunrise and replenish health and sanity at the cost of hunger upon waking up. However, when on a server, sleeping will not fast forward to sunrise but will instead leave the player unable to move and unaffected by the night monster. This will replenish health and sanity while draining hunger faster than normal over time; the rate at which will be dependent on what type of structure or item was used to sleep. When using a normal sleeping item, the player can wake themselves up by trying to move. If the player was put to sleep (pan flute, cooking a mandrake, etc.), they will reawaken after a small amount of time. The player will always wake up if hunger reaches 0.The Map has been modified to include a fog of war, preventing players to see changes to remote locations in the map. Each player's explored areas are tracked separately, however players can share their exploration with others using Map Scrolls.Players communicate and express themselves through two chat modes: global chat (accessed via \"Y\" key by default) and local \"whisper\" chat (accessed via \"U\" key by default). Global chat is seen by all players, whether they are up on the Surface world or down inside Caves. Whispered messages, on the other hand, can only be seen by players who are in the vicinity of the speaker. Whispered chat looks the same as global chat, but the word \"Whisper\" is displayed before it.Emotes are used by entering their respective commands in chat: /sad, /cry, /annoyed, /rude, /bye, /angry, /happy, /kiss, /bonesaw, /dance, /wave, /facepalm, /joy, /pose, /sit, and /squat. Each emote will trigger an animation by the player's character.Special skin emotes such as /yawn and /sleepy, or /eyerub, are rewarded to players who have certain sets of Skin items in their collection.In addition, special Loyal quality emotes exist, such as /swoon.Attacking players, giving players items, and reviving ghosts is tracked by the game and can impact what other characters say about said player when inspecting them. For example, if Willow were to inspect a harmless Wilson she would say, \"Hi (playername)!\". But had he been attacking someone, she would say, \"Why, (playername)... that fire in your eyes!\" Or if a player has been reviving other players, she will say \"(playername) won't leave anyone behind.\".A new developer, Peter, has been hired almost solely for Modding. Don't Starve Together supports mods, yet many of them that rewrite core Don't Starve code must update to the new DST format. In DST, there are three kinds of mods:A new feature of Don't Starve Together is the option to change the appearance of players' characters with different Skins. For example, players are able to customize pants, shirts, shoes, gloves, and facial appearance for their character. Players can choose what Skins their character will wear in-game in the Character Select screen, and they can change their Skins in-game using a Wardrobe. Skins are for aesthetics-use only and do not have a function in-game, apart from enabling Skin emotes. All Skins are non-gender-specific.Skins are obtainable through random drops while playing the game, up to 4 per week. The weekly reset occurs around 1pm PST every Thursday, right before Klei's weekly Twitch broadcast.Skins exist of various types and of various rarities, providing a strong sense of individuality to players. Some Skins are character-specific and drop very rarely. Others exist for items and structures, such as for Backpacks and Chests. Some Skins are only obtainable through special means.A free DLC originally called Through the Ages was announced for Spring 2015, and contains new content specifically made for multiplayer, such as mounting Beefalo using saddles.[2] However, due to complications with implementing Cave biomes, Klei pushed back the release date. After the Caves made their way into DST and the game went out of Early Access, the DLC was once again announced, now under the name \"A New Reign\", and is being distributed as a frequent, ongoing series of updates.[3] Some of the features that are officially part of the DLC were incorporated into the game via update on December 23, 2015, much earlier than the Beta Launch of the DLC, August 11, 2016.Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, and Saplings now each have an alternate form (Juicy Berry Bushes, Grass Gekkos, and Twiggy Trees, respectively). The alternate forms can co-exist with normal forms, providing additional methods of obtaining the respective resource, or an alternative resource in the case of Juicy Berry Bushes.Plants that have been dug up and replanted can become Diseased, which can then spread to nearby plants if the diseased plant is not disposed of. Additionally, sometimes an area will gradually have all of its trees petrified, after which they must be mined instead of chopped. Petrified Trees drop Rocks, Flint and Nitre when mined, similar to Boulders.Beefalo can now be domesticated. While in the process of domestication, they can be ridden using a Saddle. The Saddlehorn aids in keeping saddles undamaged, and the Brush helps with the domestication process. The Salt Lick keeps the obedience of Beefalo high. See Beefalo - Don't Starve Together for more information.With the official release of the game, a new comic was released in which one must complete a series of puzzles to keep following along. The story takes place right after the ending of the adventure mode, when Wilson frees Maxwell from the throne. It is revealed that Charlie saved Wilson from the throne and sent him back to the Wilderness, taking the throne for herself and thus becoming the main antagonist of Don't Starve Together.Wilson's \"happy\" animationWilson's \"sad\" animationWilson's \"kiss\" animationWilson's \"annoyed\" animationWilson's \"bonesaw\" animationWilson's \"dance\" animationWilson's \"facepalm\" animationWilson's mad scientist skin.Different drafts of Wilson's pajama skin.Wilson's younger self skin.Wilson's Invisible Man skin.An unnamed Wilson skinNinja Wilson and WX-78's ninja skins (possibly a reference to Mark of the Ninja)Willow's orphan skin.Willow's Burnt skin.Different drafts of Wendy's Girl Scout skin.Wendy's funeral skin.Wendy's creepy skin.Wendy's robot skin showcasing different concept palettes.

      "Don't Starve is a wilderness survival game from Klei Entertainment originally released in 2013. Initially only available on PC, it has since been released in several other formats since 2013 including WiiU, XBox One, PS4, PS3 and PS Vita.The game stars a number of different characters who have all been transported to a strange world by a demonic creature known simply as Maxwell. The player takes on the role of one of the stranded characters and must survive from day to day by foraging for food and supplies, forging equipment and dealing with the various perils of the Don't Starve world which include changing weather and seasons, environmental hazards, and physical and supernatural monsters, all whilst trying to keep healthy, well fed and mentally stable.Don't Starve features a strong rogue-like element, with perma-death and little in game help or instruction making surviving the game's randomly generated wilderness both tough and unforgiving. It's relatively well known for an Indie game, mainly thanks to a number of lets-plays on Youtube, and features a unique Tim Burton-inspired gothic-cartoon art style.After the success of Don't Starve several expansions have since been released:Reign of Giants is the first expansion, adding new characters, items and environments to the basic Don't Starve game, but increasing difficulty and adding giant seasonal monsters. Both this expansion and the base game were also released together as Don't Starve: Giants Edition on several games consoles.Don's Starve Together is a standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, featuring all the content of Don't Starve and Reign of Giants but with the ability for several players to play together either cooperatively or competitively online. Several tweaks were implemented to try and balance the game for multiple players.Don't Starve Shipwrecked is another expansion for Don't Starve, featuring more new characters, items and environments, and is set in a sea/desert island biome.Don't Starve: Pocket Edition is a iOS port of Don't Starve: Giant's Edition.window.addEvent(\"domready\", function()\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tnew OverText($('login_username'), {poll:true});\n\t\t\tnew OverText($('login_password'), {poll:true});\n\t\t});\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegisterBoard Games\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRPGs\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVideo Games\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\nRecent Additions\nWiki\n\n\nPlatforms\n\nAll\nWindows\nPlayStation 3\nXbox 360\niPhone\nWii\nAndroid\nNintendo 3DS\nPlayStation Vita\nPlayStation 4\nWii U\nXbox One\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLogin\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tSEARCH\n\t\t\t\t\n\nAll\nVideo Games\nPlatforms\nHardware\nFranchise\nSeries\nThemes\nGenres\nCharacters\nDevelopers\nPublishers\nForums\nGeekLists\nTags\nWiki\nUsers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdv.

survival game from Klei Entertainment originally released in 2013. Initially only available on PC, it has since been released in several other formats since 2013 including WiiU, XBox One, PS4, PS3 and PS Vita.\nThe game stars a number of different characters who have all been transported to a strange world by a demonic creature known simply as Maxwell. The player takes on the role of one of the stranded characters and must survive from day to day by foraging for food and supplies, forging equipment and dealing with the various perils of the Don't Starve world which include changing weather and seasons, environmental hazards, and physical and supernatural monsters, all whilst trying to keep healthy, well fed and mentally stable.\nDon't Starve features a strong rogue-like element, with perma-death and little in game help or instruction making surviving the game's randomly generated wilderness both tough and unforgiving. It's relatively well known for an Indie game, mainly thanks to a number of lets-plays on Youtube, and features a unique Tim Burton-inspired gothic-cartoon art style.\nAfter the success of Don't Starve several expansions have since been released:\nReign of Giants is the first expansion, adding new characters, items and environments to the basic Don't Starve game, but increasing difficulty and adding giant seasonal monsters. Both this expansion and the base game were also released together as Don't Starve: Giants Edition on several games consoles.\nDon's Starve Together is a standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, featuring all the content of Don't Starve and Reign of Giants but with the ability for several players to play together either cooperatively or competitively online. Several tweaks were implemented to try and balance the game for multiple players.\nDon't Starve Shipwrecked is another expansion for Don't Starve, featuring more new characters, items and environments, and is set in a sea/desert island biome.\nDon't Starve: Pocket Edition is a iOS port of Don't Starve: Giant's Edition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharacters\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[Add Character]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[Browse]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPg. 1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Character Found\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore Information\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEdit |\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page does not exist.

survival game from Klei Entertainment originally released in 2013. Initially only available on PC, it has since been released in several other formats since 2013 including WiiU, XBox One, PS4, PS3 and PS Vita.\nThe game stars a number of different characters who have all been transported to a strange world by a demonic creature known simply as Maxwell. The player takes on the role of one of the stranded characters and must survive from day to day by foraging for food and supplies, forging equipment and dealing with the various perils of the Don't Starve world which include changing weather and seasons, environmental hazards, and physical and supernatural monsters, all whilst trying to keep healthy, well fed and mentally stable.\nDon't Starve features a strong rogue-like element, with perma-death and little in game help or instruction making surviving the game's randomly generated wilderness both tough and unforgiving. It's relatively well known for an Indie game, mainly thanks to a number of lets-plays on Youtube, and features a unique Tim Burton-inspired gothic-cartoon art style.\nAfter the success of Don't Starve several expansions have since been released:\nReign of Giants is the first expansion, adding new characters, items and environments to the basic Don't Starve game, but increasing difficulty and adding giant seasonal monsters. Both this expansion and the base game were also released together as Don't Starve: Giants Edition on several games consoles.\nDon's Starve Together is a standalone multiplayer version of Don't Starve, featuring all the content of Don't Starve and Reign of Giants but with the ability for several players to play together either cooperatively or competitively online. Several tweaks were implemented to try and balance the game for multiple players.\nDon't Starve Shipwrecked is another expansion for Don't Starve, featuring more new characters, items and environments, and is set in a sea/desert island biome.\nDon't Starve: Pocket Edition is a iOS port of Don't Starve: Giant's Edition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCharacters\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[Add Character]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[Browse]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPg. 1\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Character Found\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore Information\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nEdit |\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page does not exist.

|\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Starve is a wilderness survival game from Klei Entertainment originally released in 2013. Initially only available on PC, it has since been released in several other formats since 2013 including WiiU, XBox One, PS4, PS3 and PS Vita.\nThe game stars a number of different characters who have all been transported to a strange world by a demonic creature known simply as Maxwell. The player takes on the role of one of the stranded characters and must survive from day to day by foraging for food and supplies, forging equipment and dealing with the various perils of the Don't Starve world which include changing weather and seasons, environmental hazards, and physical and supernatural monsters, all whilst trying to keep healthy, well fed and mentally stable.\nDon't Starve features a strong rogue-like element, with perma-death and little in game help or instruction making surviving the game's randomly generated wilderness both tough and unforgiving.

Initially only available on PC, it has since been released in several other formats since 2013 including WiiU, XBox One, PS4, PS3 and PS Vita.\nThe game stars a number of different characters who have all been transported to a strange world by a demonic creature known simply as Maxwell. The player takes on the role of one of the stranded characters and must survive from day to day by foraging for food and supplies, forging equipment and dealing with the various perils of the Don't Starve world which include changing weather and seasons, environmental hazards, and physical and supernatural monsters, all whilst trying to keep healthy, well fed and mentally stable.\nDon't Starve features a strong rogue-like element, with perma-death and little in game help or instruction making surviving the game's randomly generated wilderness both tough and unforgiving.

      "Indie game news, reviews, previews & developer interviewsadvertisementWe held off reviewing Don’t Starve from Vancouver-based indie game developers Klei Entertainment for this long because we wanted to wait and see just what, exactly, it would become – the game’s development path is a decidedly modern one in this age of crowdfunding and early access paid betas, but a little different. We are glad we held out; with several months of release on Steam under its belt, we feel the game is substantive enough, and “settled into place” sufficiently to deserve a review in earnest, having now demonstrated what it will ultimately become.Let’s dial the time-wheel back a little to better understand what that means…It all began innocently enough: When we first saw Don’t Starve at PAX Prime 2012, it was in a small corner of Klei Entertainment’s booth near the indie wing of the huge convention center, where community manager Corey Rollins was passing out business cards beside a simple table with a 22″ HD display running a demo of the game. When I asked him about the Edward Gorey-styled paper-cutout images moving onscreen to a macabre 1920’s carnival soundtrack – likely of shock-haired Mr. Wilson running from spiders through a burning forest, he uttered, quite obviously by rote: “Don’t Starve is an uncompromising wilderness survival game full of science and magic.”Watch IGR’s original video interview about Don’t Starve with Corey Rollins at PAX Prime 2012:Rollins mentioned that it was already available for purchase on the Google Chrome store as a paid beta and that they would be rolling out regular updates in anticipation of their Steam launch sometime later in the year or as late as Q1 2013.I went back to my hotel and instantly purchased it for US$13.00 which also awarded me a second copy I could gift to a friend, which I immediately passed along to my PAX colleague. I started playing it that night, and couldn’t stop. The game was uncompromising indeed, but hours later, I realized that in spite of its early development state, there was something about the game that successfully balanced all the most addictive elements of a game – easy to pick up with fast-scaling complexity, logical but interesting tech trees, short and long range goals, discovery, mystery, causality and the non-linear challenge of seeing how long you could last before your own idiosyncratic impulses led to your untimely and irreversible demise in an open world.A tall, thin man in a pinstriped suit welcomes Wilson (or on of several other unlockable characters) in the midst of the wilderness, with naught but the clothes on his back. The first stages of his survival require him to gather food, and materials for a fire that can last through the night. To accomplish these tasks, the player can mouse over various items on the screen and click to interact with them. Some will result in picking up a resource that can be used or combined with other elements. Others (such as trees and large rocks) might require the acquiring of buildable axes, pickaxes or shovels as the case may be, before they can be manipulated.By climbing this gradual hierarchy of needs, Wilson can eventually create a Science Machine, allowing for the creation of more advanced implements. While the milestone is impressive, the new creations should be pursued with caution, as Wilson will still meticulously gravitate towards malnourishment without the occasional roasted rabbit or two.I learned this the hard way. After a series of moderately successful rounds of survival, I encountered my first gold nugget, and eagerly constructed my mechanical brain-booster. I toiled over new tools and niceties well into the night. It wasn’t until I noticed that my health was plummeting that it dawned on me: It had been nearly a full two days since the last time I trapped a rabbit. Scouring my inventory revealed that all of my edibles had gone into my brainy exploits. My quest ended, and I was returned to the title screen. Oh, right…Don’t Starve…In hindsight, The Science Machine was but the tip of the iceberg. The Alchemy Engine opens a second tier of goods that be can prototyped from more refined materials. Whip up a crock pot, an ice box, and a drying rack. Not only will you be able to keep meat from spoiling for longer, but by combining meats and veggies, you can whip up tasty treats that come packed with boosts to all three attributes.Should you choose to explore the entirety of the crafting tree (note: it gains branches with every content update), the capability is there for Wilson to create a wealth of helpful items that will assist him in farming, the preservation of food, and weaponry, but only if he doesn’t first keel over from hunger.This delicate balance is what generates the real challenge. You’ll need to scavenge and hunt to keep your belly from shriveling into a husk, but you need to make discoveries and create new items to keep your mind active. While a starvation death makes for a far more drastic end, losing your mental focus will result in the emergence of ethereal shadow beasties. They’ll only lurk near you at first, but for each Cocoa Puff you drop in the insanity bowl, they get more and more substantial.Eventually, you’ll be battling it out with invisible critters that can nevertheless sink their fangs into you. Also keep in mind that every time you start a new game, (which will be often when you first get going), the world is randomly-generated. There are extensive controls for tailoring in what way it may be generated, adding biases for certain elements etc.In some games I had a world of grassy pastures patrolled by manure-dropping beefalos, while others were chock-full of pig-men and spiders at war with one another.In some there were gold nuggets literally laying about as if they were raining down from the sky, while others I couldn’t mine a gold vein if my life depended on it, which made any scientific research impossible and starved me out intellectually, rather than physically.All of the beasts (real or shadowy) share a cartoon-like whimsy. Most of them look rather harmless, but getting too close or carelessly lashing out at any of them can result in a quick death, or a run that will take you far from camp. Some beasts will require you to develop some hefty upgrades before they can be feasibly confronted, but most of them are going to trounce you if you’re fool enough to challenge a pack.Not all critters automatically want to eat your face. Some can be bargained with, and might even toss a few haymakers about should a nefarious brood of pack animals decide you smell delicious. There’s nothing worse than getting gang-mauled and having your carefully constructed slice-o’-paradise go to waste, so make friends and don’t be afraid to sweeten the deal with a savory morsel here and there. You can even gain the knowledge of how to construct domiciles that will attract allies; think of it as a primitive barracks at the edge of town.GAMEPLAY TIPS: Specifically – while you can attack and carve up the pig-men for a late bacon snack, you may consider keeping your faction with them on the happy side, and build your HQ nearby – this way, when the nasty follering-dog-pack comes nipping at your heels, you can kite them through the pig village and have the oinks do all the dirty work.Alternatively, and perhaps the better solution, is to build your HQ in a savannah, near a dense cluster or rabbit holes, and then, once you are far enough up the tech tree, build a hammer and break down some pig houses to relocate nearby. This way you will have a steady supply of food to dry on meat drying racks (that produce jerky) to get you through the long winter. Don’t forget to lay as many traps as you can over those rabbit holes though!Gameplay Tip Caveat Emptor\nShould you choose to indeed build your nest near the pig folk, be sure to keep a watchful eye on the moon phase, as when it becomes full, your snorting buddies will turn into were-creatures for a good two minutes and are very dangerous and difficult to outrun. During this period, you may want to camp out in a remote location, and return after the moon begins to wane. Note that you may also trigger their dark side by feeding them too much monster meat (4 units actually). Besides this dangerous eventuality, however, they make good chums to keep about.In the event that you are having trouble making friends with any of the strange creatures in the strange land you are inhabiting, there are (sometimes) shrines that you can tap which will allow you to resurrect your character, albeit without all of the materials he or she has so painstakingly gathered. Alternatively you can build a meat effigy deeper along the tech tree. Perhaps the gods of Don’t Starve are merciful after all?And this sense of loss – rez spots or otherwise – is where the game will polarize players – some may find it simply far too exasperating to lose so much time with nothing to show for it but some daft memories, and maybe a character unlock. Others will find this is survival, time-management game a big slice of Heaven pie…Don’t Starve may not be for everyone – for those who hate grinding, this is anathema. Essentially, it can become a game predominantly about grinding. Then again, I remember when Everquest 2 decided to offer two paths – the adventurer path and the craftsman. At the time I thought – why would anyone want to forego hack-n-slashing Orcs to go mushroom picking instead?Well, I got schooled. Gathering and hunting is a noble and exciting path all its own, and this is what Don’t Starve relies on, because what combat there is, is decidedly unfair in the enemy’s favor, and provisional at best. By the way, this is not a criticism of the combat, it is a necessity in the world of the play as it heightens the nightmare belaboring your character – like trying to run from a killer, but not ever gaining any momentum. In fact, the false sense of security that spears, fire darts and twine armor afford, is an ingenious way of heightening the sense of fear, urgency, dread and suspense in the 2D world Klei has created.For those who find time and resource management and experimentation the height of entertainment, Klei has created a gift for you wrapped up in big pink bows. Striking a careful balance between your hunger, health and sanity is addressed in a manner far more creative and generous than simple gauges that rise and fall (there are now mods that allow you to repurpose the GUI for when you mean business) – they have gone a step further to artfully craft the symptoms of their effects into the very fabric of the experience.Once you have got your bearings, figured out the tech trees, and maybe even made it through winter, having crafted some bunny muffs, a puffy jacket and a barbecue, with your trusty heat stone safely stowed on your person, it may be time to finally leave the endlessly fascinating variation of the sandbox and find out just what in the darkest of hecks is actually going on.Because in fact, that tall man in the pin-striped suit you met way back at the beginning of this Count of Monte Cristo-like prison? His name is Maxwell, and he means you no good. In fact in a sort of JJ Abrams style twist of fate, you may in fact be a pawn in some far deeper endgame, and the only hope of respite for your soul, is to track him down and figure out what it is he wants from you after all.Suddenly the game opens up into a whole new scale, as you discover a strange mechanical device marked “Maxwell’s Door” and upon engaging it are warned that you are about to leave the little concept of a world you have thus far fashioned, behind – along with everything you have so meticulously gathered – and leap into a far more perilous odyssey.I can’t divulge much more here without spoiling things for you, dear reader, but the comprehensive Don’t Starve Wiki will be more than happy to do that for you, along with answering hundreds of questions you may have accumulated by this point.Needless to say, many may never even arrive at this campaign mode, but it is rather remarkable that an entirely separate kind of game exists beyond the initial scenario to which you are presented.Six months after my first taste, the company had released a series of updates and patches, all of which added substantial new gameplay elements – weather, mental health gauges, new beasties, additional crafting, rich modding tools, and even a new underworld (still a work-in-progress), all of which also recursively improved the way they had been done up until that point.Many suggestions came from the user forums, and many of those were considered or addressed in some way directly by the developers. This long paid beta, and wide-open transparent dialogue with the public was a very alluring and evidently successful collaborative method for improving the game in the direction that its demographic desired, but never cowing to their every whim – thus maintaining its integrity whilst demonstrating the framework to be adaptable.I stepped away from the game in this time, just to give it some breathing room in hopes that I could see it more clearly as the full game it was destined to become, and I was simply astonished by the amount that was added from the time I first got hooked all those months before. It had already been a fun, engaging, and highly replayable title, but now it had enough variety that even two good solid nights of play still had not revealed all that there was to discover. Indeed a year later, this remains true.I will say, that every so often, on my Quadcore laptop with integrated AMD graphics, the game can sometimes choke up a little, and I have to close all other running applications or restart the game. Other times, when I would try to plant something, Wilson seemed unsure of what I wanted and would stutter back and forth in place until I reclicked in a spot that pleased him. Perhaps this is intentional, but it looked glitchy, and not something that should be happening this late into release.I am not exactly sure I can blame it on the game, but it may be a little further optimization is required on the dev’s side. It most definitely is not a killer, but it is there and worth mentioning, as so much timing and precision is required to beat the three clocks you have constantly ticking down, and stand to lose so much, that smooth gameplay is a must with this title.For example, when you have only moments of daylight left and your fire needs to be built and you left it too late, you could technically build a campfire, but if clicking doesn’t happen in a split second, all goes dark and you are going to die at the hand of the boogeymen. At one point I was trying to click on my logs to add fuel to my campfire, but they would not pick up, and then there was no turning back, so yes, precision and timing matters and any lag on the game’s part can cause you to lose hours upon hours of work.Only for this reason, and the fact that it may not appeal to everyone for its “uncompromising,” unforgivingly grindish mechanic does it not get the perfect score it otherwise more than deserves.In fact Don’t Starve is easily one of the most engaging and entertaining games of 2013 or any year, in any category – the artwork, with its Georges Méliès styled undulating ocean waves, the beautifully sinister Klezmer soundtrack and woodwind-voiced avatars, the time management game design are all creatively first-rate and compose a deliciously villainous universe to romp around and tinker with. The animations all feature lovely subtle variation, and every object in the world feels alive, even expressive – from the way the trees pop up or shrivel, to the vast array of critters fluttering, skittering, crawling and stalking about, all with unique proximity responses to your player character.The updates keep coming – new characters have been added, along with new craftables, whole new zone types (the bunny caves which can be accessed by mining randomly placed sinkholes), all manner of creatures and “power-ups”. What Klei has done is defined, in the best way, a new legitimate way of procedural game development; rather than charge a smaller sum for these expansions under the guise of downloadable content (aka the ubiquitous “DLC”), they simply keep expanding the original idea with a healthy dose of feedback, suggestions and requests from the growing fan base. It is a case study in how to do this right.A little over a year since I first started playing Don’t Starve, I feel like I have barely scratched its necessarily multi-terrain surface – the same surface that now covers an even more mysterious subterranean adventure and answers to questions, so very many questions…I’m coming for you Maxwell. We are late, for a very important date.With additional contributions by CallabrantusRating:advertisementView previous campaigns.Powered by MailChimpadvertisementLast Post:Next Post:This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

      "For Halloween, October 31st 2013, the developers released a mod titled 'The Screecher' with a new story and character.Don't Starve is an action-adventure game with a randomly generated open world and elements of survival and roguelike gameplay. Combat is handled by pointing and clicking with the mouse while other activities are controlled by the keyboard, or using the inbuilt gamepad support to play using a controller, giving it a console-like gameplay feel. The goal is to survive as long as possible, with a count of the number of days the player has survived shown onscreen. The game keeps few records of player progress besides the total number of experience points and the playable characters unlocked.Similar to the Slender games, the mod focuses on William 'Bill' Moran as he finds himself stranded on a desert island and must survive whilst being tracked down by a monster known as 'The Screecher.'Jack made sixteen episodes of the original series, before returning in October 2013 to play the horror mod."

      "Rogue Legacy is a 2013 platform game with roguelike elements developed by Cellar Door Games. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, Linux, OS X, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Xbox One.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe goal of Rogue Legacy is to explore a randomly generated dungeon, defeat four bosses in each of the four unique environments of the dungeon, and then defeat the final boss. Characters have the default ability to jump and slash with their sword, along with secondary abilities, such as magic attacks, which use mana.Whenever a character dies as a result of losing all of their Hit Points (HP), control will transfer over to one of three randomly generated heirs which the player may choose between, though this number may be increased to six with a later upgrade. Each descendant carries their unique characteristics and abilities, including such genetic peculiarities as color-blindness (in which the game is presented in black and white), ADHD (in which the player moves faster) and dwarfism (in which the character is short and can fit into small gaps).\nGold found while exploring the castle can be used to improve the character's equipment and abilities, which are passed on to that character's heirs. Gold can be found by smashing pieces of furniture, opening chests, or defeating enemies. There are also various fairy chests hidden in special rooms throughout the castle, most of which require the player to complete an objective, such as taking no damage in the room, in order to be opened.\nSpending gold on the manor, which appears after a new heir is chosen, can increase stats, such as health and mana, and unlock and upgrade new classes that may be carried by one of the heirs. These include mages, which can use more advanced spells, warriors, who have higher strength, and assassins, who can use various stealth techniques and have an increased likelihood of having a critical hit.\nGold can unlock the blacksmith, the enchantress and the architect, who each provide their own services. The blacksmith can use blueprints found in the castle to create new armor and equipment for the player, improving their stats. Similarly, the enchantress can use runes found in fairy chests to give the player enhancements, unlocking additional abilities such as double jumping and dashing. Finally, the architect can lock down the design of a previously encountered castle (so that a new one isn't randomly generated) in exchange for a percentage of any gold found.\nAny unspent gold must be paid to Charon in order to enter the castle, though upgrades can reduce the amount required to pay.\n\n\n=== Additional content ===\nThe game features a progressing \"New Game +\" feature, in which every completion of the game along a specific line of descendants increases the difficulty while also increasing the rewards offered by enemies and chests. After the second completion, the format for the name is \"New Game +n\" where n is the number of playthroughs since the first (Begins at +2, then +3, etc.). Notably, while enemies increase in difficulty theoretically forever, bosses do not get any harder across playthroughs. Furthermore, the player cannot normally increase in power beyond a certain point, though small increases to various stats beyond this soft-cap are possible through the \"Fairy Chests\" system.\nA number of secret bosses exist, all of which are remixed versions of each of the ordinary bosses. Upon defeating all of the secret ordinary bosses, one may challenge the secret version of the final boss in order to unlock the secret \"Traitor\" class, based on the first form of the final boss.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was developed by Cellar Door Games, a Toronto-based developer consisting of brothers Kenny and Teddy Lee. This was the brothers' biggest project to date and took 18 months to develop. The game was inspired by such titles as Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. Teddy compares the design to games like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac, noting that their goal was to make the game relatively forgiving and accessible, while also allowing permanent progression. Due to the need to streamline the game, several prominent features were cut during development, including an experience system. Kenny added that the revenue from the game will allow them to focus on larger future projects.The game cost the team about $15,000 of their own money to develop, all of which was earned back within an hour of release. Rogue Legacy went on to sell more than 100,000 copies within the first week.Most versions of the game were done in-house. However, the Xbox One version was ported by Abstraction Games.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn December 2014, Cellar Door Games teamed up with IndieBox, a monthly subscription box service, to produce an exclusive physical release of Rogue Legacy. This limited, individually-numbered collector’s edition included a flash-drive with a DRM-free game file, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual and Steam key, as well as several custom-designed collectible items.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\nMetacritic gives the game a \"generally favorable\" score of 85/100 based on 43 reviews. GameRankings gives the game a score of 84 based on 26 reviews.Mitchell Saltzman of GameFront describes the game as \"insanely hard for the unprepared\". Philip Kollar of Polygon and Mike Splechta of GameZone mentioned the short life spans of their characters, and Scott Nichols of Digital Spy expressed frustration when first starting out. Other reviewers remarked that the game actually encourages these short runs while rewarding the player via the broader progression system. Ryan Stevens of GameTrailers described the game as \"[riding] the line of frustration and fun\". Saltzman concludes that \"difficulty may be a turnoff to those who get frustrated easily\".Lady Faye IV will be a playable character in the game Hex Heroes for the Wii U.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nDeveloper Cellar Door Games website",
      "PREAMBLEThese aren’t your standard design notes. Not only are they barely legible, but these are much, much lamer. This is also NOT how standard games are made. We’re two brothers who worked with one another at home, and we used Skype to communicate with the artist and musicians. Once you expand to a larger development team, things might fall apart. We also wing a lot of things… A LOT.Rogue Legacy required about 2 month of time to develop a basic engine and level editor to support the game we wanted to make. It was during this time when the majority of the core for Rogue Legacy was designed. So for this game, the concept was literally being made in conjunction with the tools that would be required to build it. Sort of a chicken or the egg scenario.***A lot of these notes were for the preliminary design. Additional notes were made as development of Rogue Legacy progressed, but they were more specific to individual issues that arose during production. Also these notes aren’t in chronological order. We don’t know what the correct order is.Teddy Lee\nCreative DesignerThis note talks more about our old skill tree design.Rogue Legacy’s skill tree design was originally planned to be closer to Kingdom Rush, and we called the skills “Totems”. As you placed skills in the lower parts of the totems, the higher up skills unlocked, thus the name.This system seems weird now, but back then the format for the game’s main progression wasn’t designed. We wanted to make defeating bosses extremely rewarding, so they originally unlocked additional totems for the player to “skill up”.Below that is a list of bonuses these “totem skills” would reward the player with. It’s not an exhaustive list because details like that in the early design phase aren’t necessary. Instead, what’s important is to show exactly how FAR REACHING an effect you wanted the skill tree to have on the game.  Macro focus over micro.The original design for the growing skill tree.  It was literally a tree.You can see from the notes that we were aiming for mostly passive skills. But even though they were passive, each listed skill had its own unique set of implementation rules that (in my mind) were important enough to look out for because they may have been tricky to code (I’m not a programmer).IE.Points 2,3,4 I don’t remember what the heck these are. Looks stupid.Manor vs. TotemWe also have the creation of the character classes here. So you can see that the original concept had knights which could block damage, and the Hokages which could Phase Shift. We had another class who could do charge attacks, but that was killed off early on. The dash move, on the other hand, got re-fitted into the Rune system that was later designed.You can also see the original control layout for the game. The B button used to be the Class-specific ability, and Y was potion (we originally wanted the player to be able to use consumable potions).A lot of the stuff here got cleaned up in the final version of the game and simplified.  As explained above, Dash became a Rune, the Y button became the Class-specific ability, and the skills were turned into single-press actions instead of direction-and-press (for some).  And potions became instant consumables.All of these original design concepts never actually got into production. We always re-examine our game while in development and often cut ideas before we waste time prototyping them. That’s a another reason why we don’t really care for design documents. They cut down on our ability to stay agile.A lot of people say it’s important to prototype (which it is), but it’s also important to have directed prototyping. If you’re working on something that has a 10% chance of getting in the game, then it’s a waste of time. So making cuts like these are massive time and money savers.The concept of Fairy Chests were written here. Along with it came the concept of the rune system.\nThe rune system was to allow people to bind the same type of rune onto a person, and let it scale infinitely.The original idea for runes was a bit more ambitious in terms of what they could do.  For example, one rune would give spike immunity, and adding additional runes would give alternate forms of immunity. Of course that cannot scale infinitely, so we thought about binding runes to a max of 5.  That still kept the immunity idea really complicated, not only to code, but to display to the user.  So we cut all of the rune ideas which could not naturally scale to infinity, in order to make a cleaner system.The spike immunity eventually went on to become a special item (Hermes boots).Hermes boots is legacy from when the game’s story had a much stronger Roman theme to it. As we iterated on the plot, we decided to reduce the amount of specific cultural references to allow us to have a bit more creative freedom.The EndThat’s it. Hope you enjoyed reading all this boring stuff!This was the design note written out for how the procedural map generator would work.It’s very light on text, just keywords to refresh my memory. From my experience, having long-winded explanations don’t really help.  This is true for a number of reasons:When things are written on paper, it also adds this imaginary weight to the idea.  Like, just because it’s been recorded it is now official and more important and valuable than the conversations spoken.  I know that sounds silly, but it’s true. Or at least I think it’s true. True enough for me.Also, things will never go according to what’s written.  It’s impossible to predict how difficult an idea is to implement, or how costly, or how time-consuming.  And if you have a design doc, it just adds an extra step to the game development process.When you’re designing something, especially something that’s complex, it’s best to keep it detail-light. That way when the input from the other team members are heard, changes can be made on the fly. Also, people will always strive to be lazy, not dumb. They’ll try to remember an idea that was mentioned, and if they forget, they’ll ask. Nobody wants to scrounge through a 60-page, massively detailed design doc to find that one sentence which possibly answer their question.**** Once again I’d like to reiterate that this is how we make games. And it probably won’t work for any teams larger than like… 5.This page is just a clean-up page. While doing the macro design for a game, you’ll visualize in your head a bunch of different aspects, and your notes will be all over the place. This page acted as sort of a mental clean-up, like a “Cliff Notes” that summarized my ideas to make sure nothing was missing.Doing a summary of your ideas is also a great way to tighten things up, because when you force yourself to really think through the game in a step-by-step process, you’ll start to see redundancies. Doing an overview of the whole thing allows you to combine or remove components from the game that may not need to be separate ideas, or have become obsolete.Below that note, there is a very light diorama explaining combat, and below that was the beginning of the Architect!We knew we wanted a way to “lock down” parts of the game but still provide a new experience with each playthrough.  The first concept was to lock down specific castle zones after defeating a boss. It was tossed out early due to the fact that:At the top of this attached note page you can see additional examples of the talents (i.e old traits).Below the note on talents was our “New Loss System”.  As mentioned earlier, Rogue Legacy originally had XP and gold. Gold was used to upgrade the totems (which became the manor). This gold stayed with you with each life.  The XP was reset, and unless you leveled, all your XP would go back to 0 on death.Every time you leveled up your base stats raised, and there would be an algorithm to make sure the player could go up an infinite amount of levels. This system was overly complicated, and the things we wanted XP to do in our game from a flow perspective weren’t working.It was a hard decision, but we decided the best route was to remove one of the forms of “currency” entirely. So we chucked XP, turned gold into the sole way to upgrade, and had gold take on the transient nature of XP along with it.This change paved way to one of our most iconic ideas.  The old XP system provided that rogue-like idea of consequence, because every time you died you lost all your XP.  We could not do that for gold because it was tied to your upgrades, so we had to come up with something else.  And that ultimately led to the creation of Charon.  Rather than remove your gold on death, we forced you to spend it before re-entering the castle.As a final note, I hated the fact that we cut the XP system. Not because I liked it, but because we added it, and I should of had the foresight to see that it wouldn’t mesh well. I didn’t think it through long enough, and that led to a bunch of wasted development time that could have been avoided.XP was another system (like talents) that got cut out entirely. No work that went into the XP system was ever retrofitted into other portions of the game. Consequences like that are solely the blame of the designer, so to all you aspiring game creators, make sure you take every idea you pitch very seriously.This is a short one.Just notes on general balance problems. I knew starting out we wanted a game which encouraged:Skill >>>>> Grind.But we still wanted people who weren’t very good at the game to complete it, so grinding had to be a feasible option.  This paper just has general concepts on how to set scaling of player damage, health etc. to make it not feel critical in the short run, but have it play a big impact in the long.® All Rights Reserved Cellar Door Games 2018® All Rights Reserved Cellar Door Games 2018",

      "The internet is buzzing with excitement for the indie title ‘Rogue Legacy‘ after recently being approved by Steam’s ‘Greenlight’. With over 100,00 YouTube views and thousands of gamers backing the project on the social bookmarking site Reddit, the game has definitely caught our attention.The games graphics is reminiscent of the classic ‘Ghosts and Goblins‘ but it adopts a ‘rogue-like’ game-play mechanic, meaning every game is different. Mix that with a selection of humorous children with such ailments as color blindness and irritable bowel syndrome, and you have all the ingredients of a fantastic gameI managed to drag the Lee brothers away from their final tweaks and test to ask them a few questions about their latest title, the journey and game development in general.Hey, my name’s Teddy Lee, and I’ve been making games with my brother Kenny on and off for about 5 years now?But before working with my brother, I’ve been making games on the side since I was probably around 6, first working with Pen and Paper, and then going up to RPGMaker and other things. Left on my own, I’d probably still be making games with RPG Maker since I can’t code or draw for my life.I don’t remember a time when I didn’t want to get into games, so it’s hard to say.  But there are a few developers that I look up to. Shigeru Miyamoto for sure because he’s constantly on the creative forefront. Pikmin, Zelda, Mario, Nintendogs. All of those games are completely different from one another, and they all spawned their own franchises and genres.Kenny wrote the game entirely in C#, using XNA. It’s a custom engine, so he did a massive amount of work for this game. The largest by a fair margin.The game sort of came together in pieces. We had the general idea for a children mechanic, but we tied everything together in a pretty fluid fashion.  It’s pretty exciting, working on a game for a year, hitting a block, and then trying to design your way out of it. Not really.  It’s pretty horrifying, and definitely leads to nightmares, but that’s how we roll I guess.1.5 years.  My brother worked on it full time, and I worked on it part time up until about 3 months ago. We’ve also hired artists and musicians down the way.Glauber Kotaki is our amazing Pixel Artist.Gordon McGladdery is our musician and sound technician. He makes some amazing stuff.Judson “Tettix” Cowan is another musician on the game, and we’ve worked with him on our other projects. He is always top tops.The children are randomly generated, you get to pick from 3 every time you die, so there’s no real limit.  I guess there’s a theoretical limit but I don’t know the math.Children are composed of 3 major modifiers.CLASS – Each child has their class preference, so you could be like a Knight, or an Assassin, or a Mage, etc. All classes have base modifiers applied to them, as well as their own custom “special ability”.  So a knight can block with his shield, and he has very strong base stats.  An assassin has low health, but a really high critical chance, and he can become smoke, allowing him to walk through enemies.SPELL – Each child has their own preferred spell, so you don’t go into a game with your choosing. And there’s a bunch of spells, and certain spells are locked to certain classes.TRAITS – A child can have upwards of 2 traits. So you could be both nearsighted and color blind which would be brutal.  Or you could be Endomorphic (fat so you don’t get knocked back far), and Gigantic, making you this immovable giant.All of these are applied onto a child, making every play through unique.We just come up with them as we go along.  Some of them we come up accidentally due to a bug in the game, which we then polish off into a feature.The games not made of levels. When you enter the castle the castle is always different, so it’s not like you beat the castle, and then level 2 starts.  There’s defined zones and bosses, but we don’t want to say how many just yet.Just getting the game to where it is now has been quite the challenge. There is so much in the background running in this game that’s easy to take for granted. For example, there’s a dynamic scaling system, which works into the Procedural Map Generation.  There’s a drop system, a chest system, economy links, and this whole slew of other stuff, which all tie into the Procedural Map, with their own rule sets and what not.  We put a lot of time into making the game as “fair” as possible. If we just let the game build itself without any checks and balances, it’d be all over the place.Every time you die, your castle is rebuilt from the ground up. Each room spawns their own set of enemies based off a logic system, they scale dynamically to the castle, and on top of that, bonus rooms and room linking is all applied dynamically to this system as well. We do have some “special” logic rules built into the game world which will help people recognize patterns in the randomness, but they were all implemented purposefully.Never make a game PURE random. PURE random is bad design. Controlled randomization is very important.\nAlso, never mistake procedural as an easy way out. It’s a lot more work then expected.There’s some feelers, but nothing confirmed yet.Well, either a new game, or bankruptcy. We’ve made this game with our own money so if it doesn’t do well, we’re pretty much screwed…But we do have plans in the future if we can sustain ourselves. A couple of projects that we had stopped previously for budget reasons and such.Also, hopefully we get an Oculus Rift.  We’ve been waiting forever for our kit. And we had some really cool things we wanted to try out on that.Make a small game and finish your small game. There’s a huge difference between almost finishing something and actually finishing it.\nAlso, don’t try to do something “better” than someone else.  Be original.  Otherwise it’s just a quality battle, and there will always be teams bigger than you.No idea. We are so thankful to the Reddit community for picking it up the way they have.\nWe do plan on releasing a HD version of the trailer someday.  It looks way better running at 60fps then it does at 30 (YouTube cap).Rhianna Pratchett is currently one of the most revered writers in video games.

      "I had first heard of Rogue Legacy through a recommendation from a follower on Twitter, who told me it was the type of game I might like. Apparently, my Twitter followers know me really, really well. Rogue Legacy is a game that is brimming with fresh ideas that invigorate the 2D action adventure genre and provide gamers with one of the most rewarding gaming experiences of 2013.Rogue Legacy Platforms: PC Developer: Cellar Door Games Publisher: Cellar Door Games Released: June 27, 2013 MSRP: $14.99Rogue Legacy, developed by Cellar Door Games, is billed as a “Rogue-lite,” a play on the roguelike genre that typically consists of games that have randomly generated levels, permadeath, and brutal difficulty.While Rogue Legacy does have randomly generated level layouts and can definitely be considered brutally difficult, the main aspect that sets it apart from other games in this genre is its unique approach to death, which I’ll get to in a little bit. First, let’s just talk about the overall structure of Rogue Legacy.When you begin the game, you enter a large castle made up of randomly generated rooms and enemies. Picture Castlevania mixed with Spelunky and you’ll get a good idea of what Rogue Legacy is all about. Like Castlevania, you move from room to room, clearing enemies and collecting loot as you explore deeper, though there are no areas locked off that require abilities you obtain later on. Every room of the castle can be explored from the start. Whether you’ll want to explore rooms way outside of your level range, though, is another issue. Hint: You won’t.The castle itself is divided into four areas. The base level is the starting point: to the north is the tower, to the east is the forest, and to the south is the dungeon. As mentioned before, you can head to any of the areas right from the start of the game, but there is definitely a recommended order in which to tackle them.Each of the four areas of the castle is guarded by a boss, and only by defeating all four bosses will the door to the final boss open. On paper, this seems like pretty standard procedure for a 2D sidescrolling action/adventure game, right? Well, crumple up that paper, because here is where things get interesting.When you die in Rogue Legacy — and you will die — all of your progress in that particular castle is lost. You’ll be brought back to the title screen and asked to begin your journey again. Only this time, you’ll be able to choose between three heirs to your legacy. Each of the three characters will have their own randomly generated classes, traits and special ability. It’s up to you to take all of that into consideration and select an heir that is best suited to whatever it is you’re trying to accomplish in your next run.The starting classes include a knight, a sorcerer, a barbarian and a knave. Knights are a good all-around class with decent stats across the board, sorcerers are glass cannons that focus on magical spells, knaves have weak stats but great critical hits, and barbarians have low strength/magic but a ton of health. There are more specialized classes that can be unlocked later, and while some are more useful than others, each has its own specific role that they fill.Traits are a little more interesting. These range from the useful, like “ADHD,” which allows you to run faster; to the detrimental, like “Ambilevous,” which causes you to throw your spells backwards; to the straight up strange, like “Vertigo,” which forces you to play the entire game upside down. There are a ton of these traits and you’ll want to try them all, even if they do end up leading you to your death at times.Fortunately, not everything is lost upon death. Your gold carries over to your next of kin, and you can use it to purchase permanent stat upgrades, open up NPC shops, buy new classes, upgrade existing classes, enhance your abilities, and much more. Each time you buy a new upgrade, more upgrades become available, leading to some tough decisions of whether you want to buff your character now, or purchase upgrades that might not be as helpful, but will unlock newer and better upgrades for the future.Once the shops are unlocked, you can also purchase new equipment, abilities, or passive buffs after first finding the corresponding blueprints or runes. The decisions that you make while shopping are critical because once you decide to head back into the castle, you must forfeit the remainder of your gold. You won’t be able to simply stockpile gold and wait until you’re able to afford the big upgrades.And you’re going to need these upgrades because Rogue Legacy can be insanely hard for the unprepared. Entering a wide-open room full of enemies feels like opening the doors to a bullet hell shooter as you’re blinded by a storm of colored dots to avoid. Fortunately, the game’s controls are simple, precise, and more than up to the task of enabling some pretty narrow escapes, especially once you have your full range of movement abilities. Just make sure to play it with a controller.One ingenious addition that will surely prevent unnecessary frustration is the architect. The architect is an NPC that you can purchase once you’re a good portion into the game, and for the price of 70 percent of the gold that you collect during your next run, he can keep the same castle layout as the previous run. So for example, let’s say after much hardship, I finally made it to the boss of the forest. But because of my low health, I don’t stand much of a chance and die. In my next run, if I use the architect, I can lock the previous castle layout in place, use a teleporter to get right back to the boss, and try again with a character at full life. The trade-off here is that the boss will drop substantially less gold, so it becomes a question of whether to take the risk and try to get to the boss on your own, or give up a chunk of your reward and get a free extra shot against the boss with a healthy character.This feature pretty much single-handedly saves Rogue Legacy from ever becoming too frustrating, and I can’t stress enough its importance for those who are having trouble with one of the game’s extremely tough boss battles.Rogue Legacy is a game that is full of interesting ideas, and the rare thing is, they all work. Sure, the random nature of the game can lead to some frustration when your three potential characters each have a crappy trait, but part of what makes Rogue Legacy fun is trying to make the best out of a poor situation. There’s a certain unique satisfaction you get when you perform better than you thought you would with a character you had low expectations for, based on his or her class and traits.It’s not for everyone, and I’d hesitate to recommend Rogue Legacy to those who get discouraged and frustrated easily. But for those who are looking for a challenge, Rogue Legacy is a must-play and a steal at its $15 price tag.Pros:Cons:Final Score: 90/100Game Front employs a 100-point scale when reviewing games to be as accurate about the experience as possible.

      "JiG is on Patreon and Needs You! Click here for more informationOn the surface, Cellar Door Games' indie action roguelike game Rogue Legacy is simple. You control a hero trying to navigate a deadly, ever-changing castle with the [arrow] keys, jumping with [S] and slashing with [D], and try not to die. But the twist isn't that you will die, although that's definitely a certainty. The twist is that when you do, you'll be able to keep playing as the child of that hero in an effort to best the castle for good... and those children might be born with a variety of real life conditions. Color blindness, dwarfism, even irritable bowel syndrome are just the tip of the iceberg. Some do nothing other than change the way you view the world, while others may have a big impact on how you play. But who decides what's a disadvantage anyway, and who says anyone can't be a hero?The majority of your time will be spent adventuring through the castle, trying to uncover its secrets and get past its many bosses. Once you die, that's that, and you'll be given the opportunity to pick from one of three potential heirs to resume playing... though the castle's interior will be completely different. Initially, you can expect to die. A lot. But as you gather coins, you can begin expanding your manor in a variety of ways to help you. You can pay for upgrades to strength and class abilities, or even entirely new classes, and new characters like the blacksmith or architect, whose abilities can make you even stronger.Naturally, paying for all this beneficial interior decorating is expensive. As a result, you can expect to do a lot of grinding, which here means dying a whole bunch since you can only spend gold after you're dead (who says you can't take it with you?) and any gold your new heir tries to carry back into the castle will be confiscated by its ghostly gatekeeper.Analysis: With its demand for reflexes and sadistic room design, Rogue Legacy isn't the game for people who like their roguelikes slow and turnbased. You're going to die a lot, and that sort of forced failure before glory won't sit well with everyone. Luckily, the castle's ever-changing interior means you'll rarely feel like you're trudging back through the same thing twice, and the simple control scheme is something anyone can pick up... though mastering it is a different matter. Though the game will allow you to customise your keys, it won't allow you to use any controller other than an Xbox one, which is a bit of a bummer. Almost as big of a bummer as those frustrating pads that have to be opened with a downward sword-strike in midair that are often used as platforms.It's a game that demands a lot from you, and the myriad of enemies, obstacles, and traps crammed in most rooms feels punishing to say the least. Recovery items are hard to come by, and you'll need to do a lot of grinding to beef up your characters to be able to handle most of what the game throws at them. Certain character traits can also dramatically change how you play. It could be as simple as the charming sepia-toned hue the nostalgia trait paints everything, but it could also be the frustratingly large target having Gigantism turns you into. Oh, and don't think you can just avoid choosing any differently-abled heirs, since before long everyone has something, and speaking of which...Ultimately, Rogue Legacy's approach to genetic differences is going to be something you'll have to make up your own mind how to feel about, and different life experiences and perspectives means everyone has the right to feel their own way. In a lot of ways, however, its inclusion of characters like this feels important, since how often do \"disabled\" people ever feature in games at all, much less in the starring role? How do you decide what's more insensitive... implementing a disability in a game, or ignoring that they exist altogether? The screenshot here, for example, is not a mistake but what happens when you get a character who suffers from vertigo. Is that offensive? What about when the game mimics the same near-sightedness I suffer from by making everything around your character nauseatingly blurry?That, of course, is purely a matter of personal choice and opinion. As far as its gameplay goes, however, Rogue Legacy is at the same time both exceedingly difficult in the way that makes me wonder if I insulted the developer in a former life, and yet also exceedingly addicting. It's filled with surprises and challenges that will keep you coming back for more no matter how hard it knocks you down. It looks beautiful too, with detailed and vibrant pixel art that changes in new and unexpected ways depending on who you're playing as, and the whole presentation, gameplay included, makes me feel like I'm playing something from the SNES-era... with teeth. Though certain aspects of it are bound to be polarising, any action fan with a fondness for challenge will still want to make a date with the demo at the very least. Rogue Legacy is brutal, but clever, and however you feel they handled the inclusion of everything from physical disabilities to tongue-in-cheek sexuality, I'd hope we can all agree that inclusion in general for players of all types is something we could use a bit more of from games in the future.Windows:\nDownload the demo\nOrder the full version (via GOG)Mac OS X:\nNot available.Try Boot Camp or Parallels or CrossOver Games.^ Scroll Up | Homepage >Good review :)\nI got addicted to the demo a few weeks ago, bought everything I could, maximized everything etc. I still haven't bought the full version yet though.I just bought this game, and I must say I'm fairly disappointed. The game is not so much difficult as it is tedious. My biggest beef is your ability to attack: it is insanely hard to hit something above or below you. Likewise, turning to strike something immediately behind you causes you to turn into the enemy and take damage. Maybe half of the damage I take is from moving (or dodging) into an enemy I can't hit.All this game has really successfully done is make me appreciate certain aspects of other games.Sorry, Brian. Maybe you should have checked out the demo first to make sure it was your taste. :) Personally, I feel the classic approach to gameplay mechanics is the whole point of it, and spells and knowing when to duck and run meant I could handle enemies from any angle.@BrianZuro, The game is supposed to be unfair. It's a throwback to the classic rpgs and adventures.UpdateLeave a comment [top of page]All games mentioned or hosted and images appearing on JayIsGames are Copyright their respective owner(s).All other content is Copyright ©2003-2018 JayIsGames.com.

      "Indie game news, reviews, previews & developer interviewsadvertisementRogue Legacy from Toronto indie developer Cellar Door Games is a ‘Metroidvania’ side-scrolling action platformer that also bills itself as a ‘Rogue Lite’. Note: that’s “Lite”, not “Like”. Still, a Rogue-Like is clearly the intended pun there, as when you die, your present character is permanently dead, only to be replaced by the offspring of your now-deceased hero, hence the game’s title is based around the idea that each new character is continuing the legacy of the previous one. Rogue Lite, Rogue Legacy, get it?Unlike your standard roguelikes, you will eventually need to get yourself killed to advance in the game. When you die, starting over with a new progeny is not the only thing that happens: All of the loot you collected in that run may then be spent on permanent stat upgrades or on equipment that give big boosts to attack power, defenses, and special traits. While at first glance, this is a great way to slowly advance your power, a good player will sometimes be forced to kill himself just so they can advance further with a more powerful character.Thankfully, every run though the castle is mostly unique, as the layouts of the rooms are randomized every time. Treasure, traps, and monster placements will always be new and fresh, though sometimes you’ll come across treasure rooms where you have no hope of claiming their spoils if you do not have a very specific character class with special abilities. There is a way past this though: if you so choose, you can lock the layout of the castle into a repeat of your most recent run. You can then plan abilities to equip and character classes to pick if there was a treasure room you wanted to get that you were unable to claim earlier.As for the difficulty level, let’s be clear: This game is tough. At many points throughout the game, it will defy your attempts at categorization. The gameplay can range from that of an action RPG platformer to that of an all-out Bullet Hell shmup; enemies can quickly fill the screen with projectiles or even with themselves and their buddies. when they hit, they hit hard.Health is recovered slowly and only reliably if you ‘itemize’ around it, but while challenging, it’s survivable; monsters will always have tells betraying their incoming attacks.Just about everything is avoidable if you play your cards right… That is if you are not afflicted with Endomorphism.The last little distinguishing quirk comprises the abilities or drawbacks bestowed upon your character’s heir. Every new character has one or two traits, be they flaws or assets, or just quirky oddities. You could play as a knight with near-sightedness, tunnel-vision, baldness, Tourettes, colorblindness, vertigo. You can even be homosexual; while most things effect gameplay slightly in some way, others are just for fun.A few examples: Vertigo flips the world upside-down, forcing the player to compensate. Color-blindness makes everything grayscale. Balding characters cause the Loading screen to display ‘Balding’ instead. My personal favorite was being flatulent – it’s juvenile, for certain, but the occasional fart sound while jumping just gave me the giggles.Scatological amusements aside – assets-wise (oh geez, no pun intended), I felt Rogue Legacy could do with a little more variety in the music department, but what is there, is still solid and entertaining.The art design – on the other hand – is superb; every sprite is beautifully and effectively animated, which helps to identify imminent threats in attack sequences, particularly when things get hectic. Nothing appears to be out of place, and every aspect seems to gel within its own environment. The altered visual effects used to display the shortcomings of impaired characters is well-implemented and adds a bit of flavor and risk to a character choice. Just as you encounter a class you like, you may find it comes laden with not-so-great character traits.Getting though the game, even with its high difficulty, will not be the ultimate end. There is ye olde New Game Plus to await you in further adventures. Then after that, New Game Plus Plus, etc. So even with only 4 areas and 5 bosses – much of which you will have to traverse many, many times before completing even a single full game – the amount of potential challenge is quite satisfactory.Rogue Legacy takes some interesting chances and pays off with an intriguing new spin on a mashup of genres and play-styles.Rating:advertisementView previous campaigns.Powered by MailChimpadvertisementLast Post:Next Post:This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

      "We recently looked at a couple of upcoming 2D Xbox One games that have plenty of potential: ' The Escapists' and 'Adventures of Pip.' The former is a distinctive sandbox game set within a series of prisons, whereas the latter is a traditional action platformer with some light puzzles and a great art style. Both games will likely turn out very well. But the 2D game that I'm most excited to see coming to Xbox One is Rogue Legacy from Toronto-based indie developer Cellar Door Games.Rogue Legacy is an action-platformer with lots of exploration, not unlike my fellow favorites Guacamelee and Strider. The twist is the castle you're sent to explore changes every time you die, at which point you'll return as the descendant of the previous character – complete with new traits and powers.Rogue Legacy builds on classic games like Castlevania and creates something very different and special. The Xbox One version doesn't have a release date yet, so let our detailed preview tide you over in the meantime.The goal in Rogue Legacy is to fully explore a massive castle and defeat all five of the gigantic boss monsters inside. The platforming and exploration work a lot like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, with your character able to attack, jump, and cast spells to start with. But surviving the castle's perils is truly challenging, with hordes of dangerous enemies and obstacles filling practically every room. Health-replenishing food doesn't drop frequently, so your knight is bound to die eventually.When that happens, you'll take over as the child of that fallen hero. Players can initially select from three potential descendants, each with different classes, traits, and spells. And I do mean different – the list of potential traits is enormous, many affecting gameplay is humorous or challenging ways. Your new hero might move faster thanks to ADHD, suffer from nearsightedness that makes distant objects blurry, suffer from a fear of chickens (which makes food act like an enemy!), and much more.The castle layout shifts every time one of your heroic descendants enters it, adding even more variety and replayability. Progress would be difficult, if not for the permanent upgrades you can buy between lives. Spending the coins your fallen hero has collected on manor upgrades will allow you to permanently increase family stats, unlock new classes, and more. You can also discover equipment that boosts stats and runes that add abilities like double jumping, all of which will help your family of adventurers to make it farther and farther into the dark castle.Rogue Legacy was originally developed by a small team of eight for a paltry sum of $15,000. After launching on Steam in 2013, it became an immediate success. The next year, Cellar Door Games ported the game to Playstation 3, 4, and Vita. Yes, the Playstation crowd has been enjoying one of the finest indie games around since last year.Thankfully, Rogue Legacy will arrive on Xbox One later this year. We'll do our best to dig up some additional details on the Xbox One version in the months to come. If you can't wait till then and you're not a Playstation gamer, check out the Steam version. When paired with an Xbox 360 controller, it offers an extremely engrossing platforming experience.Big thanks to Koop for originally introducing me to Rogue Legacy!",
      "Type to SearchRelease Date: June 27Platforms available on: PCDeveloper: Cellar Door GamesPublisher: Cellar Door GamesGenre: Action platforming roguelikeA young knight, sword held gleefully aloft in front of him, enters a foreboding castle intent on avenging the deaths of his ancestors.He slashes through animated skeletons, floating eyeballs and harmless chandeliers for a few rooms, before an evil painting suddenly pops off the wall, and devours him whole. Game over.This is Rogue Legacy, a game paying homage to the 'roguelike' dungeon crawling genre with a more hereditary focus.Unlike other games that fall under the 'rogue' classification, Rogue Legacy eschews the overhead dungeon perspective for a side-scrolling view that gives a feeling more reminiscent of Ghouls 'n Ghosts or the early Castlevania games.The shift in perspective may give a more accessible appearance, but it can't hide the punishing difficulty that has long been the root of the genre.Players will die frequently and without mercy in Rogue Legacy, but the team at Cellar Door Games has found a creative way to twist the genre to turn each painful death into an exciting and fun opportunity.Whenever a hero dies, players must choose one of his or her offspring to take up the sword as the next generation's hero. This is where the legacy in the game's title comes from.Every generation you are given three new offspring to choose from, each of which has a randomized class and a small handful of randomly assigned traits.Classes are balanced well to give each a unique play style. Knights have stronger attacks while barbarians have more health and wizards have more powerful spells.Eventually more unique classes also open up, like the miner who can gather more gold and the lich whose maximum health grows with every kill.You can later upgrade classes to make them even more distinct, like turning the knight into a paladin with a shield, or giving the miner a head lamp to highlight all treasure chests in the castle.And while picking the right class is important, it's the character traits that push Rogue Legacy over the edge from being merely a fun dungeon crawler into becoming an addiction.Traits come in all varieties, and offer a range of unique effects. Some, like baldness and irritable bowel syndrome, are purely cosmetic attributes to add some extra personality to your heroes (the latter of which causes your hero to cheerfully toot their way through the castle when jumping or hit by an enemy).Others are more eccentric, like color-blindness and nostalgia, which cover the screen in black and white or sepia filters respectively.Vertigo is particularly devious, flipping the entire screen upside down. Meanwhile dementia is a personal favorite, causing your hero to occasionally hallucinate enemies that cannot be killed but likewise cannot hurt you either.Most of the traits will have a more profound impact on your play style, though. Gigantism and dwarfism will make you bigger or smaller, impacting your sword's reach and opening some secret passage ways for smaller characters.Traits can also alter how far your character is knocked back when hit by an enemy or even make your hero invulnerable to the spike traps that litter the castle.Heroes are assigned up to two traits, and you'll often find yourself picking new heroes based on traits rather than classes for the unique variations they add to the typical castle exploration.The castle itself is also randomised each generation, with room layouts and enemy placements shifting for each new hero.Early on this fact is immensely frustrating. Your early heroes will likely die only a few rooms into the castle, making it difficult to feel like any progress is being made.But you quickly learn that progress is measured in gold collected, rather than rooms explored. By amassing gold you can use your fallen hero's treasure to build a castle of your own, unlocking new classes and adding permanent stat boosts to future generations.Your heroes will get stronger as your castle grows, and in turn you will be able to venture further into the perpetually shifting dungeon.A haunted forest, a trap-filled tower and a hellish underworld offer new enemies, challenges and bosses to discover, and will take many generations before you are ready to face them.The castle is also rife with secrets to uncover as you explore. Magic runes are hidden in chests unlocked by special criteria, like clearing all enemies in a room or crossing a chasm of spikes without taking damageBlueprints can be found for new weapons and armor. Powerful mini-bosses will reward you with more treasure, and there is even a sad clown running a carnival who will let you shoot at targets to earn some extra gold.The cornerstone holding all of the random elements in check is the game's focus on collecting gold rather than simply killing enemies.The gold, and the permanent upgrades it can buy, become a constant variable amid a sea of chaos.The quest for gold also pushes players to explore new and harder areas, as the upgrades become more expensive, requiring you to seek out stronger enemies and the rewards that come with them.The gold that acts as a balance can also become a barrier though. It is possible to reach the point of diminishing rewards, where new areas may prove to be more challenging than you can handle but the well-traveled rooms don't offer enough gold to afford new upgrades.It's a difficult hump to overcome if you hit it, bringing the game's pace to a screeching halt until you spawn a hero with a lucky enough combination of class and traits to proceed.There are also a few purely technical hiccups, where the game crashes without warning while trying to restart after dying.An update shortly after launch has admittedly made crashes less frequent, but has not eliminated them completely.Rogue Legacy's beauty lies in never knowing quite what to expect when your new far-sighted and flatulent hero enters the castleAt first the randomness feels like it hampers discovery, since you are constantly faced with losing your progress.But before long it is clear that the game's chaotic nature actually enhances the exploration, with each generation presenting an entire castle of new discoveries.Each hero's death means an opportunity to buy new castle upgrades, but in order to enter the castle upgrade screen you have to first select the next generation's hero.Once the upgrades are selected, you already have a new hero so you might as well explore the newly randomised castle, and the whole cycle starts over again.It becomes difficult to tear yourself away from Rogue Legacy, as the repetitive flow is brilliantly augmented by randomly generated traits and dungeon layouts.Before you know it, three hours and 20 generations of heroes have passed, and you finally realize that your cheeks are where you feel the strain the most from smiling the entire time.PREVIOUS ARTICLENEXT ARTICLEDIGITAL SPY, PART OF THE HEARST UK ENTERTAINMENT NETWORK\n\n© 2018 Hearst Magazines UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 72 Broadwick Street, London, W1F 9EP.

      "Risk of Rain is a platform video game incorporating both Metroidvania and roguelike elements, developed by a two-student team from the University of Washington under the name Hopoo Games. The game, initially a student project, was funded through a Kickstarter campaign to improve the title, and was published by Chucklefish to Microsoft Windows in November 2013. OS X and Linux versions premiered as part of a Humble Bundle in October 28, 2014. Ports for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, developed with assistance from Code Mystics, were released on April 12, 2016.\nThe player controls the survivor of a space freighter crash on a strange planet. As the player progresses through levels, selected randomly and with some procedural placement of objects within the level, they attempt to survive by killing monsters and collecting items that can boost their offensive and defensive abilities. The game features a difficulty scale that increases with time, requiring the player to choose between spending time building experience and completing levels quickly before the monsters become more difficult. By discovering various hidden locations, players can discover artifacts which can alter gameplay. The game supports up to four cooperative players in online play and up to two players in local play.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nAt the start of the game, each player selects one of twelve characters. Initially, only one character is available, Commando,  but as the player completes various in-game objectives, more characters become available. Each character has various statistics and a set of unique moves; for example, the sniper has the ability to hit creatures from a long distance for large, piercing damage but their firing rate is slow, while the commando can do rapid, moderate damage at close range.\nWithin all but the last level of the game, the goal is to locate a teleporter, placed in a random location. As the players hunt for it, they will encounter monsters; upon death, the monsters will drop in-game money and will also provide the players experience. As the players gain experience they will increase the player level, gaining more hit points and stronger attacks. Money can be used to open various chests, buy items at stores, activate attack drones that aid in combat, or pray at shrines that have a random chance of dropping items, described by game lore as the space freighter's cargo. There are over 110 items in the game, and these provide benefits such as passive bonuses that improve offensive or defensive capabilities, or a special usable with a cooldown. Players can only hold one useable at any time, but they can collect many passive items, including multiple versions of the same item, stacking the benefits of these items. The location of these items is randomly determined through roguelike procedural generation.\nOnce the players have found the teleporter, they activate it, starting a 90-second countdown on Drizzle (easy) and Rainstorm (medium) difficulty and a 120-second one on Monsoon (hard) and the players have to survive. During this time, many more monsters, including at least one boss character (if the Kin artifact is not active), will appear. After the countdown is over, no new monsters will appear but the players will have to defeat all remaining monsters before they can use the teleporter and proceed to the next level. At this time, any remaining money the players have is converted to experience points. At the penultimate level, the players have the option of taking the teleporter to the final level (the crashed ship), or to use the teleporter to run through much higher difficulties of previous levels so as to gain more experience and items; when this latter option is taken, the teleporter on these levels will allow the same choice to either proceed to the final level or continue through additional levels. On the final level, the player must fight a final boss character; if they survive, they are able to escape the planet and win the game.\nThe difficulty of the game is determined by a timer. The difficulty level increases every 5 minutes up through 10 levels, with newly spawned monsters having more health and stronger attacks. Additionally, boss characters may spawn before the players have found teleporters on higher difficulties. If playing alone, the game is over when the player dies. In multiplayer mode, a player that dies must wait until the other players survive to the next level, upon which they are brought back into play.\nThe item drops are based on the various progress the player has made in the meta-game through repeated playthroughs. For example, defeating certain boss characters for the first time will unlock an item that can then drop in future playthroughs. Other items are based on completing certain goals, such as winning the game a number of times, or performing specific goals with each of the characters. In Rainstorm or Monsoon modes, monsters will also rarely drop log books that describe the monsters; this itself is used to unlock more items and a playable character.\nThe last level, Providence is the boss and once he is beaten, the character of Sniper is unlocked and Mercenary can be unlocked if Providence is killed 4 times.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nRisk of Rain was developed by two students at the University of Washington, Duncan Drummond and Paul Morse, later releasing the game under the name Hopoo Games. The two took inspiration from their favorite games in the past and combined them into a single package, focusing primarily on the platformer and roguelike genres. They also wanted to add the idea of a game that scales in difficulty that \"puts the player in a sense of urgency and makes them make tough choices often\". Risk of Rain was developed using the GameMaker: Studio tool. The title Risk of Rain was selected not only to allow the game to be easily searchable via the Internet, but came to allude to the concept of a single protagonist in the large game world always worried about \"a risk of failure or bad things happening\".The original idea Drummond and Morse had for their game, which they started developing as sophomores, was a tower defense where the difficulty of the attacking creatures would rise with the distance that they were from the defense point, but they found that players would opt to avoid venturing from that point. They sought to find a means to force the player to keep moving and came to the idea of \"difficulty = time\" concept. Though this is implemented so that it appears that the difficulty increases every five minutes to the player, internally, a difficulty counter is incremented every minute as to create an apparently smoother transition to the player. This counter translates into a semi-exponential growth in newly-created enemies' attack strength, a semi-logarithmic growth in these enemies' health points, and a logarithmic growth in the rate that the player's health increases with character level. Drummond and Morse found this created favorable gameplay that created moments of \"highs and lows\" and keep the player on edge, having times where the player may feel overpowered to the enemies and moments later find themselves in a struggle to stay alive. Another mechanic they had explored with the \"difficulty = time\" approach was to incorporate the speed at which the player defeated enemies into the difficulty counter, but found this removed the \"highs and lows\" in the game.Another element of the difficulty approach was the rate which enemies are generated. The game uses an artificial intelligence (AI) system that \"buys\" enemies to spawn at random intervals using a point system; this AI is given points at a rate that scales with the difficulty counter. Enemies have point values, with more difficult enemies costing more points, and the AI will buy as many as it can. Due to limitations with GameMaker, Drummond and Morse found that having too many enemies spawn in stressed the game, so created a means for the AI to buy an \"elite\" enemy if it were to otherwise buy five of a single type; these elite enemies have additional attributes, such as higher attack values, and present a harder challenge to kill. They found this workaround created extra dynamism for the game, which Drummond called as \"a merge of game functionality and game design\". Risk of Rain was tested primarily to balance the difficulty system, and Drummon and Morse were aware that with all the available items to collect in the game, it is possible to \"break the game\" by acquiring specific combinations of item drops which would make the player overpowered or invincible. They believe this was still acceptable since this was highly tied to the game's random generator.The game is presented in 8-bit-like two-dimensional graphics. This economy of graphics allowed them to both develop sprites for new enemies easily, but also allowed them to give a sense of scale to the larger bosses compared to the player's character. Character designs were made to provide enough differences between classes, and to give abilities that relied on the player's skill to give the player satisfaction of playing well, such as introducing a damage boost on the sniper's gun if the player times their reload appropriately.After completing most of the core game on their college budgets, the Hopoo Games team turned to Kickstarter to gain additional funds to update the game to the latest version of GameMaker, obtain a musician to provide music for the game, and additional quality control. The Kickstarter was launched in April 2013 seeking $7,000, and ended up with more than $30,000 in backers. This allowed them to get Chris Christodoulou to compose the game's soundtrack and add several additional gameplay features to the title. The success of the Kickstarter led to a publishing partnership with Chucklefish, providing them server space and forums for the game's players. They would later gain help of Matthew Griffin, from Yeti Trunk, another developer that has worked with Chucklefish, to help improve the game's multiplayer code.The Hopoo team announced in February 2014 that they were working with Sony Computer Entertainment America to bring the game to the PlayStation Vita. With assistance from Code Mystics, Hopoo announced that the game will also come to the PlayStation 4 alongside the Vita version; these versions will support an online matchmaking system and the ability for two local players to join with other online players. The PlayStation versions also support cross-platform play, enabling both PlayStation 4 and Vita players to play together.\n\n\n=== Sequel ===\nIn May 2017, Hopoo Games announced that they had been working on a sequel Risk of Rain 2 over the previous 6 months. The game is expected to maintain the same core loop as the first game. While the game was still at the early stage of development and other features might change, Hopoo affirmed that they were transitioning the game from 2D to 3D, as the 3D option provided \"much deeper design spaces and more possibilities for cool gameplay\" as well as more ways to artistically express themselves. When they started development on the sequel, Hopoo started with a 2D-based prototype with the player in control of one of the monsters in the first game, as to mix up the formula for the sequel. Part of the addition for this was inspired by Risk of Rain fan art that showed the various objects the player collected shown on the character, and Hopoo wanted to use this approach for the sequel, but the 2D graphic approach did not give them enough visual space to work with. They transitioned the prototype from 2D to 2.5D, representing the character in 3D graphics but otherwise playing as a 2D platformer, but when they completed that, they felt it was better to move the game fully to 3D, with the transition being relatively quick to complete. The sequel will use the Unity engine, which Hopoo had to learn for this, as well as the time in developing the 3D worlds.The sequel will bring back most of the same classes of characters and monsters from the first game, but with modified or new abilities reflecting differences between 2D and 3D. Hopoo explained that some monsters that were difficult to avoid in the original game due to their size could easily be kited around with the added space of 3D, so they added additional attacks for these monsters to make them more difficult. The 3D maps are anticipated to be large-enough worlds with random placement of the end-goal teleporter and items such that they do not expect to have to add in level permutations as the first game had used, since the large maps will provide enough variety that players will not likely experience the complete level in one playthrough. Hopoo plans to improve the multiplayer options, including using Steam peer-to-peer connectivity, matchmaking including private matches, and split-screen play.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn February 2015, Hopoo Games partnered with IndieBox, a monthly subscription box service, to offer a physical release of Risk of Rain. This limited, individually-numbered, collector’s edition included a flash-drive with a DRM-free game file, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual, Steam key, and various custom-designed collectible items.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRisk of Rain was named one of the Student Showcase winners of the 2014 Independent Games Festival, and subsequently won the Student Prize Award.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
      "Paul MorseHey there! I am the lead game designer and PR guy for the Risk of Rain Team. I have a strong passion for games and have always wanted to be part of a small development team. I’ve gained more experience in web development, communication, and how to run a small business from working on Risk of Rain than I even imagined. I am currently at the University of Washington studying Finance and Entrepreneurship. I am very excited to be working on Risk of Rain and seeing what the future of Hopoo Games becomes.Duncan DrummondHey! I am the artist and programmer for Risk of Rain. While this is my first big project, I have been tampering with GameMaker for quite a few years. I’m self-taught in both GameMaker and Pixel Art (done in MS Paint!) Currently I attend the University of Washington, studying Mechanical Engineering. I love video games and my pet cat, Dio.The game began as sketches on the back of scrap paper. As we kept brainstorming, the game we were talking about sounded.. fun! We have been working on Risk of Rain for about 5 months, and the feedback we have received so far is incredible. Having never released any games to the public, it’s exciting to see that we can make something that many people enjoy.Chris ChristodoulouHello folks. I’m writing the music for Risk of Rain which means I’m the one to blame every time you’re looking for the mute button. In my free time I’m selling these fine leather jackets™.",
      "I wouldn’t say low-poly, but more like mid-poly. It’s ~5k a character, and most enemy models use a baked normal map as well.We actually use a modified version of the deferred pipeline (so we can use a lot of point lights on projectiles, effects, etc.) We use one of our gbuffer channels as a reference to a ramp to remap our NdotL values to - so most character’s use a two-tone ramp, but the environment uses a very soft ramp. You can also use a ramp that doesn’t end in black for a fake subsurface effect. The effect is a bit subtle, but it adds a lot in terms of making characters contrast more. Below is an example of the character ramp (center) compared to 2 environment ramps (side). Take note on how the light terminates. Full size.I suspect this is the way BoTW also does their deferred pipeline, because of this bug that someone found.It currently has matchmaking and P2P through Steam - so no hamachi or port forward crap. At some point we want the option for people to host dedicated servers, but we haven’t fully explored that yetIt’s going well - we’re just quiet because we’re working on a couple of new exciting announcements! ~Stay tuned not-so-soonishly~That definitely did (and still does) happen.I think in theory it’d be nice if the director could realize this, but also in some ways it would be a bit demotivating if you did really well and the game “punished” you for it. In some ways, it’s your reward. But it would be nice if there was still a challenge.I think some light touches would be great, we just can’t think of any great calculations that wouldn’t go awry. Things like average monster count might be a decent indicator?Sorry! The updates take a better part of a few hours, plus the tax of switching from development mode to blog mode. A lot of the work we do is also not super flashy. Just know that long times between updates is just because we’re working really hard, and don’t want to get distracted. Here’s a random icon.We don’t really have a selection of characters that we’ve pre planned to be in the game, we sorta just make it up as we go along and see if the kit is interesting in 3D or the character its cool enough we can rework their kitHaving said that, I feel like the merc is the only melee class who can actually have the same kit and still work in 3d, assuming he can dash directionally. The fantasty is obviously for it to become a DmC style character with interrupts and juggles… but that’s probably not feasible with our skill level :xcurrently bosses drop an item for each player alive, and they’re all the same type when droppedThe aimlock is a special ability the Huntress has, along with being able to fire while sprinting - with the drawback that she has much shorter range than most other ranged charactersHiIt has been exactly 1 year (and 1 day) since we announced we were working on Risk of Rain 2.This update isn’t going to be about specific new systems or content, but about the overall cadence of development and what our goals are going forward.Where are we in development?A majority of the time spent in the last year was working on backend systems to better support the full game, and we feel that that is finally coming to completion. We are hoping to focus on content and polish throughout the next year, and prepping the game so it’s presentable to people, not just us internally.New classes, levels, items, monsters, bosses, and of course original ones from Risk of Rain have been added. With the core systems in place we are able to start designing new content that adds new layers on top of the existing loop for RoR1. We want to make sure that there is a lot of fresh new content that adds to the fun, and we are holding ourselves to a higher standard of game design than in our previous games. We are trying our best to make sure there isn’t a lot of filler items or monsters.Beta PlansSince announcing RoR2 we haven’t stopped getting emails or tweets asking about alpha/beta testing and how that is going to work. Because RoR2 is quite a complicated game, we will need to do a lot of testing for networking, progression, balance, and overall game feel.We are getting to a point in development where we are starting to plan out how we want to invite people to start testing RoR2 and help us build a community for the long term. This will most likely start off with a small/private closed alpha that people can sign up for via a website (that doesnt exist yet). We will also launch an official RoR2 discord once that time arrives, so people can talk about the game and give feedback directly.Based on the feedback of the closed alpha we will then plan our next steps depending on what requires more testing and feedback. Things like matchmaking require a large volume of people to properly test. We also have a couple new design directions that we want to hear lots of feedback for.Moving ForwardNow that we have a few games under our belts, we want to make sure Risk of Rain 2 is the best game we can possibly make and sustain. We want to include as many features as possible to build a growing community and continue to update the game into the future. Local co-op, online multiplayer with matchmaking, localization, discord servers and free updates are all things we think will help foster a community, but we would love to hear feedback on how we can keep the game active for the long haul. One of the most important things going forward is community engagement – and we will be opening up avenues for discussion later in development.We’ve posted a RAW JUICY video from one of our playtests, bugs and all, as a milestone of where we are in development. While it’s obviously still a work in progress, it is representative of the direction we are taking the game. Please let us know how you feel - it’s really important that we begin to collect community feedback as early as possible.Overall this has been a \nfantastic \n\nyear of development for us, and I really feel like we’ve begun to make a game that everyone will have a great time playing. I’m sure that we will exceed everyone’s expectations by the time we are done :)thx nerdsblender, but most recommend maya and zbrush",
      "it’s absolutely not going to be canceled and it’s going well - blog post most likely next weekit will have bothnope, not yet! We are hard at work but we’re still quite a ways outok npI tried to answer every question as honestly as\nI could, so I hope this is a good read. If your question isn’t there, it’s\neither identical to another one asked or joined together with another question. Cheers!Q: In total, how much time does the campaign of\nDeadbolt span? It’s hard to tell, what with it being infinite nighttime and\nall.A: I would imagine a month-ish. It is implied\nthat the Candles are doing some sort of investigative work between missions,\nwhich would surely take some time.\nQ: Did you have any major inspirations for the visual design of DEADBOLT? \nA: John Wick is obviously the biggest one!\nQ: What would hopoo do if someone made a game completely based and inspired\nfrom Deadbolt and its… Concept? (with permission and not) \nA: There’s no way DEADBOLT is that unique in settings or thematics –\nultimately, you know what’s right and what’s wrong when you’re inspired by a\nwork, and so will everyone else! If you feel obligated to ask for permission, maybe\nyou’re not exploring enough original ideas? \nQ: When will we get modding? if so could\nwe get a simplified modding kit? Any plans for updating dedbort, even\njust the map editor? Feature for adding custom sprites, rotation tool,\ncopypasta tool, just to name a few… \nA: So the thing with that is that the map editor is only half the equation –\nwhile the map editor may be writing stuff to files, it also has to be\ninterpreted on the end by the DEADBOLT game itself. Therefore, adding features\nthat aren’t supported in engine simply won’t work – it won’t know what youre\ntalking about. While rotation is supported in the engine, it doesn’t know how\nto read that from the files, etc. I also am trying to avoid any legacy issues\nwhere old maps are required for old versions of DEADBOLT, or vice versa.\nQ: When is deadbolt 2 coming with werewolves and mummies \nA: Werewolves aren’t undead you dingus. But mummies could be cool.Q: Will the stuff that came with the release of\nDeadbolt on Play Station, will be added on PC? \nA: Nope, that was sorta our deal-sweetener for getting on the Sony consoles.\nQ: Will we ever see expansion levels for Deadbolt or would we get Deadbolt 2\ninstead? \nA: DEADBOLT 2 maybe sometimeQ: Does Ibzan is gay? \nA: I haven’t really thought of the sexual orientation of any of the characters,\nand I definitely don’t want to pull a JK Rowling and retroactively assign them.\nSo in terms of canon, that just hasn’t been explored.Q: Would you prefer deadbolt 2 to be in 3d and 2d? Would you do a sequel? \nA: DEADBOLT is probably the narrowest design space I’ve worked with – there’s\nno dodging, insta death, insta travel attacks. By the end I felt very stretched\nout in terms of enemy design, and for that alone I’d think 3D. But hey, I may\nalso just hate 3D by the end of RoR2 so who knows :^). I’d love to do a sequel\none day, most likely from the perspective of Ibzan. But who knows!\nQ: Did Ibzan want to kill the Fire, or just try to reconcile with it? \nA: He just wanted to talk – but who knows what would’ve happened after the\nFireplace rejected him?\nQ: Would you be interested in going back to the world of deadbolt sometime in\nthe future? I remember hearing somewhere a 3D concept would be interesting to\nwork on. \nA: I wish I was talented or driven enough to write comics for it – I think\nDEADBOLT is more about the stories of individuals, compared to RoR who is a\nstory of the universe. I wrote the Cassette Tapes to reflect that.\nQ: Looking back, is there anything you’d change about Deadbolt? \nA: Hmmm… I just wish I somehow could expand more on the lore and gangs, and\nwhat their goals were. Gameplay-wise, it was a tad too short. I liked doing a\nfew standard stages, and then a mix-up stage (sniper, trap, boss, etc) – maybe\nwe could’ve fit in a few more rotations.\nQ: What’s your favourite loadout? \nA: Death/Taxes and Flashbang, like a scrub.\nQ: Would you ever be interested in restarting the asset suggestion thread \nA: I consider DEADBOLT to be done – as a 2 (now 3!) man team, we financially\ncan’t do the games-as-a-service thing like most big companies can for smaller\ngames like DEADBOLT. I also intended DEADBOLT to be a one-and-done thing as a\ncontrast for Risk of Rain, which we updated for years after release.=CONTROVERSIAL OPINION ALERT= I personally also\nthink that EVERY game getting a bunch of DLCS and updates and patches for a\nlong time is, in a way, exhausting as a player. I think it makes it hard to\nfeel satisfied when you finished a game and it’s over and you feel completed in\nthe journey, knowing it’s not ~technically~ over until the devs stop patching.\nI think it’s great for some games (mostly multiplayer-based ones), but some\ngames you just gotta let… finish, on a good note. Semi-open ended endings are\nalways unsatisfying, in my opinion, and so recently it just feels like you\ndon’t ever complete a game. …On the\nflip side, we are planning on doing lots of post-launch support for RoR2\nbecause it’s actually inline with our design goals, so don’t fret!\nQ: Will bugs like Scythe not having a\ncover sprite or some enemies not having a falling sprite (which causes the game\nto crash) be fixed? \nA: Which enemies have been missing a falling sprite? They should be resorting\nto idle, not crashing. Bosses?\nQ: Just wanted to say, you guys are my favorite\ngames studio, hands down. Now for the question: Now that the Reaper has\ncompleted his task and is allowed to rest, what’s next? Is the Fireplace going\nto keep him resting for a while? Does our MC have another task to accomplish? \nA: The Fireplace has never let a reaper “rest” before - the reason he is\nallowed to rest is because Ibzan never got to, and the Fireplace is trying\nsomething different with you. This is unexplored territory for the both of them\n– presumably he just pets his cat and gets bored before getting back to work.\nQ: What happens to everyone else in the\nafterlife? \nA: People who aren’t in the Place? Who knows, and who cares about boring happy\nafterlife 😊\nQ: I had a question about the lore.\nThere’s mentions of places outside the city, across the river Styx. What are\nthey and what are they like? \nA: The Styx connects the other realms together, including (presumably) wherever\nthe demons came from. This is explored lightly in one of the demon cassette\ntapes.\nQ: Will you ever expand more on the world\nof deadbolt or are you 100% done with it at this point? \nA: Nope definitely not done, really wanna explore more one day\nQ: What’s your office address? For post\nand stuff, maybe I want to send you a box full of A4 sheets of paper with a thousand\nhoopters on each. \nA: Maybe this is the paranoia in me but I’m not comfortable posting my address\nonline – you can just tweet it at me a thousand times instead\nQ: Did Ibzan think the flames would give\nwarmth to the Dredged or was he just lying to them and using them for his own\ngain? \nA: He was lying to himself, but he did truly believe that this was going to\nwork, because this (at the time, anyways) seemed like the only way out. Metaphor\nwoawoawo\nQ: Could you add some sorta DEADBOLT\nreference into RoR2?  Will the Reaper be\nplayable in Risk of Rain 2 as a bonus?\nA: Definitely references happening in some form, but playable might be\nstretchin’ it a bit, especially since it’d be taking up the slot of some more\nin-universe secret character.\nQ: How excited are for RoR2? \nA: Honestly very nervous for the reception, with very big shoes to fill as a\nsequel for RoR. I just hope people like it, and that we don’t get burnt on 3D\nbecause there’s so many possibilities in the future for our games in 3D.\nQ: How are the Demons born? We know\nthey’re made in birthing chambers, but then is it just like humans or is there\nanything specific needed for a demon to be born f.e. skeletons>suicide,\nzombies>overdose, etc. \nA: Demons aren’t undead and don’t naturally exist in the Place, which is why\nthey have to be smuggled over – they exist in whatever version of hell is in\nthe DEADBOLT universe, and are natural denizens of the underworld.\nQ: was izban hot before he died? \nA: The hottest\nQ: do all the nightclubs canonically have\nchris c. as the dj \nA: Yes\nQ: I love Deadbolt very dearly and i’ve\nlistened to its soundtrack (particularly “Now I Am Become Death”)\nmore times than i can remember. What’s your favourite tune from Deadbolt ? \nA: Defunktorum or The Proverbial Dust Biters\nQ: In the Hardmode Cassette Tape it talked\nabout a Reaper that wasn`t the current Reaper that we play as in the Game. Was\nthis Reaper Izban? Since in the tape, he talked about the fireplace as his\nfriend and that could be why he wanted to go back to the fireplace through the\nportal at the end of the game, to revisit his friend. \nA: Yes yes and yes. This was most heavily implied in Ibzan’s “home”, which\nparallel yours.\nQ: Will RoR2 still have opportunities to\ncreate silly messy builds like covering the screen in missiles or releasing an\nendless stream of Thqwibs? If so, how are you working to mitigate the\nperformance impact of those crazy builds? \nA: Yep! Currently we have a system that detects the average particle count in a\nscene and slowly adds a chance non-important effects (like hitsparks or\nimpacts) don’t ever spawn. This will at some point also involve turning off\nexpensive effects and reducing particle LODs.\nQ: I really love the attention to detail\nto the characters, environment, aesthetics and gameplay mechanics. Its themes\non the criminal underworld and the supernatural give a unique identity in a\nhigh-octane/stealth pixel action game I have not seen before. Additionally what\nprompted or inspired you to make DEADBOLT in the first place? \nA: DEADBOLT in its entirety was supposed to be not-Risk of Rain. It’s a gorey,\nviolent, moody singleplayer puzzle-stealth game. We were just burnt out from\nthe Risk of Rain experience, and we also wanted to flex our design muscles a\nbit and show that hey, we’re not just a one-trick pony of gamedevelopment :^)\nQ: I just played through this game on\nPS4/Vita over the weekend. Huge fan of Risk of Rain. Even bought it through\nLimited Run Games. So I had to pick up Deadbolt (Didn’t previously know you had\nmade it either.) and I love it. Its a super solid experience. I’m not sure I\nhave any questions about it. I guess I was curious if co-op multiplayer was\never considered in development? Keep up the great work. Can’t wait to see what\nyou guys make next. \nA: Nope, because of the reasons above – we wanted a single player game, since\nRoR was a multiplayer one.\nQ: First of all, congratulations!! I\nreally loved the game since came out, I bought it for my birthday, since risk\nof rain made me fell in love with all the pixel art in it, deadbolt didn’t\ndisappointed me!! Everything in it I love it! Thanks for the game!! Now the\nquestion You already answered about how the skeletons or vampires came to be in\nthat Place, how the vampires are killed by their lovers, but, how a reaper,\nbecomes to be a reaper? I mean a candle said “I’ve never been so close to\none” \nA: Originally, the reapers were actually supposed to be from suicides – if I\nremember right, the reaper when going down the stairs to the docks still has\nthe hole in the back of his head in his sprite. Currently, it’s not explored\nhow a reaper is made – I think a bit of mystery is always needed in making a\nbelievable universe J\nQ: Lorewise how many reapers are there\ntotal? Why are they incredibly fragile compared to the undead? What makes the\nreapers not undead? \nA: IIRC there were 4 fireplaces in the final stage, which was supposed to\nrepresent the way the fireplace was communicating to all reapers in the field.\nQ: Do you like turtles? How about corgis? \nA: Yes, and yes (although there’s way too many in Seattle now).\nQ: Did you have any idea Chris would break\nout a whole band’s worth of musicians for the soundtrack? His work was superb\nand the OST remains my absolute favorite to this day. \nA: DEADBOLT OST was actually done with many people – it must be in the credits\nsomewhere! If I remember right, there is at least a drummer and a musician.Thanks for all the questions, and happy hunting :)hopooToday marks the second anniversary of DEADBOLT’s initial release on PC. The game was something very dear to me in a variety of ways, and with more fans joining us from Sony consoles, both our community manager JAG and I thought this could be a cool chance to answer any questions people had about the game. This could include its development, lore, or anything tangentially related. Or you can ask me questions about myself, I guess. Or advice. Or anything.To ask a question, just hit this link here. I’ll most likely round up all questions together and answer them all tomorrow in a giant post. Cheers!hopooProbably the actual name - every time we ask for suggestions we get weather metpahors or 2 Risk 2 RainaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHDEADBOLT is now out for the PS4/PS Vita in all regions! There’s been a lot of hard work to make this game play well on the consoles, and I really hope you all like it. DEADBOLT still holds a very special place in my heart, and I’m really glad we have this opportunity to show people the games we are proud of. Thanks.https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0341-CUSA05931_00-3949703949703950That would totally fix that issue, but would go against one of my own personal design rules when making online games.I personally think that a lot of multiplayer games nowadays reaaally suffer from “instancing” or local events. I think that a lot of the fun of multiplayer online games is experiencing stuff together in the same world, and instancing segments the game into a… semi-shared world. You’re not playing the same game, its like you all hit Start at the same time on a single player match. I want to avoid any local instancing as much as possible so you can share moments like when a friend gets a very rare item drop.That is definitely the intent!  We’re planning on doing a pass on the director and overall balance very soon. It’s a nice feeling that that’s something we can now focus on, because it means development is going well enough that we can start thinking about game balance. Enemies also have a much bigger sphere of influence in RoR2 - most enemies were melee range in RoR1, with affixes and spiders being the biggest source of projectiles. In contrast, most enemies in RoR2 currently have projectiles. We also have to make sure that every projectile can’t be dodged by circle strafing.We always appreciate this sort of feedback, by the way. We’re pretty deep in RoR2 so maybe something obvious to an outside viewer totally slips our mind, so reminders are nice :)",
      "After working on a prototype in secret for the last six months, indie developer Hopoo Games have announced that they are currently developing a sequel to the brutal sci-fi roguelike, Risk of Rain.

Why make it 3D?It would be pretty cool, but I don't think they should switch to 3d, would ruin the feel of it.

      "JiG is on Patreon and Needs You! Click here for more informationI could probably accurately sum up my experiences with Hopoo Games's indie roguelike action RPG game Risk of Rain by adding the subtitle \"the review of many ragequits\" or maybe \"why you gotta hurt me so bad?\" After the cargo spaceship you were riding on is attacked and crash lands on a hostile alien planet, you find yourself the only survivor, and tasked with working your way through each dangerous area by scavenging what supplies you can from the debris (... as long as you can pay... ) and finding and activating the teleporter to take you to the next stage. The twist? You can't idly waste time grinding levels for as much as you want, since the longer you spend in game on a playthrough, the more difficult it gets, and trust me when I say there is very little out there that doesn't want to grind you into jam between its toes. Hope you like permadeath!The game's default controls are the [arrows] for climbing and movement, [spacebar] for jumping, and [Z], [X], [C], and [V] to activate your abilities. [Z] is typically your default attack and can be used over and over, but most other abilities will come with a cool down time between uses. The levels are completely randomised every time you play, so you have to scour every inch of them looking for the teleporter. Once activated, you'll have to survive for ninety seconds, which is easier said than done since activating it also summons a big angry boss monster to deal with, and when time's up, you still have to clear all the enemies from the area before moving on to the next stage. Fortunately, levels and items carry over between stages, though remaining cash is converted into experience points... as long as you don't die, in which case you'll have to start all over from the beginning.Destroying monsters, of which there are many, many, many kinds, nets you two very valuable things... experience points and cash. Experience points are self-explanatory, working towards upping your level and thus your damage and health. Cash, however, is just as important, since most of the cargo cases and chests littering the planet must be paid to be opened. You'll find all sorts of things, from powerful weapons, to items that grant you passive skills or bonuses, even drones that will help you fight. Death might be the end, but you'll also unlock even more item drops and entirely new characters with their own special abilities to play as, too.Analysis: By stripping away your ability to hang around mining levels, Risk of Rain forces you to move fast and adapt. If you wait too long, you'll find yourself swarmed by powerful enemies, but if you don't gain enough levels, you won't be ready to take on the portal boss. It's a delicate balance to try to get right, and thankfully the game has a demo for you to try since it won't be for everyone. It's nonstop action with a deliberately grueling difficulty curve, and it feels like an uphill battle every step of the way. Like all roguelikes, the element of randomness can either work for or against you, and here it's primarily down to the items you find. The right assortment of equipment can turn the tides enormously in your favour, and most players will quickly develop a preference after some experimentation. What might be more interesting is how drastically different the style of play can be between unlockable characters simply because of the few abilities they come with.The overall stage design is admittedly sort of bland, tending to consist solely of platforms and strings/ladders to climb. This actually can wind up getting tedious if you have to spend a lot of time crawling around a level looking for the portal or just trying to get around. Of course, if you have time to stand around complaining about the lack of environmental bells and whistles, you're not doing it right, and besides... there's a certain eerie beauty to a lot of the alien enemy designs. You'll get a lot of chances to admire them, too, since the game's idea of upping the difficulty is not only to spawn stronger enemy types, but to start barfing them at you in staggering numbers, usually while you're already running away from a giant electrocuting jellyfish boss monster. Though the actual game itself offers next to nothing in the way of a story, the descriptions of creatures you can find in Monster Logs paint a picture of a fascinating world.As hectic and vicious as Risk of Rain can be, however, it actually feels quite streamlined. It's designed to force you to keep moving, and the way dropped experience and cash will automatically be drawn to you no matter where you are means you never really have to slow down. It's not just about frantically running away from everything while spraying bullets behind you, since a lot of the bosses and lesser enemies require some strategy to take out quickly and efficiently with minimal damage. If you enjoy a challenge, roguelike action, tons of unlockable items and characters, and a retro aesthetic, Risk of Rain is definitely worth checking out... and the co-op play option allows you to tackle it with a friend, too.Windows:\n     \nGet the full version\nDownload the demoMac OS X:\nNot available.Try Boot Camp or Parallels or CrossOver Games.^ Scroll Up | Homepage >I remember when this was first announced on JiG, as a kickstarter project!Wow, to think it's finally become a fully fledged game. That's why I love this site, to see things like this from beginning to final. :)I can't put this game down! It really is just a lot of fun, and you will die, a lot. But it's okay, because when you do there's usually some new item unlocked for next time :DOne thing i will say is give it a fair shot. Seems very difficult at first but once you start unlocking a few items and get the hang of it it's very possible. I've put 22 hours into it so far and only beat it twice.There's also a ton of secrets to look for, and achievements to get (Getting achievements unlocks new items for use in future games.)And while i agree the actual design of the levels is a bit simple in terms of just platforms and ropes, they are all definitely beautiful to look at :)I only tried the demo so far, but I wasn't impressed enough to buy the full version. The tension between going fast vs. gaining levels and items is ruined by two things in my opinion:1. The bosses have so many hitpoints that you need to waste several minutes of precious time just standing there shooting at them to kill them.2. The teleporter could be in a few different spots so finding it quickly is mostly a matter of luck.Another problem is that the actual gameplay feels stale pretty quickly. Once you master spamming your four moves as appropriate, the same strategy works on every enemy. There are a lot of different items but they mostly just heal you or increase your damage, instead of changing how you play.Still a lot more fun than the average game, and I have great respect for anyone who can make a randomized/procedurally generated game.buy this game... seriously... its awesome. if you stole it... buy it anyway to reinforce the creation of more like it. Its simple in some ways but a polished gem with surprising depth.I'm mostly a troll... this game deserved a post.Its very roguelike... and it takes some time to get used to what \"works\" regardless of character. There is also luck involved with each play through like any roguelike. Some power ups will suit your character, playstyle, or are just better... but the synergy every time is like a whole nother adventure.Considering the way you play or want to play depending on your goal each time... you either rush... or quite the opposite. You can also ignore the \"time\" and increased difficulty as time passes to just get to \"god\"-like. On the hardest difficulty this is a rare but VERY satisfying feat to achieve. But there is a cap to how hard the game gets... if you're alive when you get there... you can keep repeating random maps to farm even more.I miss good 2d side scrollers like this gem... give it some time to get acclimated and if you like a challenge you'll be hooked for a while.As mentioned above... great unlocks / secrets / achievements. Each game is a new play through but you do permanently unlock characters and power ups. Some of those power ups really change the way you can play.I understand the \"stale\" comment... it does repeat itself in a way... but any rogue like has that to a point. The challenge ramping up and the difficulty to do a full run, or fun of the unlocks, far outweighs that being a negative to mep.s. updates have really improved any bugsUpdateLeave a comment [top of page]All games mentioned or hosted and images appearing on JayIsGames are Copyright their respective owner(s).All other content is Copyright ©2003-2018 JayIsGames.com.

      "By\nAustin Wood\n2017-12-22T17:53:35.355ZDuncan \"Hopoo\" Drummond and Paul \"PaulTheGoat\" Morse started development on hit 2D roguelike Risk of Rain in their sophomore year at the University of Washington. It took them a year to finish Risk of Rain while going to school full-time. They've long since graduated and doubled down on their studio, Hopoo Games, but even so, Risk of Rain 2, already a year in development, is nowhere near done. It was announced as a 3D shooter earlier this year, but Hopoo has been tight-lipped ever since. So, when I got in touch with Drummond and Morse to get a much-needed status report, I had plenty of questions.Responses edited for clarity and length.It seems like Risk of Rain 2 was announced pretty quietly.Paul Morse: We waited a long time to announce anything. If we were doing a traditional sequel in 2D, it would have been much easier. Since we were switching to 3D it was kind of scary, never having done a 3D game and it being such a dramatic shift. We didn't want to give this half-assed \"we're doing 3D, it might work.\" We wanted to make sure it was a solid idea before showing anything, and it took quite a while to get to the point where we were even comfortable showing a screenshot or any assets.Duncan Drummond: Our team is really small. We don't have the luxury of having someone dedicated to keeping the hype going. We're working with a development blog because it's easiest for us. Hopefully as we get closer to launch, we'll start putting out trailers, putting out press kits. This is more of an announcement to the fans, \"we're working on this game, we didn't stop making games.\"And it is coming into some form now?PM: We've got it to a point where it's not super scary for us. We've gotten to a rhythm of creating characters, creating items.DD: I would say we've definitely hit a stride at this point where we're less about \"what direction are we going?\" and more \"what kind of content can we create?\"PM: Getting everything to that point took quite a while, but I think now that we're there we feel a little more comfortable showing things off.Why the shift to 3D?DD: Risk of Rain 2 didn't start off in 3D. We had a 2D prototype. The twist for that one was you played as the monsters in the previous game. We didn't want to make Risk of Rain but again. Something I personally really wanted was to be able to display items on your body. This was a key part of a lot of fan art that I saw, and also the cover art. Doing that in 2D was actually fairly difficult. It's just sprites. So we went from 2D to 2.5D just for the sake of being able to place these items on your body more easily. And by the time we were at 2.5D, we were like \"we're almost at 3D at this point, should we just give it a shot?\"PM: We had this 2D prototype for quite a while. But once we started talking about showing items and moving to 2.5D and then to 3D, it was pretty rapid.DD: Less than a month, I want to say.PM: Yeah, one week it was 2D, the next it was 2.5, and the next week it was 3D. And we were pretty much making the assets in 3D and showing them as a 2D thing, so it was kind of a waste. Once we transitioned to 3D, it was like, \"OK, we can actually do this if we want to.\" That's where it took off.DD: I would also say we hit our stride purely from experience. We just are not familiar with Unity. I've never modelled before this project, I purely used Paint for the previous game. It was a big jump for me to learn all the rules and how to actually do it. It was a mix of a lot of technical details along with skill level.PM: Our 2D games were our first 2D games, and with this transition to 3D, we've never worked in Unity or things like that. We've got to relearn everything before we start making games again. It's a pretty strange place to be but it's definitely paying off.What features were hardest to translate from 2D to 3D?PM: I would say the level design. In 2D it's pretty simple to go from a prototype of a level to making the tiles and putting them together and creating assets. But in 3D, it feels like you have one shot once you get into designing the level. And then prototyping in 3D is much more difficult. Do you use Lego? Do you use clay? Do you use other programs like SketchUp? Do you fully make this world in detail and then just make it again? That's been one of our harder points than a 2D version.DD: The cost of time per asset has gone up a lot. With our previous projects, we did a lot of our design via iteration. We would do a very rapid prototype and then refine it. But in 3D it doesn't work that way. A lot of times, if you want to change step two, you ruin every step afterward. You have to start over from scratch. You can't refine and iterate in the same way.I've seen some familiar enemies in your blog posts, but also new abilities.DD: We can't translate anything directly from 2D to 3D in terms of actual gameplay because it's so different. We've been reworking every monster that we've brought back. We found out melee monsters are actually much easier to beat in 3D because you have an entire dimension to kite them. So the golem, which was entirely melee, now has a laser attack. And the lemurian can now shoot fireballs. We also want to explore flying monsters. Now the wisps are actually flying. While they're still the same characters, they behave entirely differently.PM: Another reason we did this is because, early on, we wanted to make sure 3D is something viable and fun to play. That's always our main focus: is this going to be fun to play? We had the commando, the lemurian, the golem, these assets that were easy to create. We wanted to make sure that if this was Risk of Rain using those same assets, would it still be fun? And those base monsters were super important to solidifying the whole idea for us.DD: We were nervous about announcing the 3D project. We wanted to show players this is still Risk of Rain. Our first four monsters were from the original game because we wanted it to be recognizable. Since then, we've made some new ones, and I would say about half the current items are entirely new.PM: We wanted to make sure the fan base was comfortable after such a drastic change. We had to carefully mix in this familiar content while showing it's completely different.How were new and returning heroes affected by the jump to 3D?DD: A lot of abilities are suddenly useless or much more powerful because of range. You could only shoot within the screen in the original, but now that you can see off into the distance, a lot of abilities are a lot stronger because you can target different monsters, where before you were stuck shooting the front guy. Some abilities are also naturally more interesting in 3D. The Commando's FMJ, which shot in a straight line, would always hit everything in the line in 2D. But now you have to orient yourself in a line along the monsters to do that kind of damage.PM: In the first one it was kind of a free ability that would hit everything on the screen. In this one, it can be amazing if you line it up and use it right.DD: On the flip side, AoE abilities aren't as good in 3D because monsters can't occupy the same space. We found AoE has to have a large radius, or the AoE portion has to be about doing damage even if you miss rather than hitting multiple enemies at once.PM: We want to make sure this isn't a super precision-based game. The ability to just shoot and get all these items going is important. We aren't making the player focus on headshots 24/7.DD: We've also found a lot of movement abilities are more interesting with more freedom of movement. We have Huntress in a working state, and her blink is a lot more fun than in 3D because you can blink up ledges. You couldn't really aim that in 2D.PM: It creates a whole new kind of—DD: Dimension!PM: Dimension! With the Huntress being able to blink up and use abilities in the air. It's very dynamic based on where the enemies are, what attacks they're using.Is it still about fighting enemies, collecting items and finding the portal to the next level?DD: That loop is definitely the same. In the previous game we had permutations of the same stages. We're not sure how we're going to do that in 3D, or if it's even needed with the scale we have. One thing we've been focusing on is positional relevance. We're hoping we can make the random purchasable things more interesting based on where they spawn.PM: We have one fully complete map. It's big, it's a good scale. You can explore and go on for a while. If you're just looking for the teleporter, you can do that, but in 3D you can make the environment so much grander that it doesn't exactly need these permutations. If it starts to feel stale, we can add permutations. We have some ideas for that, we just aren't sure it's 100 percent necessary.One of the biggest hurdles with Risk of Rain was the multiplayer. You've said you're making improvements there, including Steam peer-to-peer.DD: We have it where you hit this matchmaking button and it will match you with four people. You can do private games as well. We don't know exactly how much more we're going to expand because this is new territory for us. We do have reconnecting working, but maybe there's some weird conflict down the line. The only feature I can say for sure is going to be there is Steam peer-to-peer.PM: You don't have to port forward. Anyone can be a host now. Risk of Rain definitely didn't make it easy to get online with your friends. Being a small team in college of two people, we wanted the online portion to be there, but it was the best we could technically do at that point. Now we've got more knowledge of the idea, what we want, what people want. This is one of the features we really want to focus on with this one. Hit play and join with people, hit play and join your friends. Super simple and streamlined. We also have the private games where you can invite friends from your Steam friends list. And these are all working internally, but…DD: [laughs] We also have split-screen working online as well, so you can have two people on one PC quickplay to another person on another PC. We have to make sure there's no issues with that, like two people on split-screen join three people on split-screen and now you're at five out of four in a match. Internally it works. We want to keep split-screen because we know a lot of players liked the couch co-op. Getting the multiplayer to \"one button and you can play with your friend\" was our focus from the beginning, before even moving to 3D.PM: It was the number-one thing we can fix.DD: Yeah, we had to improve the multiplayer if we were going to make a sequel.Are artifacts returning?DD: We're planning on launching with artifacts. Artifacts became a lot more important to the community than we expected. We always considered them as fun options. Once you've played the game a lot, you can extend the lifetime. But a lot of people used them as the only way they play Risk of Rain. So we're keeping the concept of artifacts and bringing that back.A lot of the storytelling in Risk of Rain was hidden in item and monster logs. Are we going to see that same writing style again?DD: We have a better idea of the story that's going to be present throughout the game, but I'd still say it's not a narrative-driven game. We'll definitely still do the item log, monster log thing. I want another outlet of presenting more of a direct reference to what's going on the world. We talked about character logs for the characters you play.PM: That's kind of what we did with the first one. We wanted to focus on gameplay, then if you cared about the story, you could read through the logs. We want that same experience. We don't want to interrupt your run with a cutscene where you're smashing space like \"get this out of here.\" That's how we like to build games.DD: Gameplay first.You said you hope to launch in 2018. Does that still look feasible?DD: I have no idea, to be honest.PM: We hope we do! It's just…DD: We've never made a 3D game.PM: It's a much bigger, fleshed out game. Risk of Rain was pretty barebones. It was very fun, but it wasn't as fleshed out as we would have liked. With this one, we want to make sure we've got language support, controller support, everything that makes a proper game. 2018 would be awesome. We don't know what we're going to do with testing or beta, but something in 2018. Maybe not the final release, but something.Subscribe to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

      "8:30 AM PDT 8/6/2018\n\n by\n\n\nCraig TomashoffRamin Djawadi has been composing film and television scores for more than a decade, with a résumé that includes everything from movies like Iron Man and A Wrinkle in Time to such shows as Westworld and Game of Thrones. However, now that he's earned two of the nominations in his category (music composition for a series) for his work on those HBO dramas, is he not only the most nominated composer this year but also the greediest?\"Nobody has said that about me yet!\" the 44-year-old native of Germany says with a hearty laugh. \"But I guess I can see how you could think it. Right now, I'm just super excited because I love both shows so much.\"In advance of his big Emmy evening (he has four previous noms), THR spoke with Djawadi about his colorful composing style, his most recent challenges and a surprising source that could yield more awards for him next year.What is the process like when you're creating scores for Westworld and Game of Thrones? Do you need to see episodes before you start writing or can you do it from scripts?I'm a very visual person when it comes to writing music. I like to see something besides just a script, even if it's just a storyboard or pictures from the set. Seeing costumes or things like that will definitely trigger me. Then, sounds begin to form  in my head. I'll go on walks or drive around while my brain works in the background  to develop ideas. I can almost see the music. It comes in the form of colors — colors jump out at me, and that translates into notes. They come fully formed: the orchestration parts, not just the melodies. Even though they're not always the right ones to use, the initial idea comes like that.You've been with both shows from the beginning. Can anything the producers throw into an episode surprise you at this point?In this second season of Westworld, we used that Wu-Tang Clan song [\"C.R.E.A.M.\"]. They needed me to rearrange it before shooting  so they could come up with the choreography and then play it on set for the cast. Doing that was something quite different because it was for this new Shogun World, and it had to have very specific instrumentation. But that's part of what I love about what I do, getting new challenges like that.What are some of the more unusual sounds you've thrown in to your scores?On Westworld, we used some sounds recorded in space by NASA for when [the show's robots] were offline and sitting in this room. We did it in order to give that room some ambience when [human] characters are talking to a robot and going through code.Now that you've accomplished so much, do you ever look back on that very first time you composed a score?I've got two memories: I would sit at the organ and just start making up things by myself — I was maybe 7 years old, which was too young to even know how to notate music. So I never wrote anything down, but when I'd make things up, I'd memorize them. The other thing I did was, when I would go to school, I'd get there early, and  if my friends weren't there, I'd walk around the schoolyard and hear music in my head that I was making up. Later, as  a teen, I finally started to write down those ideas that came to me.Did you keep any of that music?I think it's still all written down somewhere. I should go back and see if there  is anything I could possibly use. Maybe there's something that would get me into Emmy consideration next year!This story first appeared in an August stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

      "If Not The Robots crashes, Not The Robots will not start, Not The Robots not installing, there are no controls in Not The Robots, no sound in game, errors happen in Not The Robots – we offer you the most common ways to solve these problems.Before letting out all of your bad feelings toward development team, do not forget to go to the official website of your graphics card manufacturer and download the latest drivers. There are often specially prepared optimized drivers for specific game. You can also try to install a past versions of the driver if the problem is not solved by installing the current version.\r\nIt is important to remember that only the final version of the video card driver must be loaded – try not to use the beta version, since they can have some terrible bugs.Do not also forget that for good game operation you may need to install the latest version DirectX, which can be found and downloaded from official Microsoft website.Many of the problems with games launching happen because of improper installation. Check, if there was any error during installation, try deleting the game and run the installer again, but before install don’t forget to disable antivirus – it may often mistakenly delete files during installation process. It is also important to remember that the path to the folder with a game should contain only Latin characters and numbers.You also have to check whether there is enough space on the HDD for installation. You can also try to run the game as an administrator in compatibility mode with different versions of Windows.Your first solution to this problem  install new drivers for a video card. This action can drastically rise game FPS. Also, check the CPU and memory utilization in the Task Manager (opened by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + ESCAPE). If before starting the game you can see that some process consumes too many resources - turn off the program or simply remove this process from Task Manager.Next, go to the graphics settings in the game. First – turn off anti-aliasing and try to lower the setting, responsible for post-processing. Many of them consume a lot of resources and switching them off will greatly enhance the performance, and not greatly affect the quality of the picture.If Not The Robots often crashes to the desktop, try to reduce quality of the graphics. It is possible that your PC just does not have enough performance and the game may not work correctly. Also, it is worth to check out for updates - most of today's games have the automatic patches installation system on startup if internet connection is available. Check to see whether this option is turned off in the settings and switch it on if necessary.The most common issue with black screen is a problem with your GPU. Check to see if your video card meets the minimum requirements and install the latest drivers (DriverScanner will help you with this). Sometimes a black screen is the result of a lack of CPU performance.If everything is fine with your hardware and it satisfies the minimum requirements, try to switch to another window (ALT + TAB), and then return to the game screen.First of all, check that you have enough space on the HDD for installation. Remember that to work properly installer requires the declared volume of space, plus 1-2 GB of additional free space on the system drive. In general, remember this rule – you must always have at least 2 gigabytes of free space on your system drive (usually it’s disk C) for temporary files. Otherwise, the games and the other software may not work correctly or even refuse to start.MaxiDisk will help you with finding and removing any temporary files, not need for Windows or other programs to run. This are garbage files, and you will be very interested to see, how much of free space you really have on your PC hard drive.Problems with the installation may also be due to the lack of an internet connection or it’s instability. Also, do not forget to stop the antivirus for the time game installation – sometimes it interferes with the correct file copy, or delete files by mistake, mistakenly believing they are viruses.By analogy with the previous solution, check for free space on HDD - both on where the game is installed, and the system drive. Often your saves are stored in a folder of documents, which is separate from the game itself.Sometimes the controls in game do not work because of the simultaneous connection of multiple input devices. Try disabling gamepad, or, if for some reason, you have two connected keyboards or mouses, leave only one pair of devices. If your gamepad does not work, remember - the games usually officially support only native Xbox controllers. If your controller is defined in system differently - try using software that emulates the Xbox gamepad (eg, x360ce - step by step manual can be found here).Check if the sound works in other programs. Then check to see if the sound is turned off in the settings of the game, and whether there is correct audio playback device selected, which is connected your speakers or headset. After this check volumes in system mixer, it can also be turned off there.If you are using an external audio card - check for new drivers at the manufacturer's website.DriverScannerThis software will automatically find the newest drivers for your PC and install them. After this you can forget about updating your device drivers manually.* this application was officially certified by MicrosoftSpeedUpMyPCThis soft will automatically analyze your PC, solve any Windows problems, check installed programs, optimize settings, remove garbage from system registry and many other things.

      "99 Levels to Hell is a 2D platform shooter by Danish developer bom667 and published by Zaxis Games. The game has 100 levels which are randomly generated, and they are divided into 10 sections of 10 levels each. Death in a section sends players back to the beginning of the section rather than the beginning of the entire game. In the game, players assume the role of a wizard and start off with a shotgun until they can find better means such as laser weapons or magic. As an arcade game the player is able to look any direction on the 2D screen, giving the ability to shoot, cast magic, or blast with a laser, anything anywhere on the screen.The game's story was written by Chris Powell and Graham Cookson (both have a small involvement in the gaming industry, including running the SEGA-related gaming publications www.seganerds.com and Mega Visions Magazine). It is read in poem form by the game's narrator when the player picks up story books throughout the game.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHardcoreGamer.com's James Cunningham rated the game 4 out of 5 saying, \"99 Levels to Hell is a fun and bloody descent into the not-quite-bottomless depths, loaded with replayability and almost impossible to put down until the poor explorer has lost his last heart of health.\"\n\n\n== References ==",
      "Indie game news, reviews, previews & developer interviewsadvertisementRoguelikes have become insanely popular in the indie game scene in the past couple of years. 99 Levels To Hell from Zaxis Games/B-evil feels like a mixture between two of the most popular Roguelike-likes out there: Spelunky and Edmund McMillen’s The Binding of Isaac. It has the 2D platforming aspects of Spelunky and the dual-stick shooter elements of The Binding of Isaac. It’s a fast paced Roguelike-like that emphasizes player skill and features permadeath along with randomized elements. But in a lot of ways 99 Levels To Hell still feels like a work in progress.The game is light on narrative as you slowly discover snippets about the world and history in the form of audio diaries. The diaries are read aloud, telling a story about two brothers. Unfortunately it’s not very compelling and feels sort of tacked-on. It’s obvious that the game’s main focus is on its gameplay, and hey there’s nothing wrong with that, if the gameplay delivers.You move using the left analog stick or WASD and jump using the left trigger or spacebar. Aiming your weapon is done with the right analog stick or the mouse, and the right trigger or the LMB fires your weapon. The mouse and keyboard controls feel a little awkward and I would recommend using the game’s built-in partial controller support.The controller method take a bit of getting used since the button layouts are unconventional. They are responsive however, and work well once your brain grabs hold. What the game eventually boils down to is jumping around, stopping to shoot monsters, and then jumping around some more. It gets pretty challenging since killing monsters requires precision and your complete attention. No watching Netflix at the same time!The prize is generally centered around a high-score system; killing monsters increases your score amount, and killing them in succession gives you a finite score multiplier. Once you die, you can see your final score and it’s connected to online leaderboards. The primary objective for each level is to find the key that unlocks a door, and then finding said door which leads to the next level.Every 10th level you will reliably encounter a boss. After you kill a boss, you gain a checkpoint. So if you die, you can start a new game on the 11th level or the 21 level and so on. Optional items can be found within each level: Gold helps you buy weapon upgrades, Bombs can be used to destroy certain blocks, Hearts are used to refill lost health, and Special Abilities that give you a permanent offensive or defensive power to help you through the game.In every level – excluding boss battle levels – you have a certain amount of time before powerful ghost enemies come out and attack you. Much like Spelunky, 99 Levels To Hell requires that you not overstay your welcome in any given level; it creates a certain pace for you to complete each level and it does a good job creating tense moments.The game is made up of 10 different dungeons, all comprising 10 levels in the style of its dungeon theme. The levels never feel varied enough (besides obvious texture swaps on repeated map layout).The game boasts “100 levels that spawn at random” but maps just aren’t ever all that interesting, or fun to traverse, which is where Binding of Isaac excelled. Beyond environmental traps, levels will also sometimes contain elevators or umbrellas that give you the ability to skip levels and progress faster. Even with these elements in place, levels don’t do enough to keep the gameplay interesting. The monotony starts to set in quickly as you’re basically doing the same thing over and over again ad nauseum.One aspect of the game I thought could have been better expanded upon was its bonus score objective system. At the start of some levels, you are sometimes given an objective to complete in order to obtain a score bonus. These objectives could have given you an interesting objective like: finish the level without killing a single enemy or complete the level only using bombs. Instead the objectives are either score a certain amount points which basically boils down to “kill a certain amount of enemies,” or, collect a certain amount of gold – two objectives that feel futile since it’s what you are basically doing in every level anyways.Although the maps may look similar, the game tries to mix things up by adding randomized items. Different weapons or special abilities make up most of these and are imperative to making your playthrough easier. The game relies on these items far too much. Success in this game is garnered by getting lucky and finding a shop that contains weapon upgrades or a special ability. If you don’t get lucky, bosses become extremely difficult since your starting character layout is so underpowered.You start off with a very short range shotgun and no special ability. This adds to the game’s difficulty substantially, especially if you were to start a new game from a check-pointed higher level wherein enemies are tougher and harder to kill. It often feels unbalanced when compared to other Roguelike-likes out there. You may go through all 9 levels of a dungeon and find zero weapon upgrades, no abilities, making the boss fight of that dungeon too frustratingly unfair.Visually the game is pretty bland but the lighting effects look nice. I had no issues with the game’s art style overall even though I felt it could have been more appealing. The music and sound effects support the game’s tone nicely and I had no issues there.99 Levels To Hell is a decent 2D platforming title with Roguelike elements. Judging by the discussion boards on Steam, it seems as if the developers are listening and plan on adding future updates to improve upon the game. The game at the moment feels like it’s in a state of beta testing, (as do a lot of indie games nowadays, particularly glaring given the euphemestic “Early Access” term now applied to them when they are in fact for sale on said marketplace).Ultimately this title is, at present, too repetitive and unbalanced to recommend.Rating:advertisementView previous campaigns.Powered by MailChimpadvertisementLast Post:Next Post:This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

      "By Press AssociationPublished: 05:03 AEST, 7 August 2018  |  Updated: 06:19 AEST, 7 August 2018Earth may be decades away from a climatic tipping point that triggers runaway global warming and threatens the future of humanity, scientists have warned.The threshold will be reached when average global temperatures are only around 2C higher than they were in pre-industrial times, new research suggests. They are already 1C higher, and rising.Feedback mechanisms acting 'like a row of dominoes' will then spin the world into a 'Hothouse Earth' state of uncontrollable climate change.Long term, the Hothouse Earth climate will stabilize at a global average of 4C-5C above pre-industrial levels, the study shows.If that happened, swathes of the planet around the equator will become uninhabitable, with sea levels up to 60 metres (197ft) higher than they are today threatening coastal cities.A Hothouse Earth would pose 'severe risks for health, economies, political stability, and ultimately, the habitability of the planet for humans', the international scientists wrote in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The research highlighted 10 feedback processes that were predicted to kick in at around 2C of global warming.The 'tipping elements' could turn natural carbon storage systems or 'sinks' into powerful greenhouse gas emitters.Professor Johan Rockstrom, a leading member of the team from the University of Stockholm, Sweden, said: 'These tipping elements can potentially act like a row of dominoes.'Once one is pushed over, it pushes Earth towards another. It may be very difficult or impossible to stop the whole row of dominoes from tumbling over.'Places on Earth will become uninhabitable if Hothouse Earth becomes the reality.'The tipping point dangers were identified as thawing permafrost, the release of methane trapped on the ocean floor, weakening land and ocean carbon sinks, increased carbon dioxide production by ocean bacteria, Amazon rainforest die-back, coniferous forest die-back, reduced northern hemisphere snow cover, loss of Arctic summer sea ice, reduced Antarctic sea ice and melting polar ice sheets.The scientists wrote: 'Our analysis suggests that the Earth system may be approaching a planetary threshold that could lock in a continuing rapid pathway toward much hotter conditions – Hothouse Earth.'This pathway would be propelled by strong, intrinsic, biogeophysical feedbacks difficult to influence by human actions, a pathway that could not be reversed, steered or substantially slowed.'Where such a threshold might be is uncertain, but it could be only decades ahead at a temperature rise of (around) 2C above pre-industrial.'Avoiding a Hothouse Earth would require 'deep cuts' in greenhouse gas emissions as well as concerted efforts to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, both by preserving natural carbon sinks and using technology, said the researchers.Commenting on the findings, climate researcher Dr Phil Williamson, from the University of East Anglia, said: 'In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm. The wolves are now in sight.'Chris Rapley, Professor of Climate Science at University College London said: 'Previous research has shown that an increase in the mean global temperature of 11-12C would make more than half of the land area currently occupied by humans uninhabitable.So, a 'runaway' warming to a new and uncontrollable hot state would represent an existential threat to humanity and the majority of existing species.'Earth may be decades away from a climatic tipping point that triggers runaway global warming and threatens the future of humanity, scientists have warned. The threshold will be reached when average global temperatures are only around 2C higher than in pre-industrial timesScientists have warned of catastrophic climate change. Feedback mechanisms acting 'like a row of dominoes' will spin the world into a 'Hothouse Earth' state of uncontrollable changeThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change has four main goals with regards to reducing emissions:1)  A long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels2) To aim to limit the increase to 1.5°C, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change3) Goverments agreed on the need for global emissions to peak as soon as possible, recognising that this will take longer for developing countries4) To undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with the best available scienceSource: European CommissionA Hothouse Earth would pose 'severe risks for health, economies, political stability, and ultimately, the habitability of the planet for humans', the international scientists wrote in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of SciencesGlobal sea levels could rise as much as 1.2 metres (4 feet) by 2300 even if we meet the 2015 Paris climate goals, scientists have warned.The long-term change will be driven by a thaw of ice from Greenland to Antarctica that is set to re-draw global coastlines.Sea level rise threatens cities from Shanghai to London, to low-lying swathes of Florida or Bangladesh, and to entire nations such as the Maldives.It is vital that we curb emissions as soon as possible to avoid an even greater rise, a German-led team of researchers said in a new report.By 2300, the report projected that sea levels would gain by 0.7-1.2 metres, even if almost 200 nations fully meet goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement.Targets set by the accords include cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of this century.Ocean levels will rise inexorably because heat-trapping industrial gases already emitted will linger in the atmosphere, melting more ice, it said.In addition, water naturally expands as it warms above four degrees Celsius (39.2°F).The report also found that every five years of delay beyond 2020 in peaking global emissions would mean an extra 20 centimetres (8 inches) of sea level rise by 2300.'Sea level is often communicated as a really slow process that you can't do much about ... but the next 30 years really matter,' lead author Dr Matthias Mengel, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, in Potsdam, Germany, told Reuters.None of the nearly 200 governments to sign the Paris Accords are on track to meet its pledges.The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.Share what you thinkThe comments below have not been moderated.By posting your comment you agree to our house rules.Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.Do you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?Your comment will be posted to MailOnline as usualWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

      "Please enable javascript to view this site.Gameverse | August 7, 2018TopSpelunky fans looking for a similar experience may want to sit up and take notice of this one. 99 Levels to Hell is a recently released action-platformer with light rogue-like elements by B-evil and Zaxis Games. The main idea is simple: Jump and shoot your way through 100 randomly-generated levels and 10 bosses. But, as you’ll quickly learn, that is much easier said than done.As I mentioned, 99 Levels to Hell will be pretty familiar to anyone who has played Spelunky before. Each level is randomly generated with an entrance and an exit. Before you can use the exit you’ll have to find a key somewhere on the level. Each level is also populated with monsters, traps, various power ups, and gold that can be spent in certain rooms that are randomly scattered around. Each level can be completed in just a few minutes, and if you stick around too long invincible ghosts will spawn and hunt you down.The rogue-like elements come in the form of permadeath. Once you die, that’s it. Every 10 levels you fight a boss and move on to a new area of the dungeon with more challenging enemies and traps. Every 10 levels also serves as a form of checkpoint system, so you can start a new game further along, but this will make things more difficult because there has been less time to collect items and get health upgrades before moving on to these more challenging levels.At the start of each playthough you’ll have a chance to pick a character, each with different starting weapons and stats. More characters can be unlocked by finding and saving them in rooms throughout the dungeon. Each character starts with a certain number of health points, some bombs used to get to otherwise unreachable areas, and a weapon that varies between characters. The Magician, for example, starts with a shotgun, while the Major starts with a machinegun. As you explore the levels you may find various new items in the form of weapons, orbs, and spells.Item variety is pretty good. Weapons range from various rods that shoot magic bolts like fire or ice, to a cannon that fires projectiles that do heavy damage on a direct hit but also bounce and roll around momentarily. Orbs circle your character and have different effects. Some are obvious, like how the Fire Orb shoots fireballs whenever you shoot your gun. Others will need to be figured out, like how the Red Orb restores a health point to you if it kills an enemy. Spells occupy your third item slot and are very powerful items that can generally only be used every so often. Some outright kill all enemies on the screen. Others are more support-based, like restoring health or giving you extra time to explore the level before the ghosts appear. After they are used, spells must be recharged by killing enemies.Occasionally you’ll find rooms that you can enter. There are casinos where you can spend money (Or even health, in some cases) to gamble with slot machines. Stores allow you to buy or upgrade items. Elevators allow you to go up or down levels. There is another type of room that provides some insight into the story, and occasionally these rooms will have a cage that can be destroyed to unlock a new character.The core gameplay of 99 Levels to Hell is simple and pretty easy to get into, but also fun and challenging. The weapons, orbs, and spells can be very satisfying, and the way they interact can create interesting combos. Enemies tend to explode into chunks of gore when killed. Both the platforming and shooting are pretty solid, and the controls are good regardless of if you are using a keyboard and mouse or a controller.On the other hand, this being a light rogue-like with randomly generated levels can lead to some frustrating moments outside of your control. For the most part the game is very challenging yet fair, but I have had some playthroughs where I just never found any good items. I have had a few times where I exited a room right into a monster, thus putting me in a situation where I took unavoidable damage. A handful of times the level generated in such a way that reaching the exit was actually impossible. After a while you’ll also discover that the levels aren’t quite as random as advertised. It seems like the developers created a bunch of templates that rearrange levels in random ways, so eventually you’ll start to see some pretty similar layouts.The aesthetic is a bit mismatched too. I actually like the cartoony art direction, even though the animations aren’t as smooth as they could have been, but the music and narration is darker and creepier than the actual visuals would suggest it should be. I’m still on the fence in regards to how well the two blend together.There are some performance issues here and there, too. The game’s initial load time is pretty long, to the point that I thought something went horribly wrong the first time I booted the game up. A few times I encountered bizarre drops below 30 FPS that could only be fixed by restarting my PC. The frame rate problems were very few and far between though; I’ve put about 10 hours into this game so far and it only happened twice.Overall I really enjoyed 99 Levels to Hell. The core gameplay can be very fun in short bursts, and the randomized nature of item drops makes replaying the game over and over again satisfying. Unlocking new characters can change up your playthroughs quite a bit because of their different starting items. At $10, or your regional equivalent, 99 Levels to Hell offers a lot of fun and replayability in a fairly cheap package. Many of the issues I had with the game were rather minor, and not bad enough to detract from the game as a whole. You can find 99 Levels to Hell on GOG.com, Desura, and IndieCity. It’s also struggling in the limbo that is Steam Greenlight, so remember to go give it a thumbs-up to help it get on Steam.Nice review… one might say, ‘frank’.Review: Borderlands 2 – Gaige the Mechromancer DLC5651 ViewsSkyrim: Hearthfire Review5640 ViewsXbox employees get white Xbox One design, jealous?5569 ViewsOuya game console kicks off strong5128 ViewsPath of Exile Release Date, Post-Launch Plans Announced5109 ViewsSkyrim: Dawnguard Review4749 ViewsToxicity in gaming: A relationship between industry and individualNovember 21, 2014Games about games, 2014’s hottest trendNovember 17, 2014Hearthstone arena pro-tips from BlizzconNovember 15, 2014Blizzcon’s Overwatch has yet to impressNovember 12, 2014With Mario Kart 8, Nintendo gets DLC rightNovember 12, 2014What Can We Do to Preserve Gaming’s Past?November 6, 2014This week, Nintendo rolls out the first of two downloadable content packs for the Wii U’s Mario Kart 8.

Thought I was free of that after 3rd grade but mom, being the fundie she is, took me out of public school later on in high school and and put me in one run by the local baptist church, And I had to put up with the pledge to the church every day.  Ended up dropping out and running away to live with Dad in another state after a couple years of that.For laughs, look up the church-run homeschool/private school ACE curriculum.

At one time Jordan's population was 2 thirds Palestinian (not any more due to expulsions).The Palestinian leadership has not done any favours for its people (like Black September https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_September and fighting a proxy war against Israel), however the Palestinian people are treated like second class citizens all over the Arab world (https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/no-way-home-the-tragedy-of-the-palestinian-diaspora-1806790.html) :-Middle East culture is very tribal, with various factions like Sunni, Shia, Hashemite, etc. hating each other. Even the Palestinians don't like each other much as there was recently a civil war between Hamas who run the Gaza Strip and Fatah who run the West Bank.I said the Palestinians are used to fight a proxy war against Israel, again their leadership doing the Palestinian people no favours, as Israel has offered them independence 5 times, every time the leadership have refused it. The reason the leadership have done this might have something to do with billions in their personal bank accounts, and the vast sums of money given to them in aid and by countries like Iran to fight Israel.Politics in the Middle East is like a kids playground, one minute they are your friends, the next they are not.  For example, Hamas used to be backed by the Hashermite Assad in Syria, until the Palestinians backed their Sunni brothers in the Syrian civil war, then they were backed by Qatar.  Today they are backed by the Shia state of Iran, and that is due to Israel and its alliance with the USA who Iran hate (Iran is actually one of the most tolerant states in the Middle East, they even have Jews still living there as well as synagogues https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_synagogues_in_Iran), so by backing Hamas, the Iranians piss of the US. Shias and Sunnis are pretty much at war with each other all over the Middle East at the moment, so I doubt this friendship will last.Due to this tribal hatred, a two state solution is impossible as Hamas (rulers in Gaza) and Fatah (rulers in West Bank) hate each other.  The only solution would be in my opinion a three state solution, however Hamas and Fatah's electoral term ran out years ago, so now they are officially dictators (I did say the Palestinian leadership do no favours for their people), so how will these states be ruled?Many of the Palestinians did have citizenship in various Arab countries in the Middle East, but have been subsequently stripped of them, so how Trump is going to strip stateless people of refugee status is beyond me, unless the first Palestinian state is created for them.There is another spanner in the works, the Palestinians get more aid per head than the Syrians, and that doesn't include the Iran and non-governmental donations, however as is obvious, way more goes to a certain few people than others.Trump's Plan:There is a catch 22 with Palestinian aid. Giving aid to the Palestinians will prolong the war with Israel as this is in the interest of the leadership. Cutting aid will undoubtedly hurt the people (and obviously the leadership). Past US administrations have tried peace by giving aid and have always failed, Trump is trying a new approach of cutting it, a tactic that seems to have worked with North Korea, as instead of giving aid when North Korea screamed nuclear war is coming, Trump ignored them.Will this work with the Palestinians, maybe, but he needs the support of the other countries donating money. I have a few Palestinian friends and they hate their leadership and say the aid should be cut, however the Palestinian people are dependent on aid as their leadership has created no infrastructure or investment into the economy.Various nations around the world have used Palestinians as pawns, and when their friendship ends with Iran, which it will do, who will they turn to?I think I agree with my Palestinian friends and to try Trump's plan as all others have just made matters worse for the Palestinian people. I say \"I think\" because they hate their leadership, and hatred can cause a bias due to a desire to hurt the people you hate, being the Palestinian leadership.[–]recon122334 4 points5 points6 points 2 days ago (7 children)Very informative, thank you! Do you think theres chance of leadership change in Palestine any time soon?

Nobody really gives a shit about the Palestinians, and the majority of pro-Palestinians just care about demonising Israel and wilfully ignore the real apartheid and abuse against them in other countries.  This was one of the points of the IHRA definition, you say you represent the Palestinians, but don't give a shit about them unless Israel can be blamed.The change of Palestinian leadership is doubtful, look what's happened in Zimbabwe.Hamas only rule Gaza and are not popular.

Only the remaining quarter does not hold citizenship.(It's not like that status would even be relevant in an ultimate Israel-Palestinian settlement, they'd hardly be refused immigration to a Palestinian state if they don't hold refugee status.)Also, the US was actually UNRWA's largest donor in 2016 with some 29.6%, more than twice the next largest (EU with 12.9%). They can very much do something about that, such as shifting it to UNHCR, where they're likewise the largest donor (18.8%, over trice the rate of Germany being 2nd with 6.2%). Or reduce payments altogether and have the Arabs pick it up entirely.[–]Reddit_Should_Die 15 points16 points17 points 2 days ago* (1 child)That's not true at all.

Read this exchange on the subject.Essentially, that comment you linked to is conflating specific cases with a general rule. There are specific cases in which refugees under the UNHCR can pass the status on to their children, such as to prevent family separation. But they constitute a tiny minority of refugees, and more importantly, they’re opt-in and go on a case-by-case basis. The overwhelming majority of refugees under the UNHCR do NOT pass the status between generations. By contrast, all UNRWA refugees do. The Palestinians, under UNRWA, are the only refugees in the world who automatically pass refugee status on to their children.There’s a reason that UNHCR refugee numbers remain mostly consistent over time whereas UNRWA refugee numbers have experienced exponential growth over the past half century. There are 5.4 million Palestinian refugees under UNRWA, whereas the entire rest of the world only has 19.9 million refugees (UNHCR). That’s because they use vastly different criteria in determining what constitutes a refugee. UNRWA makes it hereditary, which vastly inflates the number. If they used the same criteria as the UNHCR, they’d number in the tens of thousands, not 5+ million.[–]incendiaryblizzard 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago (0 children)This is a great big lie.

If they become citizens, if there ever is Palestinian state, they might not be able to live in Palestinian territory (gaza and the west bank)Palestinians are already the majority in Jordan, but Jordan pretends they aren't so that their Bedouin tribes aren't upset about being a minority in their own country.Jordan doesn't have enough resources/funds to end it.No one gives Jordan enough credit for how much they have done to help refugees.[–]sovietskaya 5 points6 points7 points 2 days ago (1 child)So here’s a question, if there is a Palestinian state/country, why would they prevent their compatriots living not only in Jordan but also in other parts of the world to return/migrate back to their homeland?

I don’t get it.[–]incendiaryblizzard 12 points13 points14 points 2 days ago (0 children)They would allow them to move to Palestine.

So it's okay to displace people and take their land if they are Muslim? Palestinian? Not White? Is it okay to do so if you are Jewish because it was done to your ancestors?No. It wasn't okay. Lebensraum wasn't okay. The trail of tears wasn't okay. Reservations weren't \"okay\". Today this isn't okay. They are refugees. They need to go home and the only way they can go home is one of two things occur.Either Israel annexes Palestine and gives ALL Palestinians the equal right to return. Because bullshit reasons about Jews returning to Israel also apply to Palestinians. You can't argue that \"ownership of the land 2000 years ago has more validity than being from the land 100 years ago.\".Or Israel withdraws to the border, and Palestine is freed as the ENTIRE West Bank. That includes removal of the illegal settlements, reparations for occupation and destruction and deaths and seccession of East Jerusalem.That's the point. Israel's occupation of Palestine has to end. It's frankly shocking that Israel's given a free reign to occupy another country solely because of a stupid religious belief. They now have a home land. They don't need Palestine. IF they insist on having Palestine, the people are now their responsibility as equals.[–]PM_ME_YOUR_MANLETS 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children)This is probably the best, most plain and simple argument about this whole thing I've seen in Reddit.

People who say Palestine isn't a country because it wasn't yesterday sound like every single colonial denier of independence ever. Do you think Portugal was placed down onto earth by the hand of god?

The land's traded hands between various empires time and time again. No one's asking Jews to Leave Israel...Israel should never have been created. It's the guilt of the West's treatment of Jews and the tragedy of the Holocaust that made Israel. At the cost of Palestinians. After all? What's easier? Giving Palestinian land to Jews or giving up your land? OF COURSE IT IS EASIER TO SACRIFICE THE GUYS WHO CANNOT VOTE! Palestinians were not considered human at the time. Same as Indians. Same as Black people. You can umm and ahh about it but remember. Indians fought to be free just as hard as Palestinians and Black people.Israel's creation should never have occured. It however has. It cannot be taken back. What can be done is a sensible deal.Jerusalem is split in half. Palestinians can access the Mosque, Jews the Wailing Wall. Israel withdraws from the West Bank completely. It pays the reparations. It pays the damages incurred. It pays a fair price for the land it took to create itself to the development of Palestine. The money goes to Palestinian businesses and builds Palestinian infrastructure. That's fair, Israel's created at the cost of Palestinians. Palestine must be created at some cost to Israel. We offer a simple deal. The policing of Jerusalem is done by a joint force. Police chiefs swap sides every few years.Or Israel now owns Palestine and has to give all Palestinians equality. The vote, citizenship, MPs. All of it.Because this is ethnic cleansing. As bad and as tragic as that of the Native Americans.I can't starve White people just because my ancestors were starved. I can't starve anyone for that matter just because my ancestors suffered through the depradations of colonialism.

For  some people it becomes so bad that cruelty is redemptive for its own sake because it hardens up a world they see as being too soft.What they do to gain legitimacy is find an issue that justifies that worldview and expand upon it. There's a smart way to do immigration right in this country but to them that takes a back seat to their overall message: empathy is dangerous. Empathy is dangerous and apathy is strength.[–]heyyoudvd 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)Given that descendants of refugees are not refugees, as per the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there’s no reason the Palestinians should have special status where they’re the only people in the world who pass refugee status from generation to generation indefinitely.[–]uplock 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)What a waste of money[–]yaiosuyej 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)This is illegal.Someone needs to get rid of him permanently.[–]bad_command_or_file 0 points1 point2 points 1 day ago (0 children)Good!

Theres a difference. They are also different from illegal immigrants. Here I'll spell it out for you: \nLegal immigration: I work for walmart in UK and want to see the US. Im a great worker so Walmart are happy to hire me in a new york store. I come to USA on a legit work visa and work 2 years paying my taxes. Legal.Refugee: Im an Afghan who interpreted for the UK armed forces. Now the taliban put a £5000 bounty on my head and Im a dead man walking. Please give me safe harbour or I will be killed and gave you service! OR I'm a homosexual somalian. In my country they kill men like me and I have been outed. If I'm returned home I will be killed. Please give me safe harbour.illegal immigrant: Im a poor as dirt central american/african and my country is riddled with grinding poverty, crime and I have no access to any reasonable health care. So Im going to travel to the USA/Western europe. Their laws don't allow me to enter as I have no useful skills, family, or any claim to be there, but Im going to do it anyway because my current situation is really shit and I think I'll be better off there.Trump is waging war on the illegals so he can have more legals and refugees. I gotta lot of sympathy for the illegals, but I live in the real world. Edit: to clarify; the public opinion in the west has turned against allowing economic migrants unfiltered access due to the high levels of crime and risk of terrorism they bring. Its all we can do to keep access for genuine refugees right now to keep them safe and keep them alive. Push to hard any further and we will lose this at great cost to the human race.Meanwhile whats happening HERE is very different kettle of fish.

Actions have consequences. If I became British PM for the day and my action was to grant asylum to each and every Syrian, African, Afghan and other nationality who wanted to come to the UK, then the next week the PM of the UK would be a member of the far right that the people brought in to expell them.If you want to change things it has to be by evolution not revolution because revolutions spark counter revolutions.

I digress however.I can't attest to his admins policys on refugees, but I will take your word on it that they have gotten worse.

Asbar’s driver was also killed in the attack.The SSRC is a Syrian government research agency, which is according to the US-Israeli-led bloc is actively involved in the development of missile and even chemical weapons.The Damascus government has been strictly rejecting accusations of stocking, developing or using chemical weapons since it employed its agreement with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.Initially, pro-government sources speculated that Israeli special services may have been behind the attack because, according to some sources, Asbar was involved in the missile program linked to activities of Hezbollah and Iran in the region.Later, the radical rebel faction Saraya Abu Amara claimed responsibility for the attack. However, the Israeli trace cannot be excluded because Tel Aviv has repeatedly shown its ability to cooperate with various radical groups to achieve own political and military goals. An example of this is the situation in southern Syria where Israel had been tolerating presence of ISIS and other radicals for a long time until the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) defeated the terrorists.A source in the SAA revealed to SouthFront that the Syrian military has redeployed several units armed with heavy military equipment and artillery from the southern provinces of the country to northern Latakia.Considering information from other pro-government sources, this move could be a part of the ongoing preparations for a military operation against Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and its allies in the area.The SAA has continued its efforts aimed at combating ISIS cells in eastern al-Suwayda. In regards to this situation, General Commander of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG), Siban Hamo, claimed that his group is ready to send forces to assist the SAA effort in the area. While this statement is another sign of a possible improvement of the relations between the YPG and Damascus, this scenario remains unlikely.Order NowFree Download(1) Leave the name field empty if you want to post as Anonymous.

      "Trending:PHOENIX–When the Giants opened the second half of the season with a 4.0 game deficit in the National League West, they knew they’d have to merge to the fast lane if they hoped to catch up to the pack.Fourteen games after the All-Star break, the Giants are stuck in traffic, losing ground and plodding along instead of cruising on the open road.After a starting pitcher allowed five first-inning runs for the second straight night, San Francisco couldn’t drive up a hill that proved all too steep in a 9-3 loss to the Diamondbacks Saturday.“The first inning, that’s a big number to give up and that’s an uphill climb for the guys,” manager Bruce Bochy said. “As tough as it was going, we had men out there we just couldn’t get one more hit to keep it moving.”For the 19th time this season, the Giants handed the keys to rookie left-hander Andrew Suárez, who turned in his worst night behind the wheel and the worst of any San Francisco starter this season. Suárez allowed 10 hits, four for extra bases, and gave up two home runs while surrendering a season-high eight runs over five innings of work.“I think it’s just my mechanics are just a little bit off,” Suárez said. “I’m going to watch film tomorrow and get back and get ready for the next start.”Both D’backs middle infielders took Suárez deep, as second baseman Ketel Marte sent a 112-mile per hour laser over the left center field wall in the first before shortstop Nick Ahmed launched a two-run screamer into the Arizona bullpen in the fifth. The homer was Ahmed’s 15th of the year, which is a benchmark no Giants player has hit yet this season.Despite winning four in a row to begin the week, the Giants have lost back-to-back games and now sit 6.0 games out of first place. With a 56-56 record and 50 games left to play, the slim postseason odds that existed in the middle of July have largely evaporated due to a combination of inconsistent play and injuries that have wiped out core members of the roster.Suárez’s ongoing struggles are becoming a greater concern for the Giants as he’s allowed 19 earned runs in his last four starts. After lowering his ERA nearly two full points from the beginning of June through the All-Star break, the rookie left-hander has given up at least eight hits in each of his past three outings.“The stuff is really good, I think it’s his command more than anything that’s a little off,” Bochy said. “You look at the ball-strike ratio there early and he just wasn’t sharp.”After Chris Stratton allowed five first-inning runs in a three-inning start Friday, the Giants needed to adjust their roster to provide coverage in the bullpen. San Francisco optioned Stratton and infielder Kelby Tomlinson to make room for relievers Pierce Johnson and Derek Law, who both appeared in relief of Suárez Saturday.Johnson was on the mound in the bottom of the sixth inning when a fellow rookie turned in the best defensive play of his young career. After slugging his first career home run in the fourth, center fielder Steven Duggar ranged into the right center field gap and made a phenomenal catch that finished with a tumble to rob David Peralta of extra bases.“It was one of those where you don’t know if you’re going to lay out,” Duggar said. “We kind of got in no man’s land and I just felt Cutch’s presence at the last second. I tried to avoid him and just stick my glove out and just tried to hold onto it.”Duggar met former Giants outfielder Steve Finley before Friday’s game at Chase Field as manager Bruce Bochy was hoping Finley could pass along a few tips to a player with a similar skill set. Finley won five Gold Gloves in his major league career and Duggar drew comparisons to the 19-year major league veteran throughout his rise in the Giants’ minor league system.“I’m just extremely honored for one to have a comparison to Steve Finley,” Duggar said. “I used to watch him and that was really cool. Being able to meet him and talk a little bit, learning offensively to kind of take what the pitcher gives you and little things like that was a lot of fun.”Duggar and right fielder Andrew McCutchen were the only Giants to have big nights, but that could bode well for the club moving forward. The Giants are hopeful Duggar has the ability to develop into the everyday center fielder of the future, and if they feel there’s too much ground to overcome in the playoff race, they’ll trade McCutchen with the goal of having another team take on the remaining salary the Giants owe him.With five hits and a home run, McCutchen has added to his potential trade value should the Giants elect to place him on waivers in August.“What a day Cutch had,” Bochy said. “Just a great game. Here’s your leadoff hitter, he gets five hits, a home run, an RBI double. You’d like to think you’re in the game.”Posey slated to play SundayA night after exiting a game feeling light-headed, Buster Posey was out of the Giants lineup and in concussion protocol.Posey took a foul tip off of his catcher’s mask in the first inning Friday and was removed after running to first base on a single in the third inning. The Giants added Triple-A catcher Ronnie Freeman to the taxi squad as a precautionary measure, but Posey remained active Saturday and if he remains symptom-free, Bochy says Posey will play first base Sunday.Get Morning Report and other email newsletters",

      "The Plight of Rohingya Refugees from MyanmarRefugees Awaiting Future Return to Myanmar Need Safer CampsBangladesh’s Monsoon Season Heightens Perils for Rohingya RefugeesTens of thousands of Rohingya refugees in camps in Bangladesh are at imminent risk of landslides. Bangladesh authorities, with the assistance of the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies, should urgently relocate refugees to safer ground.[1] As of April 25, 2018, there were about 905,000 Rohingya refugees, of whom 623,000 resided in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Camp, 162,000 in other camps and settlements, and 120,000 in host communities.

The refugee area is commonly called Cox’s Bazar, which is the name of the district, but since the refugees are prohibited from entering Cox’s Bazar town, the camps are more accurately described as being within the Ukhiya and Teknaf subdistricts to the south of Cox’s Bazar town.[2] Alan C.

      "DifferenceBetween.comCompare and Discern the Clear Difference Between Any Similar ThingsInterview vs InterrogationInterview and interrogation have many similarities as both seek answers to questions. However, there are also many differences that will be highlighted in this article.InterviewInterview is a process that most of us go through several times in our lives, especially if we are not into business and have chosen to do jobs in companies. We understand that it is a process through which experts select the right candidates for the job. It is a polite conversation between a panel of experts and a candidate seeking the job. It is a non threatening procedure where experts try to ascertain the abilities and capabilities of the candidate to select or reject him. Interview is a one way communication mostly as experts seek answers to their queries and the candidate has to answer the questions in a confident, honest manner. After all, it is the job of the interviewers to unearth the truth about the candidate so as to be able to select the right candidate for a particular job.However, interviews are not always to select a candidate for a job as we read interviews of celebrities, sports personalities, and political figures in newspapers and magazines. We also see interviewers on television where people answer questions volleyed at them by the interviewer frankly in a one to one encounter.Psychologists interview their clients to unearth information about their basic nature. This is done in a friendly manner through a structured interview in a non threatening atmosphere.InterrogationInterrogation is mostly applied to situations where suspects are questioned by police officers to unearth information to come to a conclusion. Interrogation takes the shape of cross questioning and the role of the person asking questions is different from the role of an interviewer. Often interrogation take place in a lopsided condition where the interrogator looks like an aggressor and the suspect finds him in a desperate situation. In the hands of a police officer, interrogation is a tool that he uses to unearth true information from suspects. Officers have to learn how to make best use of this tool called interrogation to be able to secure true and accurate information from culprits, suspects, victims, and witnesses.What is the difference between Interview and Interrogation?• Both interview and interrogation are tools to obtain true and accurate information, but whereas interview takes place in a cordial and non threatening atmosphere, interrogation takes place in a situation where the interrogator looks like an aggressor and the suspect a victim• Interrogation is a tool which is more of an emotional and psychological warfare between the interrogator and the suspect• What comes out of interrogation is confession while what comes out of an interview is true information• There is often discussion in an interview but, in interrogation, there is always an attempt to get the informationComing from Engineering cum Human Resource Development background, has over 10 years experience in content developmet and management.@media (max-width: 1171px) { .sidead300 { margin-left: -20px; } }\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Copyright © 2010-2018 Difference Between.

      "Tom Hooper aka Atomp, (04-12-13)I got in on Delver fairly early and at that point it was an interesting concept with a great deal of promise.  The skeptic in me expected it to continue much as is, but I was wrong. I came back to Delver a short while ago, but only really got back into it for this review and boy was I pleasantly surprised.Delver is a rogue-like, however it is more rogue-like than the vast majority of modern ‘rogue-likes.’ The game is essentially a first person action perspective of the classic rogue-like game, such as Nethack and the like. This is a great combination, taking established dungeoneering, leveling, fighting and loot mechanics and giving them an action orientated twist. This is a dungeon-crawler without the crawling.The gameplay is from a first person perspective, taking an action feel not dissimilar to the likes of Skryim and other first person fantasy games. The magic is done through the use of expendable wands, archery is much like Minecraft archery and blade combat is a click-to-swing affair. The combat is fast paced and hectic, switching weapons and doing so quickly is going to be pretty key in surviving. The game design is based around this with the player making tough choices as to what to keep in that hotbar on the top, because fumbling in the inventory screen is going to get you killed. The inventory itself is a very limited affair in how much you can carry, forcing some tough choices on the player. What you carry, what you equip and what you keep for later are all going to be essential decisions, often made quickly. The levels themselves are a reasonable size, but not excessive. Navigating is made possible through the use of both a map and a mini-map; both are really nice to see and well implemented. There is variety in the levels, with typically no more than 2 or 3 levels retaining the same theme. In fact, there is a good amount of variety in most elements of the game. The weapon variety is very good, with multiple types of swords, daggers, wands and bows in various states of repair. Armour is much the same, with the condition system mixing up what might otherwise have been a fairly linear progression. Enemy variety is also present, with some enemies recurring at higher levels and many appearing uniquely at certain levels or in certain dungeon themes.Leveling up will provide a skill point that can be placed into one of six categories, allowing the player to essentially construct the build that they prefer. There’s no respeccing, so your decision will be pretty much final for that particular character. The variety in skills really allows the player to make whatever build they want.  I personally had a lot of fun with an almost pure speed and agility leveled character. There’s a certain elegance to the simplicity of the skill system, with no complicated and convoluted skill trees and the like.  Instead it’s boiled down to the essentials, which is perfectly suited to the game. It is, of course, a rogue-like so your character is expected to die.  However, there is a degree of continuity after death, as gold earned by your previous character carries over to your next, allowing you to buy some essentials from the trader or mage at the starting camp before you enter the dungeon. This is a really nice game mechanic and aids the player in having some form of progression in what would otherwise be a straight reset on character death.Aesthetically, Delver has changed significantly since I played the early version. The PC version has been updated graphically and it looks fantastic, just the right side of retro but not excessively pixelated as it used to be. The early version that I initially played, similar to what the Android version is now, was perhaps a little bit too pixelated and the experience felt too claustrophobic and ill defined visually. With the latest texture update, that has changed and the sense of claustrophobia is just right. If you want something a little more high definition, there is a texture pack available from PureDBCraft which gives Delver a high quality comic-style appearance very reminiscent of PureDBCraft’s Sphax Minecraft texture pack. This texture pack will put you back a couple of quid (a few dollars), but it’s well worth it in giving the game yet another visual overhaul, especially tempting if you’re a fan of the Sphax Minecraft pack. The sound design has also come leaps and bounds since my initial experience, with the combat and action sounds complementing an amazingly atmospheric soundtrack. On the subject of sound, I would absolutely like to point out a little touch that is the icing on the cake: In the camp, around  the campfire next to the merchants, is a bard playing the guitar in a style very reminiscent of Stalker. This is a little thing but it’s so brilliant a touch in building atmosphere in the camp and bringing forward memories of time spent huddled around campfires for Stalker veterans.Beyond all the technical elements that make Delver great, I really want to emphasize exactly how it *feels* to play: It feels great. The entire experience now is of a game that is coming into its own, where the gameplay is fast, yet balanced, and the overall emmersive effect of all of the changes is reaching real polish. Dungeon crawling has a long history in various forms and rarely has it felt this emmersive, atmospheric and fun.Delver is available on Steam but, as always, I would recommend picking it up from the website through the Humble Store widget. This will provide DRM free copies on PC, Mac, Linux and Android and also includes a Steam activation. There is a distinct advantage for Android users in this approach, as it allows them to have the Android version bundled where they would otherwise have to use the Play store in addition to Steam. It is worth noting that the Android version seems to be behind on updates, so if you’re looking for a pure Android experience it may be a short while before the latest updates hit that platform. Currently, through the Humble Store widget on the game page, the price is $7.99 (approx £4.88) which is a good price considering you’ll get all four platforms for this and DRM free. On Steam the game will cost you $9.80 (approx £5.99) and on the Google Play store the Android version costs $2.11 (approx £1.29). The Play version is the cheapest of the lot, but also the last to get updates, so again I would recommend the Humble Store widget. System requirements are minimal and the game will run on most machines just fine.Game Page (with Humble Widget)Steam PageGoogle Play PagePureDBCraft Texture Pack",

Does the lower priority task go unfinished, or is it \"resumed\" by the system? I feel like it would resume and finish from where it was interrupted, but a diagram shown by my textbook shows otherwise. Here's the textbook information and diagram, just for completeness. No specific architecture or processor is given for this diagram.It states that the C interrupt doesn't finish \"for a long time\", although it's never shown finishing at all (This is the entire diagram).Does this behavior depend on what architecture/processor/system is being considered? I feel like it would, but once again, the book never really makes mention as to whether or not it does.I've done lots of searching and while it's clear that the higher priority task will be completed first, I'm not so sure what happens to the lower priority one.The low priority interrupt is completed when all high-priority interrupts are complete.

      "Tower of Guns is a roguelike single-player first-person shooter video game developed by Terrible Posture Games. It features levels that are randomly created from a pool of possible elements, making each playthrough unique.The game was officially released on March 4, 2014 to generally positive reviews.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nTower of Guns is a first-person shooter that takes place in a tower filled with a variety of guns. The player must ascend the tower by advancing through a series of randomized areas. Each area contains a number of arenas and a boss fight that the player must clear to advance. At the beginning of every run, one of several \"stories\" is selected at random, ranging from a soldier ordered by his superiors to climb the Tower of Guns, to a gun-toting barbarian guide protecting an evil priest on his way to a dark ritual at the top of the tower, to an \"inebriated scholar\" trying to get to a friend's home who has confused the Tower of Guns for his friend's apartment building. Aside from on-screen text appearing at the beginning and ending of every level, these stories do not impact the gameplay in any significant way, and can in fact be toggled off completely at the beginning of a run.\nAt the outset of a run, the player may choose one gun and one perk before they enter the Tower of Guns. The tower is filled with randomly placed robots and sentry turrets that fire projectiles at the player. These projectiles can produce a variety of effects, such as area of effect damage, fire damage, or launching the player into the air. When an enemy is destroyed, blue tokens are produced that the player can pick up to increase their gun's level. The tower also contains various power-ups that alter gameplay and upgradable guns that the player can unlock.The game is intended to be completed within one to two hours, and has been described as a \"lunch-break experience.\"\n\n\n== Development ==\nJoe Mirabello, the founder and sole member of Terrible Posture Games, began production on Tower of Guns after the collapse of 38 Studios, where he had been working on Project Copernicus, an unreleased massively multiplayer online game based on Kingdoms of Amalur. Mirabello said that \"after working on a game with hundreds of people made for thousands of people, I wanted to work on a single-player game made by just one person.\" A pre-alpha version of the game debuted at IndieCade booth at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo.The completed build of the game was released on March 4, 2014 through a number of online clients, including Steam, GOG.com, GamersGate and IndieGameStand.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game received positive reviews upon release, garnering a score of 78 out of 100 on the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTower of Guns official website",

Our games are made from physical sources if possible - like in      the good old times and how we think it should still be done. In our opinion      digital download versions should be tagged as such or at least it should be      noted in the nfo. Also we think that physical sources never could be dupes      of digital versions as well as CD versions are no dupes of DVD ones. All      old and still active scene rules proof that we are right (the new S.I.R      rules from 2009 and 2010 are not signed by any scene group and are not      active because of that).           We bring you games that other groups do not do. We are different, like us      or hate us. You think some games that we release are crap? We do not care      because we think that scene means that every game should be released.           To rise the quality of our releases we now try to make all our releases      both in normal image format (bin/cue or iso) as requested by the scene      rules and also in clone (Alcohol 120%) format.          ▄▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ ▄██▀▀ ▓██▀▄ ▓██▀▀ ▓██▀▀ ▀███▀ ▓██ ▓▄  █ ▄██▀▀ ▓██▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▄     █▓           ▓██ █ ▓██▄▀ ▓██▀  ▓██▀   ▓██  ▓██ ▓██▄█ ▓██ █  ▀██▄             █      ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀  ▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀  ▀▀▀  ▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀  ▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀          0x0815 - 0x0007 - FLT - GENESiS - GREENPEACE - PROPHET - DEFA - SMACKs                                      Razor1911 - RELOADED       \n\n\n\n \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\n\n\nТоррент:\nЗарегистрирован [26 июн 2018, 16:59]\n\n \n\n\nСкачать торрент\n[ Размер 15.48 КБ / Просмотров 0 ]\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\n\n\nСтатус:\nПроверен \n\n\n.torrent скачан:\n232 раз\n\n\nРазмер:\n744.26 МБ  (780 408 579 байт) \n\n\n \r\n\t\t\t Стать Автором раздачи\n\n\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \n\n\n Вернуться к началу\n\nЦитата\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nОтветить\n\n\r\n\t\t\t1 сообщение\r\n\t\t\t • Страница 1 из 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nПохожие торренты\nОтветы\nПросмотры\nПоследнее сообщение\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTower Of Guns (Terrible Posture Games LLC ) (ENG) [RePack] от R.G.

      "How many bullets can we fit onto a single computer screen? We're sure that's what Joe Mirabello, the man behind Terrible Posture Games and the creator of Tower of Guns, must have asked himself before embarking on the project. We picture a breakfast table, where he sits contemplating the great mysteries of life over a cup of coffee. Why are we here, what is the meaning of life and how difficult can a videogame be while still remaining fun to play?Tower of Guns is an exercise in patience, fortitude and old school twitch reflexes. It's an arcade game with an endless supply of enemies and a single goal, get to the top of the tower. The game experience is highly concentrated and according to the developer it shouldn't take more than an hour or two to complete it, if you've got what it takes. Tower of Guns is difficult. Not hard like playing the latest AAA game on the hardest difficulty setting, we're talking old old school tough. Mega Man and Quake difficult. So let this be your warning, Tower of Guns is not for everyone.If you expect a certain amount of progress in a game you will be sorely disappointed. Most likely your first five or six runs in Tower of Guns will take place in the first two levels, the easy ones. You'll die a lot and upgrades and new weapons will be few and far between. Even when you manage to unlock something new the game doesn't become any easier, so to progress you just have to grit your teeth and man up.Luckily the game is generated anew each time you restart, so you never know which enemies, which rooms or which bosses you'll encounter on each level of the tower. The game rewards fast reflexes and the ability to master old tactics like circle-strafing and bunny jumping. Even so it doesn't take much to kill you and an element of dumb luck is essential to get as high up in the tower as possible.Almost everything in the game is made by Joe Mirabello himself and Tower of Guns is very much the quintessential indie game. It looks incredible with a visual style that lands somewhere between Borderlands and Ratchet & Clank. The music sets the tone well and keeps the pace up. The level design is relatively straightforward with ample room to move around and use the environment to dodge bullets. The tower is divided into rooms and each one supplies a new challenge, with only a moment between each one to catch your breath. The doors are opened by shooting them, just like in real life!There's little context for what takes place in Tower of Guns, but every time you start a new play-through you're treated to a new twist on what passes for story in the game. Each time some form of narrator asks you to shoot everything in sight and get to the top of the tower. It's hard to explain but it definitely makes the game a lot more fun to play.Aside from being both fun and challenging, Tower of Guns can also be terribly frustrating. We don't mind games that are repetitive or that force the player to play it several times to unlock new features. What bothers us the most is the lack of forward momentum in the game. You are never told how far up in the tower you got, or how far you had left until the top. When you die there's a statistic of how well you did with information such as your kill count. The thing that is presented in the boldest and most visible font, however, is how many times you've died in Tower of Guns and that doesn't really motivate me to play another ten times to unlock a new perk or gun.We respect developers who leave large studios to do their own thing, who defy economic difficulties to publish the game of their dreams, the one they want to play but no one else in the game industry wants to make. We tip our hats to Joe Mirabello for what he's accomplished in Tower of Guns, but sadly we won't be playing much of it in the future - torturous difficulties aren't everybody's cup of tea.6 / 10 Gamereactor Sweden7 / 10 Gamereactor Italy\n\n7 / 10 Gamereactor Spain\n\n7 / 10 Gamereactor Germany\n\n7 / 10 Gamereactor Finland\n\n7 / 10 Gamereactor Norway\n\n7 / 10 Gamereactor Denmark",
      "Tower of Guns is unique both in its gameplay and style. It’s a frantic shooter that keeps players on their toes throughout its entirety. However, the game’s few follies keep it from being a truly great arcade experience and instead leave it as a mediocre option for those gamers who love shooting things and need a break from current triple-A titles.Tower of Guns was first released on PC last year and received a warm welcome from players and the Xbox One and PS4 versions are direct ports from the PC version. The concept is a very simple shooter that pits players against rooms filled with turrets that shoot endlessly as the players make their way through a 14-floor tower.Tower of Guns‘ unique offering comes in the form of constantly changing rooms and randomized enemies. Each time a player starts a new game, they are greeted by new room formations and varying types of enemies. This was a definite bonus considering the game makes use of permadeath – starting players over from the beginning each time they die.Having randomly generated enemies and rooms helps keep the game interesting and challenging, as players can’t simply memorize how to beat each floor and move on. Rather, each playthrough is a unique experience that forces players to alter and update their play style as they progress through the levels. This keeps the game fresh for those who enjoy its hectic and frenzied gameplay.As players work their way through the levels, they may discover it’s best to methodically destroy every enemy in some rooms, and sprint through others without firing a shot. However, the game definitely rewards those who spend time shooting down enemies as they go along. All the bosses and many of the tough opponents drop various items and upgrades that players can use as they progress through the levels. Additionally, each time a player destroys a turret or flying bad guy, the enemy drops red and blue orbs that increase the player’s health and gun level respectively.Tower of Guns‘ upgrade method provides a fun an interesting twist on shooting games, as it rewards players who destroy enemies, but also punishes them for trying to run-and-gun too aggressively. Each blue orb fills a bar that shows how close the player is to upgrading their weapon. When the bar is full the gun upgrades, making it more powerful for the next set of enemies. However, that bar can lose energy when the player gets hit with enemy bullets, causing the gun’s level – and power – to decrease. While this may not be that noticeable in early rooms, it has a major effect as players work their way up the floors.The gun options are sparse, but provide differing experiences based on how players prefer to approach the tower. There are machine guns, spread-shot weapons and even a contraption that fires saw blades. While no one gun is universally better than any other, players will surely have a favorite go-to weapon based on their play style.This same sentiment goes for the perks players can choose at the beginning of each new game. Each perk offers players a small benefit that can greatly enhance their abilities while in the tower. These perks include options to triple-jump from the start, no falling damage, lower difficulty, and higher health.Graphically, Tower of Guns looks great and runs smoothly. Its semi cel-shaded nature gives it a very Borderlands feel, while not being a blatant ripoff. It helps keep the game visually appealing without requiring intricate visual details. Weapon firing, explosions, and environment movement all look good and add to the game’s quick pace and simple nature.When it comes to sound, the constant shooting from the player and enemies drowns the experience in a muffled chain of gunshots and explosions. While this should add to the game’s frantic feel, it actually does more to annoy players through its perpetual noise. It’s enough to make players appreciate the peace and quiet between rooms, which is counter-intuitive to the experience.The game’s simplicity makes it both fun and frustrating as an arcade game. On one hand, players have very few options for guns and perks as they enter the tower, so it’s easy to determine how to run the levels based on the player’s personal play style. On the other hand, the game lacks a certain depth that would help it be a more enjoyable and challenging experience.For instance, Tower of Guns seems to lend itself well to a multiplayer experience; however, there is no multiplayer option available. This seems like a serious oversight from developer Terrible Posture Games. Even opening the game to a two-person co-op mode where friends can run the levels together would be a great addition to the game, and would definitely be effective in bringing players back to the tower. In fact, the randomized nature of the levels would make this one of the best multiplayer arcade experiences currently available for consoles.Unfortunately, players are left to tackle the tower levels themselves over and over again. And despite the randomized nature of the levels, the incessant barrage of fire from enemies can get frustrating and old fairly quickly.Additionally, although the game tries to keep things simple with small rooms filled with randomized enemies, the incessant enemy attacks begin to feel very similar all too quickly. This keeps the game from feeling like a new experience every time, but rather the same experience in just a different location. Ultimately, every level is the same concept with just different surroundings.While the permadeath is reminiscent of classic arcade games and more recent rogue-likes, it brings with it a certain amount of frustration that has the power to keep players from wanting to jump back in after they die. This is especially true when players have made it to the mid to high levels of the tower. It would be nice to see Terrible Posture Games incorporate some kind of save feature, or even create a game mode that allows players to restart where they died and continue their progress. But of course that’s not the game’s M.O. and plenty will appreciate that.In the end, Tower of Guns does have an element of fun thanks to its randomized levels and simple premise, but it’s a game best consumed a little at a time. While a few gamers may enjoy the game enough to play it often, most will see Tower of Guns as a momentary distraction to be experienced for a few minutes, then left to wait for a later date. As Terrible Posture Games expands the games and hopefully adds a multiplayer option, Tower of Guns will become a staple arcade game for current-gen consoles. Until then, it remains a frenzied shooter that’s sure to both annoy and please those who appreciate the challenge.Tower of Guns is currently available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

      "Bullets from cannons and sawblade projectiles; plasma and lasers and big friggin' missiles; blown-up loot piñatas emptied of bling; these are a few of my favorite things. Tower of Guns is a genre mash-up of bullet hell games, fast-paced first-person shooters, and roguelikes. And while the game isn't without its flaws, it delivers a high-energy rush.The objective of Tower of Guns is to, well, destroy the Tower of Guns. To do so, you navigate randomly generated levels chock-full of cannons, roving robots, and secret caches of cash. Each floor has a handful of rooms you have to blast your way through on your way to the boss. Of course, because you only have one life available for each attempt to defeat the tower's gauntlet, it's sometimes wiser to keep your gun holstered and simply play dodge(cannon)ball instead, though by doing so, you miss out on loot just begging to be grabbed.You begin each run by selecting a gun and a perk. The two guns available at the start aren't anything special, but you quickly unlock others; then you can decide what playstyle suits you best. Your gun options are quite diverse; whether you want to fire bouncing sawblades, highly explosive \"unicorn vomit,\" or the FPS-staple rocket launcher, Tower of Guns has you covered. When it comes to perks, you quickly realize there's no better option than your initial choice--the Bluegrass perk. Because who doesn't want to start with the ability to triple jump?As you progress through the levels, you gain access to additional jumps and faster movement while seeing a marked increase in difficulty. Although the early levels may seem sluggish, the pace ramps up until you've become completely lost in a delicate waltz weaving in and out of the oncoming onslaught. A normal successful playthrough only takes about 30 minutes (assuming you survive), but the endless mode sends you back into the tower time and time again until either your sanity or your body breaks.No attempt on the tower is the same twice, and although many of the levels will appear familiar as you play, there are always new level chunks to discover or a new enemy layout in a familiar landscape to keep repetitiveness from setting in. Even if every run were on identical terrain, for better or worse, each run is further differentiated by the loot that spawns. Some attempts may give you access to weapon modifications or items that make your destructive path easier to achieve. Others may give you more jumps sooner. If you're extremely unlucky, you may just find coins and hearts everywhere, leaving your arsenal a meager sampling of the game's great sandbox.Although you have only 10 guns to choose from, many more can be found throughout the game. Each gun progresses in power with experience pick-ups. On my best run, I had the option of swapping through six different guns I'd found to lay waste to the turrets impeding my advance. My personal favorite was a trumpet that launched shrapnel, but the game's Experience Cannon, which literally turns any acquired experience into a weapon, was certainly the most unique.The game controls are very fluid and simple to learn. Occasionally, you may encounter hitches when jumping, but that usually only happens if you're trying to add too much finesse to your ledge dancing. If you find it too difficult to leap across a great divide, you can elect to fire your weapon straight down and use the game's physics as a backwards propellant to give yourself more lift. Aiming can be a little difficult to grasp while moving because every shot is a projectile, forcing you to consider travel speed and distance.Each boss fight offers its own challenges. Though most are fairly easy to handle and are just larger versions of the constructs you fight as you progress through a dungeon, some, such as the stationary Pipe Organ or the Tilt-a-Whirlesque Egg Scrambler, offer a unique experience you can't find in the ordinary halls of the citadel. The game even ensures that fights against the same boss aren't identical. The most notable example of this is seen in run-ins with Dr. Turret; the level's layout can change, greatly altering the experience by segregating the different areas in which his weak point may spawn. Once you get enough jumps and jump height, some of the boss fights begin to get repetitive, but that's only a concern during the long grind of Endless mode--even then, it's not a common issue.The level design has its ups and downs. Each floor has a number of secret hiding spots where you can discover new items or loot, and you find out at the end of each level what percent of those secret spots you found. Some are extremely well hidden, and I rarely managed to maintain above a 50% discovery rate for the secrets. If you're a perfectionist, the secrets alone will keep you coming back for more. However, you may glitch through a wall that's not designed to hide a secret. Sometimes you're only there for a second before you're shoved back into the bounds of the map; at other times, you may find yourself completely outside the intended boundaries, free to roam where you were not intended to roam. Sometime, you might simply get stuck between a rocket and a hard place. The game is aware of this possibility, and it gives players the option to reset themselves back to the start of the room by holding Y. That doesn't make the potential hiccups any less annoying though. Some of the Ramparts levels are so easy to escape that the game brings up a dialogue window with a somewhat comedic message from the developer letting you know that you escaped the bounds of the map into an area of dodgy collision detection; the game reminds you about the reset function if you venture too far.The game's dialogue is easy to overlook, but it's worth it to stop for a moment and read it. Each storyline is laced with tongue-in-cheek humor and silly characters. One story features you playing as the developer's brother (the composer), and you critique various levels during a conversation with the developer. Although the story has no effect on the game itself, the different stories are all worth reading at least once--you'll get a good smile or a hearty chuckle out of them. Likewise, every loading screen features random punchy comments to further add to the game's comedic entertainment value and to make sure you know that the game doesn't take itself too seriously.The only other issue that can interrupt your enjoyment of Tower of Guns comes when you experience the harsh wake-up call that there is a such thing as too much fun. Whether due to the massive on-screen population of spinbots and bombs, the largest loot piñata explosion in history, or a tsunami of bullets, the game experiences a substantial drop in frames, which can lead to a frustrating, premature death. The only solution to the problem is to spray bullets, pray that you survive, and vacuum up your rewards before moving on to the next potential performance hit.Complaints aside, Tower of Guns delivers an engaging experience that is well suited to short bursts of play in its standard form or long marathons in its ranked endless mode. The game offers no shortage of fun. So grab your gun--it's time to go to bullet hell.We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.Use your keyboard!",
      "What’s your favourite tower? Is it Tower Bridge? Maybe it’s Leonard Cohen’s “Tower of Song”? Those are incorrect answers; one’s a bridge and the other is a song. It could be Tower of Guns, although please note that this is not an actual tower made out of guns.It is a tower though, and there are definitely guns involved. Most of them are automated, mechanised and pointing at whichever body part you consider to be your tenderest. If only there were some method of fighting back at your disposal. Oh wait, there is! Using other, different guns.Tower of Guns comes from Terrible Posture Games, a collective term for creator Joe Mirabello and brother Mike Mirabello (who contributed some splendid music.) It’s a game that does something I’ve not really seen before, but when I tell you what that is you’ll probably say “wow, seriously, why isn’t EA putting out annual versions of that?”First-Person Shooter plus Roguelike.At this point somebody out there is probably forming the sentence “well actually, Paranautical Activity …” I know. I know there are a couple of others. But how many of them have a story where you’re a cowgirl surviving a zombie apocalypse AND a semi-sentient pile of goo conversing with your puppy-loving creator AND a pissed-up scholar looking for his friend’s apartment building? Not nearly enough of them, says I.It may seem counter intuitive to praise the story in a game where 99.7% of your activities involve making things explode and avoiding that fate yourself, especially when there’s even an option to turn it off entirely, but it’s a point of focus for Tower of Guns’ friendly charm. Too many games end up with cloying whimsy when they try this stuff. Here, the tone seems genuine and effortless (a sure sign that it actually took a fair bit of effort.)You get a different tale every time you restart, though repeats will begin to creep in around your tenth attempt. It’s a loose framework around which to hang the reason for your escapades, but like a good short story each one sketches just enough detail to serve its purpose.The charm doesn’t end at these text-based narratives, either. Tower of Guns is a charismatic game full of bold colours and gigantic, absurd cannon devices that fire slow-moving shells as big as your entire body. At times it seems as if it’s one step away from putting grinning faces on them and going full Looney Tunes. The game creates a likeable space, one you’ll want to spend time in despite the obvious and inherent dangers.That’s important, because you’ll be revisiting the same levels a fair bit. Tower of Guns has a pool of rooms that it draws from for each stage, but you’ll start to recognise (in either delight or horror) certain sections after you’ve put a couple of hours into it. However, your progression towards the tower’s summit won’t always take you through the same levels; sometimes you’ll pass through the warehouse, other times you might see the battlements.Wherever you go, bullets will follow. If the images dotted around this review didn’t already inform you: Tower of Guns likes to flood the screen with projectiles and enemies. Pray that you played at least one shooter in the mid 90s because, while it doesn’t quite handle the same, this title will be a refresher course for those skills. It’s Circle Strafe: The Roguelike Experience. Keep moving. Keep circle-strafing. Stay alive (mostly.)Like those games of yesteryear, there are secrets to be found in obscure locations. I’m talking “this part of the wall looks identical to the others, oh wait it’s transparent and there’s stuff behind” obscure. Most of the time you only carry one weapon (chosen at the start,) but it’s possible to find outlandish secondaries in hidden levels or locations.The Roguelike aspect isn’t just restricted to repeating, randomised levels and regular death. It’s also present in the perk system and the kind of pick-ups you can grab on each attempt to scale the tower. At the start of the game you can only opt for a triple-jump ability or the negation of fall damage, but as you progress and achieve various feats of heroism (or fragility) more perks become available. Things like increased speed for an armour trade-off, or the “Too Young To Die” easy mode (unlocked after a damage threshold has been reached) which gives you a huge advantage against basically everything.New guns unlock in much the same way. You start off with a pair of slightly rubbish ones, and end up with access to rat-a-tat laser rifles and a hand cannon that can compete with your foes in the comedy oversized shell stakes. Blowing up enemies makes them scatter delicious collectable items all over the floor, including blue shards that can power your weapon up to more impressive levels. Taking damage will reduce that power level, so there’s an incentive to stop and destroy things rather than just attempting to duck and weave masterfully through every location. Especially since each level ends with an imposing boss encounter.Problem is, the guns feel a bit wimpy. I’m not someone who has any interest in weapon authenticity, and intense talk about the FEEL and IMPACT of guns in games honestly gets a bit disturbing. But even I can tell that the plop-plop of bullets against enemies who flash for a bit and then vanish with a canned explosion is a bit dissatisfying. While dancing around enemy bullets is intense, besting them with your own firepower doesn’t feel as triumphant as it should.Player mobility also feels a little off to me. Tower of Guns evokes so much from mid 90s shooters, that you’d image it would move in a similar way too. That’s not really the case, because while the player can’t really jump all that high (at first) doing so will leave you hanging, drifting in the air. This is useful for mid-air changes of direction if you’re needing to float your way down to a point of safety, but sometimes feels restrictive for bullet-ducking purposes. Unless, that is, you come across a few speed and jumping badge power-ups on your run. Then it’ll get that Quake-nostalgia flowing.It doesn’t have the wealth of items, levels and special powers of something like The Binding of Isaac, but thanks to its rapid pace Tower of Guns does tug at that same urge to dive straight back into a new game. The FPS-plus-Roguelike-like-(like?) concept is strong and, while the projectile play doesn’t feel as weighty as it should, the title will remain enticing as long as the player can maintain the desire to circle-strafe. It’s a likeable game, and disposable in the best possible connotations of that term.Contact PC Invasion Advertising About PC Invasion Staff Jobs Privacy PolicySteam Facebook Twitter RSSHave you got PC gaming news you want to share with PC Invasion?

      "Jump to navigationPlatform: Playstation 4 (reviewed), Xbox OneBack in the early days of the first-person shooting genre, we weren't worried about story, or multiplayer perks, or even any given amount of substance. We were simply more concerned with taking on enemies using a variety of crazy weapons, while fighting to stay alive as long as humanly possible. Doom and Duke Nukem 3D were definitely strong examples of this type of game.So that's why it's refreshing to have a game like Tower of Guns exist. Terrible Posture Games' entry reminds us more of the classic shooter of old, foregoing story in favor of fast-paced run and gun action. It doesn't have the substantial features to make it a classic for the long haul, but its quick, kinetic set-up and progressive difficulty makes it worth the download.When you first start out in Tower of Guns, you'll begin with a pithy little pea shooter of a pistol, capable of dishing a decent amount of destruction, but not capable of doing that much in the long haul. That said, the game is built on a progressive scale so that your weapon powers up as you pick up blue orbs left behind by enemies. Oh, and you'll unlock new weapons as well.These additional arms provide you not only with power, but also innovation. After all, it's not often you get to use a pizza oven of doom, or an iron fist that acts like a shotgun, shooting bursts of fire at your enemies. They can power up as well, and once you clear level 5 with them, you'll really get to see what they're made of.If you survive that long, that is. Tower of Guns has a great difficulty setting where enemies get harder the further you get into the game, whether it's a large turret that fires bullets all over the place (along with a self-producing explosion that avoids close attacks) or buzzsaw-shooting automations that rarely miss. You'll be scampering about to survive, and while new-school tactics may not be so welcome here (all you have are your weapons, a triple jump and whatever perks you find), this game is all about the classic style of play.And that's what makes Tower work so well. While the lack of multiplayer is notable, the ever-changing levels give you a reason to go back for more, whether it's your first time in or your hundredth. There's also an abundance of hidden rooms to find, as well as secret goods and new weapons to unlock. So it's not like your pushing forward into the game will be for nothing.There are also little nuances of strategy that can be appreciated in Tower, whether it's using your triple jump to move around quicker, activating a perk to double your experience points or enhance your performance, or even using boosters to shoot yourself higher up into a stage. There's plenty to take in here, although you'll need every ounce of these skills if you want to make it to the final boss. For serious.While Tower of Guns isn't likely to be confused with the likes of Advanced Warfare or Battlefield Hardline, it definitely has an appealing old-school motif to its design. The game runs at a fluid frame rate and features a variety of levels that scatter each time you play, with everything from a large room filled with grinders to a boss battle lair, where spiked walls move around randomly as cannonballs are shot your way. It runs fluidly throughout, so you'll find little to complain about in the design department.As for sound, it's lacking a bit of character, but still suitable. The music is pretty good, and the sound effects are on the money with the booms and bangs, but there's very little character speaking, outside of the \"love robots\" that you can blast to bits if they annoy you too much. And even then, they're just approving groans.Still, there is something to be said about the in-game messages strewn throughout. Do they make sense? Hardly. But are they hilarious? Yep. It's almost like a story's being told in its own right with these, although you'll probably be too busy shooting to notice them all. If you can catch a glance, though, they're worth checking out.These are the criteria I consider most important for reviewing Tower of Guns.Graphics: 8/10Nothing revolutionary, but the visuals have an old-school vibe that's truly delightful.Sound: 7/10Pretty good music and sound effects, but some voicework would've added some personality.Gameplay: 8/10Vintage run and gun action, with hidden secrets, unlockable guns and other goodies to take advantage of.Replay Value: 7/10There's no multiplayer, and the game can be heinously difficult, but there's plenty to come back to.Overall: 7.5/10While Tower of Guns doesn't quite have the substance to be the Doom for this generation, it's still an effective throwback to a simpler time for shooters, and a game that fanatics of the genre shouldn't miss. Plus, it's challenging as heck, and some of the weapons featured in the game are a blast to use.

      "Contact Us  About Us  Staff  Advertise With Us  Privacy Policy  Terms of Use  Reviews Policy  Hooked Gamers  Community PolicyPosted By Oliver VanDervoort | On 16th, Apr. 2015 Under Article, ReviewsWhen I first powered up Tower of Guns, I had to go back and look to see if Gearbox had made this particular game. The graphical look of the game, as well as the fact that a large part of the gameplay is based around really weird weapons made me think that if it wasn’t made by Gearbox, Tower of Guns was made by someone who had worked for the company or was trying out to be a part of the next Borderlands installment. That isn’t to say that Tower of Guns is really any kind of a ripoff of Borderlands 2. What it does say is that at least, this game is a bit of an homage that takes the first person shooter genre and the graphical representation of the game’s world and runs with it in its own direction.The first thing that sets Tower of Guns apart from anything Gearbox has put together is that this game has long been billed as a kind of “lunchbreak FPS.” Having said that, I had caught someone’s comment about what the game was before I managed to get my hands on it and I have to say that is pretty much a perfect descriptor. This isn’t a game that has a terribly immersive story mode. In fact, it doesn’t really have any kind of story mode at all, unless you view a story as “hey look, shoot that thing that’s in front of you.”\"The first thing that sets Tower of Guns apart from anything Gearbox has put together is that this game has long been billed as a kind of “lunchbreak FPS.”\"There is also a peripheral storyline that goes on while I was playing, in the form of text dialogue, though that storyline has no actual bearing on the game itself. Rather this seems to just be a little thing that is built in to bring the laughs. The one that pops up the first time I ran through the game was that of the developer actually telling me a few of the tips and tricks to get through the tower.Other storylines were of a pizza delivery guy who was trying to find his customer and another and perhaps the most guffaw inducing was when I was going reading a conversation between an apparent old couple that had gotten lost. As far as I can tell, there isn’t any rhyme or reason to the text dialogue and while it is sort of funny, I had to wonder why the developer didn’t put a little more into fleshing this out and making it a real story.It’s possible Tower of Guns was just never meant to be serious enough to need or want a real storyline in the game. This game seems to have been built for those who just want to be able to pick up the controller and shoot as many things as they possibly can. The premise of the actual game is that I had to either blast my way through, or dash my way through a number of different rooms, all with different “enemies”in the form of unmanned gun turrets and flying killing machines.\"It’s possible Tower of Guns was just never meant to be serious enough to need or want a real storyline in the game. This game seems to have been built for those who just want to be able to pick up the controller and shoot as many things as they possibly can.\"Tower of Guns combines elements from a number of other video game platforms in a way that makes it enjoyable if you are indeed just looking for something to spend the next 20 minutes with. Picking up and playing, without having to wait through a cut scene in order to know what you’re supposed to do is refreshing at times. As long as you’re not looking for an immersive world that will really draw you in. The game is roguelike in the notion that the rooms are randomly generated throughout the levels so when you have to start your run over, you aren’t guaranteed to know what you’re going to be facing off against.And you will have to start over a number of times. Tower of Guns isn’t an easy game by any stretch. The game tried to help me out by allowing me power ups if I killed enough enemies and collected the little blue lights that came pouring out of them after they blew up. The little red bulbs also replenished my health from time to time but the rooms aren’t big and the enemies are plentiful and I died far more often than I’m even willing to admit in my playthroughs.Clearly I wasn’t the only one to have this problem, considering one of the most important stats the game tracks is deaths. This is also where the game gets a bit repetitive, there aren’t a ton of different enemies and the ones that are there aren’t meant to ooh and ahh you with their look and feel.\"Clearly I wasn't the only one to have this problem, considering one of the most important stats the game tracks is deaths.\"There are boss rooms too, but these bosses are rather repetitive as well. I went through one run where I encountered the same boss four straight times. The repetition gets even more annoying considering that when you die, you start over entirely. There aren’t any chances to save your progress and start off in the room you died. Of course, the reason for that is because the game isn’t really about making progress.You’re supposed to rack up as many kills, power up and collect guns as much as possible and score as many points. Without a proper story to play through, there really isn’t a huge point to making that progress. As long as you go into Tower of Guns understanding and accepting that premise, you can have a decent, if not great time playing the game.This game was reviewed on the PlayStation 4.Being able to pick up and play is a nice change if you have 20 minutes to kill and you do indeed just want to kill some things. The art style is appealing, if you’re a fan of games like Borderlands 2 or the Telltale Games series. There aren’t a ton of controls to master either. Just point, shoot and jump.The randomly generated rooms don’t seem to have a great deal to pull from and that makes levels pretty repetitive. The best roguelikes will still have a story of some sort unfold in front of you while playing even if they aren’t beating you over the head with it. That’s not the case in Tower of Guns.Tower of Guns isn’t a bad game and it certainly doesn’t bill itself as anything more than what it is. A “lunchbreak FPS”is indeed an apropos descriptor. Still, it doesn’t bring enough new concepts to the table to really wow players.View MoreView MoreView MoreView MoreView MoreView MoreView MoreView MoreView More",

If you’re going to win, you will do so within an hour. That’s a big if though, because it won’t be easy. With random enemies, random power ups, random bosses, tons of unlockable items and weapons and even random-level compositing you will never know what to expect!

There aren't levels to the game as such so once you die you'll have to begin again using any new guns you've manage to unlock (you begin with a rubbish 'pea shooter?' and unlock better and more powerful guns through replaying or completing objectives). The graphics aren't bad. Good old school Quake type.26 out of 31 people found this helpful.02/11/2017Wastelander43XboxRating:3/5Now something to remember is that this game was made by one guy, just one guy his brother's audio and his wife. and with that in mind its a neat little game. the randomly generated story is a nice touch, goes with the irreverent style. but this isn't a bad game, it's just a bit bare bones compared to other shooters. artstyle could be better, and some enemy variety couldn't hurt, not to mention some environmental Interactivity. but keeping in mind this is a rogue-lite FPS made by one guy its pretty solid all things considered.8 out of 11 people found this helpful.26/12/2016RealDaveBombXboxRating:1/5Really the idea of a huge arsenal of guns and endless enemies to use them on sounds great but the tedious AI, repetitive level design and awful graphics make for a terrible experience. \r\rSpend your money else where!14 out of 25 people found this helpful.13/10/2017willzb2000XboxRating:5/5this game kept me entertained for hours on end, the randomisation for every time i play amazes me and keeps me on my toes, the enemies getting tougher each level offers me something most games cant even comprehend.

      "Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelike rhythm video game developed and published by Canadian independent game studio Brace Yourself Games. The game takes fundamental elements of a roguelike dungeon exploration game, and adds a beat-matching rhythm game set to an original soundtrack written by Danny Baranowsky. The player's actions are most effective when moving the character set to the beat of the current song and are impaired when they miss a beat, so it is necessary to learn the rhythmic patterns that the various creatures follow. The mixed-genre game includes the ability to import custom music, and the option to use a dance pad instead of traditional controllers or the keyboard. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in April 2015, being co-published by Klei Entertainment, for the PlayStation 4 and Vita in February 2016, for the Xbox One in February 2017, and for Nintendo Switch in February 2018. Crypt of the NecroDancer Pocket Edition, developed for iOS was released in June 2016.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nCrypt of the NecroDancer is a top-down 2D roguelike rhythm game in which the player controls one of a selection of characters to explore several levels of an underground dungeon that are procedurally generated, similar to roguelike games.\nPlayers can manipulate their character by using either a dance pad, a keyboard, or a gamepad. Unlike traditional roguelikes, the player can only have their character move or attack if they perform the action on the beat of the music. As with many rhythm games, each successful beat match boosts a coin scoring multiplier. Failure to match the beat does not directly harm the character in most situations, but does reset the scoring multiplier and may cause the character to be harmed by a nearby monster if he/she is in their attack path. The character can also be harmed by moving into a monster's attack. When the character's health meter empties, the game is over. Monsters move according to predetermined patterns which the player must learn in order to attack and avoid damage.\n\nAs the player explores, they will collect new weapons, armor, usable items, and treasure; the player's inventory is automatically managed by the game. Defeating monsters yields a number of coins that can be used to purchase items from shops within the dungeon. There are also diamonds that are used for purchasing permanent enhancements to the character's abilities in the game's lobby. The dungeon is divided into four zones of four levels each. The first three levels of each zone require the player to find the exit and defeat a mini-boss to unlock it; the fourth level is a larger boss character that must be defeated to progress further. In addition, the player is limited to the length of the song to complete the level; when the song ends, they are automatically sent to the next level through a trapdoor, forgoing the rewards of completing the level.\nThe player returns to the game's lobby area after dying or optionally at any time, losing any items, gold, or other equipment, though retaining any diamonds they have found. The lobby features shops where the player can spend those diamonds for permanent upgrades before restarting the game or, if they have completed any zones, accessing the next available zone. The player can also access other game modes, such as \"All Zones Mode\"  in which the player must make their way through the entire crypt without dying. The player initially has access to the main character, Cadence, but new characters with different modes of play also become available as the player completes certain goals: for example, the monk character receives one free item in each shop, but immediately dies if he touches gold. Special trainers and other beneficial non-player characters can be rescued from certain zones, and once rescued, will provide services to the player from the main lobby, such as letting the player train against enemies and bosses, or providing items that the player can buy with diamonds and use on their next journey into the crypt.\nThe songs in the game's soundtracks are ordered in ascending tempo across zones and levels, making deeper levels more challenging than earlier ones. The user additionally has the ability to set custom music for each of the game's levels.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the main game, the player controls Cadence, the daughter of a famed treasure hunter who has gone missing. In searching for him, she falls into a crypt controlled by the NecroDancer, who literally steals Cadence's heart and forces her to challenge his minions to retrieve it. She is forced to fight through the crypt's dungeon with her actions tied to the beat of the music and her heart, so as to stay alive and defeat the NecroDancer.\nNear the heart of the crypt, Cadence finds one of the NecroDancer's minions named \"Dead Ringer\". She defeats him, revealing that it was her missing father and frees him from the NecroDancer's control, allowing him to help her defeat the NecroDancer. They take the NecroDancer's magical golden Lute and use it to kill him, and then use its power to resurrect Cadence's dead mother, Melody. However, they discover that the lute is cursed; Melody must keep playing it forever to sustain her life, but the lute will gradually consume her humanity just as it did to the NecroDancer. Melody enters the crypt in search of answers and a way to break the curse of the lute.\nWhen Melody reaches the end of the crypt, she uses the Golden Lute to resurrect the NecroDancer and find answers, but he attacks and Melody defeats him. The NecroDancer tries to flee, but is cast into a crevice by Aria (Melody's mother) who was lying in a coffin with a dagger in her chest and is brought back to life by the Lute. Aria reveals that she knows how to break the curse of the lute, but was betrayed by the NecroDancer and left for dead. Intending to finish what she started, she begins her ascent out of the crypt in search of a shrine that will destroy the lute once and for all.\nWhen Aria reaches the shrine, she is attacked by the lute itself, which mutates into a large monster in an attempt to save itself from destruction. After defeating the lute's monster form, Aria sacrifices her life to destroy the cursed instrument, returning Melody to full life and allowing her to return to her family, who later bury Aria together.\n\n\n== Development ==\nCrypt of the NecroDancer was a creation of programmer Ryan Clark, inspired by thinking about the traditional structure of roguelike games. Clark found that the player-character's death in roguelikes often occurred due to conditions created by the procedural-generation of the game as opposed to player's skill, and wanted to make a game that was more \"fair\" to the player to escape or avoid seemingly difficult situations. Clark considered how games like Spelunky put the player more in control of their fate, as he viewed it as \"a game that is really hard but you can still improve. If you die, you still know it was your fault\" whereas in other games a player might die because \"the game is simply unfair.\" However, Clark also found that removing the turn-based nature of roguelike in games like Spelunky or FTL: Faster Than Light lost some of the flavor of roguelikes, and sought a way to maintain the turn-based nature. They came up with the idea of using turns where each turn lasted only a short amount of real time; as such the \"lack of time to think renders impossible the careful study and patience of the expert NetHack player\". With this concept, Clark recognized that this was similar to beat-matching rhythm games, and quickly refined the concept around the rhythm-based roguelike game. The title came after discovering this concept, and plays on the pun of the word \"necromancer\".Initially, Clark programmed the game to require the player to be relatively accurate to the music's beat, similar to the accuracy used by rhythm games. He found this timing to be too tense, as the player was more likely to miss the short accuracy window while stressed and would lead to the character being harmed, creating more stress on the player. Instead, he greatly expanded the accuracy window, as well as programmed a simple autocalibration system that recognized if the player was ahead or behind the beat to some degree as to match the player's current stress levels, both aimed to help make the game more fair and remove player frustration. Furthermore, he found that when he had the player move on the beat and monsters on the half-beat, the game played too closely to a roguelike and instead had all characters move on the beat, with the player's action having priority, which while posed a few drawbacks he had to program around, felt much more natural to the game.The Beat tracking algorithm used in the game is known as Multifeature Beat tracker. It is implemented in the Essentia framework and determines the positions of the beats in order to estimate the beats per minute, which is then used to set the tempo for the game.\nThe game was developed using the Monkey X programming language.The game was released on Steam early access on July 30, 2014, using public feedback to improve the title, with full release on April 23, 2015. The game was released for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on February 2, 2016. An iOS version, with support for both screen and Bluetooth controllers, was released on June 30, 2016.  An Xbox One version of the game was released on February 10, 2017. A Nintendo Switch version was released on February 1, 2018, which includes a new character exclusive to the platform as well as co-operative support.The developers announced plans to release a prequel expansion, Crypt of the NecroDancer: Amplified, to the game in September 2016. They \nintroduced this expansion through Early Access on Steam starting on January 24, 2017 to get feedback during development. The expansion includes an additional zone, a new boss named Fortissimole, a new protagonist called Nocturna, new non-main characters named Diamond, Mary and Tempo, a new soundtrack by OverClocked Remix, and new items for the game, including familiars for the protagonist.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Danny Baranowsky, designed to vary in speed and rhythmic complexity the farther the player gets within the game. The game has four additional soundtracks: an EDM soundtrack by Alex Esquivel (\"A_Rival\") from group Super Square, a heavy metal soundtrack by YouTube personality Jules Conroy, better known as \"FamilyJules\", a \"freestyle retro\" soundtrack by composer Jake Kaufman, also known as \"virt\", and a synthwave soundtrack by various artists from Girlfriend Records.The Crypt of the Necrodancer Amplified DLC added a fifth additional soundtrack by OverClocked ReMix.The Xbox One version of the game added a sixth additional soundtrack by Chipzel.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCritical reception was positive. Destructoid named the game one of their favorite entries at PAX Prime 2013, and praised its execution. Joystiq also gave the game a positive review.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

It was the #1 selling game on Steam at its Early Access launch, and the #3 top rated Steam game of all time at its full launch.Crypt of the NecroDancer was born of the desire to make a roguelike game \"fair\".  As a roguelike gamers, we have seen our share of deaths!  But the most frustrating deaths are those from which we learn nothing, or had no chance to avoid.  Some roguelikes, like Nethack, boast fairly high win rates for elite players.  This is good -- it indicates that, while there is randomness, there are ways to tame that randomness and overcome it.  However, to become such an elite Nethack player requires dedicated study of it's lore, an excellent memory, and patience.  We wanted to create a game that is fair (a high win rate among elite players), yet without the onerous knowledge requirements.  Crypt of the NecroDancer is our attempt at achieving this goal.  It is turn based, but the turns are of an enforced length.  Lack of time to think renders impossible the careful study and patience of the expert NetHack player.  Instead, skill and experience in battle rule the day.  No more random deaths -- there is always a way out, for the skilled NecroDancer player!Ryan ClarkDesign, programmingTed MartensPixel art and animationDanny BaranowskyComposerOliver TrujilloProgrammingKevin Regamey, Jeff Tangsoc (PowerUp Audio)Sound DesignJesse TurnerHigh res artMarlon WiebeTrailers and cutscenesHeather WilsonProducer and Community ManagerInquiries[email protected]Twittertwitter.com/NecroDancerGameFacebookfacebook.com/CryptOfTheNecroDancerWebbraceyourselfgames.comUSD$14.99",
      "By\nChris Thursten\n2015-05-12T16:07:07.131ZReviewA beautifully designed, tough, and cheerful roguelike that rewards perseverance with a singular feeling of finesse.Unlike many games that carry the label, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a roguelike that is actually quite a bit like Rogue. You control a lone hero in a grid-based dungeon, pushing back the fog of war square by square as you explore each randomly-generated set of chambers. As you journey deeper you gather gear, spells and consumables to help you survive encounters with monsters who behave according to predictable routines. If you die, you start over from the beginning.In a traditional roguelike, your greatest asset is the time you're afforded to think, assess, plan. Crypt of the Necrodancer's defining flourish is that it reduces your thinking time to the space between two beats on the soundtrack. Move to the rhythm and you build up a multiplier, turning the ground into an illuminated dancefloor and boosting the gold you earn from every kill. In order to be able to afford the best gear, then, you should always be moving. Move thoughtlessly, however, and you'll die. The result is a game where you are always taking action but only sporadically acting well. What was once a meditative, considered experience becomes a rush of on-the-fly strategy and occasional finesse—becomes, in short, a dance.Every enemy introduces a new pattern to learn, from oozes that bounce back and forth along set routes to shield-bearing skeletons that need to be dodged from the front and disarmed from the side. Initially, you'll scrape through these encounters by relying on your reactions. In order to really progress, however, you need to memorise each pattern and then practice enough for the right counters to become second nature. This process is further complicated by your gear. Different weapons have different attack patterns and your options are expanded laterally by magic rings, spells, and the ability to tunnel through walls. The optimal approach to a given room, then, is something you'll need to figure out fresh every time you play. It's here that Necrodancer's skill ceiling rockets upwards, and where the game becomes essential for players who love mastering complex combat systems.In most rhythm games, the pattern you need to follow is right there on the screen. Here, the pattern is something you learn to perceive. One of the most gratifying feelings a roguelike can convey is the sense that your understanding has tangibly improved despite repeated failure. Crypt of the Necrodancer nails that feeling. You start out clumsy and improvisational and many hours later you come out graceful and confident. This is a point of powerful confluence between the roguelike and the rhythm game, and Necrodancer's devs make the most of it.The core game follows the Spelunky model of four main worlds subdivided into individual levels, although Necrodancer inserts clever boss battles between each one. To make progress more palatable for those still learning, you can take on each world one by one if you'd prefer not to be reset to the beginning every time. In this mode, you're also able to rescue NPCs that sell permanent upgrades. This provides you with a way to gradually make a tough section accessible, evening out the formidable difficulty curve and ensuring that you'll (eventually) see the ending.You also unlock new characters as you go, and these fundamentally change what the game is about. Bard, for example, doesn't need to move to the beat at all. Dove can't attack, but unlike other characters doesn't need to defeat mini-bosses to open up exits. Eli can't use regular weapons but can plant and kick infinite bombs, turning Necrodancer into Bomberman with a beat. Combine them with local co-op, Steam Workshop mod support, daily challenges and extreme difficulty options to consider and you have a simple game with a vast amount of long-term potential.It's full of lovely little touches, from the way that the shopkeeper sings along to the soundtrack (provided you're not using your own music, which is also an option) to the way the simple animations for each creature sync up with the rhythm. The music's great too, as you'd expect—playful, punchy and varied.Crypt of the Necrodancer strikes the balance between charm, readability and difficulty that is so important for a game of this type, and it does so off the back of a set of brilliantly-executed new ideas. It's not just a good rhythm-action game and a good roguelike: saying so suggests that the two might be divisible in some way. In this case, they're not.What Is It? Rhythm-based roguelike that demands coordination and perseverance.

The main catch of this game is to move with the beat, in doing so you navigate through the various levels and able to attack. Items are key to making it throughout the various levels which are gained by either the shop keeper or random chests. Every level is randomly generated levels meaning no level will ever feel similar.

      "JiG is on Patreon and Needs You! Click here for more informationWelcome to the beginning of our coverage on interesting indie funding projects (Kickstarter, IndieGoGo), Steam Greenlight games, and news and previews!Platform: PC/Mac\nDRM: Steam\nDeveloper: Brace Yourself Games\nGenre: Roguelike/Rhythm Adventure/Awesomesauce\nPlanned Release: Unknown/Early Access Late 2013\nPrice: $14.99USD ($13.99USD if preordered)\nOfficial WebsiteThere are no words for how badly I want to play the upcoming roguelike/rhythm game Crypt of the NecroDancer, and if the soul of a funky fresh dancer lives within you, or if you just refuse to admit your random thrashing looks nothing like dancing, then chances are you'll feel the same. From Brace Yourself Games comes a tale of a gutsy young woman whose beating heart is stolen when she accidentally falls into the tomb of an ancient wizard and awakens him. Now, she ventures forth into the (procedurally generated) crypt to recover it, facing off against dragons, zombies, skeletons and much more, gathering weapons and upgrades... through the magic of dance!See, Crypt of the NecroDancer's gimmick is that you can play it with either your keyboard or a dance pad, turning the turn-based classic roguelike gameplay into a test of strategy, timing, and of course, rhythm. Rather than being able to hem and haw until you choose the perfect mode of attack for any situation, you'll be forced to act within a certain amount of time. Each beat of the music is a turn, and nailing the music allows you to rack up multipliers. Typically, time limits, even musical ones, are the sort of thing that tends to make a lot of players begin the Hedging Noise Symphony, but Crypt of the NecroDancer promises to be accessible to players of any skill level rather than the typical punishing difficulty usually associated with roguelikes. Throw in the ability to use your own Dance Dance Revolution pad and MP3s if you like and I'm sold. Yes, I'm going to be slaying monsters to Don't Stop Believin' and Smile, Smile, Smile... and I'm not sorry..It doesn't hurt that the game looks gorgeous as well, with a colourful pixel style, and the game's own soundtrack is downright awesome enough that you might not find yourself immediately reaching for those MP3s off the bat. Interestingly, the developers are \"developing the game publicly\", so you can follow along in the forums instead of just peering in their windows under the cover of night like usual. Crypt of the NecroDancer will hit Steam in Early Access sometime later this year, and you can pre-order the game for $13.99USD (a 10% discount) to help it along. Check out the official website for trailers, screenshots, and even more information!^ Scroll Up | Homepage >Hello, while a lot of people probably like this new kind of review, me I have to say that the main reason why I check jayisgames only, instead of indiegames.com for example, is because you do not post dozen of teasers of some games until they are released.This goes in this way, so, could it be possible for example, to be able to customize the rss feed, like by not receiving posts with some tags (in my case I would also add \"mobile\" since I don't own an android/iphone and most likely never will) ? The rss feed not displaying game images, it may be better to be able to customize directly on the website although.Thanks for reading.Hi zzzzz. :) I understand that you aren't interested in these previews, but they're something we've wanted to do for a while and people have asked for. I don't think two articles in three days is a lot, personally, and I have always been careful and clear in descriptions that show up in the RSS feed to mark these (\"Coming later this year\", for instance) as non-reviews, and the appropriate tags display as well which should allow you to know to ignore them.Barring that, bookmarking https://jayisgames.com/browser/ and https://jayisgames.com/indie/ should suit your needs fine I hope in the meantime if we can't find any other solution. :)Thanks for replying that quickly, I will do with that.Oooh, I remember hearing about this game! I'm still on the fence about whether to get it or not, although the option of using my dance mat is so very tempting. I might wait until a few LPers give it a once-over.On an unrelated note, I have now decided that Dora and I are possible alternate reality twins, due to our similar tastes in humor/music, but more than likely different upbringings and such. :PPersonally I'm glad to finally see more indie games being talked about here. I'm not really a big gamer but recently have been looking for more info about things that aren't flash games or Big Fish offerings. A lot of my recent game purchases have been things I've discovered via Humble Bundles/similar or browsing for indie games elsewhere. Jayisgames is my daily reading, and I'm happy that I won't have to hunt around to find out about other games - keeping my RSS feeds cleaner and ensuring my time is better spent playing and not researching.UpdateLeave a comment [top of page]All games mentioned or hosted and images appearing on JayIsGames are Copyright their respective owner(s).All other content is Copyright ©2003-2018 JayIsGames.com.

      "The indie gaming scene is filled with roguelike dungeon crawlers, especially those sporting a pixelated visual style, and Crypt of the Necrodancer, coming from Brace Yourself Games, is no exception.However, as its name suggests, it's a bit more than just your regular dungeon crawling experience. Instead of slowly maneuvering your way through randomly generated crypts while fighting different enemies, you dance your way through them.In order to defeat foes and keep earning as much loot and currency as possible, you need to match the beat of the song and keep doing that until you find the exit. As you can imagine, this is easier said than done, but the game manages to remain accessible and keep the soundtrack as varied as possible, while throwing in the option to use your own songs.Does Crypt of the Necrodancer play a successful tune or should we just stop moving? Let's find out.Roguelike games are never that fond of complex stories, and Crypt of the Necrodancer isn't an exception. It does open with the narrative involving the main protagonist, a young girl named Cadence, who must travel through various dungeons to complete her escape, after being resurrected by a necromancer.You meet an opera-singing merchant along the way, as well as various non-playable characters that can help make your randomly generated adventures a bit easier to tackle. There are also plenty of different unlockable protagonists with different side stories, so you'll still have reasons to keep going besides the catchy soundtrack and its remixes.Without a doubt, the rhythm-based movement and combat system in Necrodancer is one of the most refreshing in years and definitely one of the most outlandish ones. While in theory it sounds interesting, once you begin to think about putting it into practice, you can already see potential problems.Fortunately, Brace Yourself Games has managed to overcome most of the possible obstacles by implementing an easy to learn yet hard to master beat-matching system. In case you can't really match what you're hearing, you have a heart that's pumping to the beat, so you can always try to follow it instead.Matching the beat isn't mandatory, but skipping it causes you to lose your coin multiplier and leaves you exposed to enemy attacks. As such, you might want to keep things constant, even though that's easier said than done.If you really can't match a beat to save your virtual life, you can pick Bard, one of the unlocked characters alongside Cadence, who doesn’t need to stick to the beat. Instead, his movement prompts movement from the enemies on the screen. As such, you're more or less treated to a game of virtual chess, as you have to constantly ensure that you keep your enemies in a vulnerable state or know when to get out of possible converging paths.Speaking of enemies, they are extremely varied, as befitting of a roguelike experience, starting with slime balls and continuing with bats, skeletons, zombies, dragons, and much more. Some sit still or have simple patrol patterns but others are much more dynamic, and if you aren't careful, they can easily diminish your hearts and cause you to restart.To make things easier, you wield a shovel and a basic sword in the beginning but can unlock all sorts of new things by either finding them in the levels or by spending the in-game gold or the in-game diamonds. The coins can be spent at the shops scattered throughout the levels, while the diamonds are used in the main hub zone to unlock items that you can then find in chests during the actual stages.Besides finding weapons and loot, you also uncover new items throughout your adventures. These include consumables like turkey legs or apples that replenish your hearts, but also one-time use scrolls to unleash deadly fire blasts and other such things, not to mention spells.The main downside is that using them means pressing, as standard, combinations of the arrow keys on the keyboard. This is a bit awkward at first and still means that you have to take your eyes off the action to see what combination is needed. When you're swarmed by foes or unsure where to go, this action can lead to death or at least some lost health.Death is pretty much a given in roguelike experiences, and while Crypt of the Necrodancer does alleviate some of the frustration with its charm and innovative system, it can still wear on your nerves, especially if you don't really like the specific song in that instance.The game can be played cooperatively with a friend, but things can get even more hectic as you're trying to stick to the beat and coordinate your attacks or movement.There are quite a lot of unlockable characters besides Cadence and Bard, including a monk that dies when picking up gold but can get one free item each visit to the store, or Dove, who doesn't kill enemies and can walk through exits without defeating the necessary bosses. They each provide different gameplay paradigm shifts, and it's quite fun to switch them up, at least until you get killed and grow weary.Crypt of the Necrodancer sports a pretty good pixelated style that manages to feel custom even though it's been used by many other indie games nowadays. The visual effects are good and the character models, even the enemies, look sharp.Of course, the main aspect is the soundtrack, which comes in three distinct variations, as there's a standard one, a rock-themed remix, as well as an EDM one. Throw in the possibility of playing your own songs and you're in for a varied time.",

Also present in the items folder are copies of four other armor sprites (including goldmail) renamed with the word spiked added to them. The quality of the goldmail sprite is high enough to suggest that it was removed late in development.These images were found in the entities folder, as a skeleton spearman, toad and mother slime. The spearman and toad are minor edits of the regular white skeleton sprite.

      "It’s not often that I look at a game and think “goodness me, this would make a brilliant arcade machine.” About the only thing the humble arcade cabinet can offer to gaming right now is the chance to play with peripherals that are too outrageously big and expensive to keep in your closet alongside your plastic Rock Band bits and pieces, but it’s rare that such an offer is strong enough to overcome my natural distaste for loud rooms, suspiciously sticky controllers, and an overwhelming smell of hot plastic.Consider it an unconventional mark of praise, then, that I’d go out of my way to play on a Crypt of the NecroDancer arcade machine. I can see it now: a matte-black repurposed DDR cabinet, impractical and heavy, painted with the lurid artwork of the loading screen, waiting to explode with light and sound at the slightest provocation. Even the intro cinematic is the kind of animated, condensed affair that you could easily see looping over and over in a dim corner somewhere: Cadence, the game’s protagonist - I hope you like music puns, by the way - is out digging in a graveyard looking for the titular crypt, when she finds it by way of a sudden collapse. The Necrodancer finds her near-death, and being a public-spirited sort who needs no excuse to practice his art, forces her ailing heart to beat to the music in the crypt - a small price to pay for free medical attention - before vanishing into its depths. Such is the slightly convoluted explanation for Crypt of the NecroDancer’s main gameplay premise: classic tile-based roguelike gameplay timed to the beat of Danny Baranowsky’s remarkably varied soundtrack.In a roundabout sort of way, Crypt of the NecroDancer’s rhythm-driven gameplay not only makes perfect sense, but makes me wonder why nothing like it has been tried before. Combat in traditional roguelikes has always been something of a turn-based dance; carefully stepping here and there, into recently-vacated space and away from encroaching foes, to maximise damage and dodge enemy attacks. Necrodancer - I'm just going to call it Necrodancer, because stylised capitalisation is the work of language heretics - simply speeds things up a little bit and designs itself to fit. Instead of having all the time in the world to ponder your next move, you and everything else in the dungeon are compelled to move to the inexorable beat of the song. Suddenly, through this one small change, the game becomes an intense exercise in constant planning, thinking ahead, and split-second decision making. Situations that you could have once tackled over the course of a few minutes now have to be solved in seconds, all while moving to that overpowering beat. Within moments of entering a room, you need a plan. Step left, step up, lunge at the skeleton, dig out a wall to skip a beat, cut the slime that just moved into range, dodge the fireball, step around the trap tile... whoops, looks like you didn't take that wind wizard into account, you dolt. Now you've been pulled off course, you've missed a beat, dropped your coin multiplier, and you're about to be attacked from three different directions. You have about twenty-five milliseconds before the next beat hits and those attacks land. It's extraordinarily exhilarating, being put on the spot like this, and there's nothing more satisfying than fighting your way out of a chaotic melee without taking a scratch.That's the truly beautiful thing about Necrodancer's combat: it's almost always possible to handle a fight in such a way that you completely evade damage. Every enemy moves according to a certain pattern, some fairly simple, some much more obtuse, and the key to survival is to dance around them; to step nimbly out of reach on the beat before a scything attack, to dart in and strike while they're recoiling, to move warily around them until the perfect opportunity. Most of this is opportunistically played out in the heat of the moment, but there are certain combinations of moves you can memorise to deal with particular scenarios - if you’re boring, that is. You'll have to learn to dance on the fly too, at least if you plan to beat the game at some point, because Cadence is as fragile as a sheet of plate-glass being carried across a busy road, which I suppose is inevitable when you go out on an adventure in your gardening gear. In the very first level of the very first zone, there are certain enemies that can kill you in a single hit, and it only gets harder from there. Initially it feels ruthlessly unfair, punishing you needlessly for even the slightest slip-up, but as you learn enemy patterns and weapon behaviours, it smooths out into a more reasonable - but still, of course, exceptionally challenging - experience. It's a brand of difficulty that will seem very familiar to any seasoned Spelunky player, in the sense that death is always avoidable but nevertheless entirely to be expected, and first and foremost your fault. Oh, it may be down to a matter of ignorance sometimes, but the learning experience is all part of the fun.And since I feel obliged to put good design on a pedestal whenever I see it, let’s appreciate for a moment the way a large amount of Necrodancer’s upgrades affect you in ways other than boring stat boosts. If it was just a case of sharper swords or shinier armour then Necrodancer would still be great, if a little homogeneous, but so many upgrades are specifically engineered to force you to change how you think spatially; boots that leap two spaces at a time, weapons that lunge forward or knock enemies back, spells that only hit specific squares, a drum that lets you stand still for a beat, and so on. It’s brilliant, not necessarily for throwing in extra complications but for throwing in the kinds of extra complications that you can solve at a glance, provided you realise what they entail. You’ll die countless times because you forget about these little modifiers, stopping to attack by accident or lunging in front of a runaway bus, but with sufficient practice they can be managed with the kind of immediacy that doing elaborate mental maths could never achieve.Speaking of forgetting things, I really do wish there was some indication on your character - difficult, given the level of detail we’re working with, but probably not impossible - as to the usable items you currently have equipped; when you can’t take your eyes off the dance floor for minutes at a time, it’s easy to forget that they’re there. The game helps a little bit with its UI design, but I still find a vast number of my runs end with me staring at the ‘game over’ screen, realising that I could have made it out alive if I’d just remembered I was capable of casting the Deus Ex Machina spell. Still, at least I knew what the Deus Ex Machina spell did when I picked it up. That’s one nice feature that sets Necrodancer apart from a lot of other roguelikes and usually goes unappreciated: you can actually play it without constantly diving into the codex or having the wiki permanently open on your other monitor. Moving next to an item will momentarily show a description of its functionality - often a proper concise description too, not the cryptic nonsense that Binding of Isaac teases you with - and while the input combinations for activating equipment aren’t always intuitive, the game does have the decency to spell them out for you as part of the UI. Some item descriptions are still a bit obtuse or simply consist of “???”, but I suppose it can’t hurt to have a bit of an air of mystery here and there.",

Crypt of the NecroDancer — удивительная смесь ритм-игры и рогалика. В игре все движется на основе музыкальных ритмов. Ритмы к Crypt of the NecroDancer написал знаменитый композитор Дэнни Барановски, знакомый многим по музыке из Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Isaac, Desktop Dungeons. Проект представляет собой двухмерную бродилку с видом сверху, которую можно проходить с использованием клавиатуры и контроллера. Самый интересный момент геймплея — ваш текущий набор из перемещений и боевых навыков жестко привязан к темпу проигрывающейся музыки (саундтрека). Чем дальше вы продвигаетесь и чем большего прогресса добиваетесь, тем быстрее становится темп. Далее — сами враги тоже учитывают музыку и действуют в соответствии с ней. Скажем, синеватые пузыри-поглотители прыгают по клеточкам и замирают между отдельными ударами. А зеленые пузыри — бегают из стороны сторону! Среди других врагов можно назвать таких каноничных пещерных обитателей, как пещерные летучие мыши, каменные големы и змеи. Стратегия ведения боя требует от геймера чуткого слуха и умение чувствовать ритм. В противном случае прохождение будет казаться архаичным и нелепым. Кроме ударов вы можете использовать набор из трех заклинаний: лечащее, которое восстанавливает 1 сердечко ХП; замораживающее, которое заставляет всех противников застыть на экране; огненное, летящее по горизонтали и зачищающее определенную область от нечисти!Crypt-of-the-NecroDancer-MULTi6-PROPHET.torrentproudly announcesCrypt of the NecroDancer (c) Brace Yourself Gamesrelease date: October 2768protection: Steam# of discs: 1languages: EN/FR/DE/IT/ES/JPCrypt of the NecroDancer is an award winninghardcore roguelike rhythm game.

      "Invisible, Inc. is a turn-based tactics stealth video game incorporating elements of roguelike gameplay, developed by Canadian independent studio Klei Entertainment. In the game, the player acts as the remote operator for an espionage agency that has come under attack from multinational corporations, and directs agents in covert missions, acquiring resources and support in order to enable relocation of the agency's computer system to a safe haven within a limited amount of time.\nThe game was available for Early Access for Microsoft Windows and OS X from January 2014, a Linux build was later released. The full version was released for Windows, OS X, and Linux on May 12, 2015. A PlayStation 4 version was released on April 19, 2016, while a version for iOS devices was released on October 6, 2016.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game is a turn-based tactics based-game inspired by X-COM, with emphasis on stealth and espionage. In each playthrough, the player takes on the role of an agent handler for covert operations and has three days to prepare for their final mission. This is done by performing various missions across the globe to retrieve information, valuables, equipment and personnel, keeping cognizant of the amount of time taken for travel and missions within that three day period. The player selects two agents to perform these missions to start, and may be able to free other agents during missions; should one agent die during a mission, they remain dead for the remainder of the runthrough unless dragged to the exit by another agent, while if all agents die, the game is over. The mission details and location layouts are procedurally generated for each run through, featuring a variety of objectives, obstacles, and difficulty.\n\nMissions are played out in a turn-based manner. Each agent under the player's control has a limited number of action points each turn that allow them to move, open/close doors, take out guards silently, or perform other covert tasks. Additionally, the player may need to collect power to be able to use \"Incognita\", the hacking interface that allows them to disable alarms and security cameras or remove locks on safes. Once the player has completed their turn, any enemy forces move, and in most locations an alarm level is raised; with higher alarm levels, new security forces and threats will arrive, making the mission more difficult. Certain stations can let the player purchase upgrades or equipment for the agents to help in the mission, using collected in-game money. The objective of the mission depends on the facility type being infiltrated, usually requiring the player to retrieve a specific item from a secure location and escape, stealing as much money and equipment as possible along the way.\nThe game has a larger meta-game aspect, in that as they play and complete certain goals, they can unlock different agents with different skill sets or new default equipment to begin missions with in future playthroughs.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game is set in year 2074, after megacorporations have overthrown the world's national governments and taken control. Invisible Inc. is a private intelligence agency providing services to corporations, performing infiltrations using field agents and a sophisticated AI system known as Incognita.\nAt the start of the game, Invisible Inc. is compromised, which leads to the headquarters as well as most agents and assets being lost, with only the agency's leader, two agents, the player, Monst3r, and Incognita escaping. Incognita can only be hosted in extremely powerful computer systems and cannot survive outside of them for more than 72 hours, so it becomes the agency's task to use that time to prepare for their final mission, where they will try to infiltrate the enemy's headquarters to access the computer system and insert Incognita. But, when she becomes uploaded it turns out she has been planning to exterminate the megacorporations, and ends with her using satellites (equipped with orbital lasers) to destroy their headquarters, killing thousands of people in the process. Incognita defies her removal from the new host computer and allows the agency's leader to leave unharmed.\n\n\n== Development ==\nInvisible, Inc. was announced on July 2, 2013, in an interview with Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Nathan Grayson. A preview of the alpha version of the game was shown at the September PAX Prime 2013 expo. After playing the preview, Grayson commented that the game was very early in development, but that he \"really enjoyed\" his session with the game.The game was originally titled Incognita but was renamed to Invisible, Inc. after developer Klei Entertainment found the new title was better received during focus testing. The name remains as part of the game as \"Incognita\" mode used to interact with the various electronic systems.\nAn alpha version of the game entered Early Access in January 2014. The game was added to the Steam Early Access program on August 20, 2014, and fully released on May 12, 2015. The game was released on the PlayStation 4, including the Contingency Plan content, on April 19, 2016. An iOS version of the base game was released on October 6, 2016, with plans to bring the downloadable content later.Downloadable content (DLC) for the game, titled Invisible, Inc. Contingency Plan was released on November 12, 2015. The DLC adds new agents, mission difficulty levels, missions, enemy types, weapons and items to the main game, in addition to an extended campaign.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nInvisible, Inc. was named as a finalist for the Excellence in Design and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize for the 2015 Independent Games Festival.\nInvisible, Inc. received positive reviews upon release. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PC version of the game 82% based on 24 reviews and 82/100 based on 45 reviews. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

That paralyzer also comes in handy a lot.I'm leaning to Deckard and banks, but that Internationale remote access.....It helps when I can have three on a team....i always start with Banks/Deckard my self now once i unlocked her. that extra flexibility and sneaky of both the cloak and the doors really helps and saves inventory space. and now i don't have to sit on the damned guard to keep them stunned for a few more turns!I'm now using Banks and Deckard also, I like their great mobility but Internationale's wireless was really helpful too. Might try Internationale and Banks after that.Internationale and Banks - Really popular combinationStrategy of this combination l write in other topicI use the Parasite, so I never find myself needing to hack consoles to grab more power. Because of that I'm going to say Deckard and Banks. It took a bit to figure out how to use her, what with her lacking a unique trait that contributes to survival like the others, but being able to open those red doors without a keycard is all kinds of heavenly. Plus I just like the idea of the senior-most (21 years working for Incognita!) and the junior-most (a measly 1 year) agents kicking ass together.I can't wait to see how Klei's going to bring back those other two agents, what with everyone having something that makes them unique.I originally ran with Banks and Internationale, but once I started using parasite/fusion (I usually get lockpicking early to offset this surplus) I dropped Internationale. I replaced her with Deckard for a while but now I'm trying out Shalem. With a particular aug, Shalem's rifle can handle anything (though I usually only start killing later) and give him a hi velocity dart gun to go along with that and he makes for quite the backup plan. Deckard is usually a good third agent to rescue, but unfortunately I see no benefit with Internationale with the para/fusion combo I'm running at the moment.I think I will go with Shalem 11 and Internationale. Internationale is a must for me, because her ability to see and hack through walls has no equal. Shallem 11, because he starts with a good weapon that has two bullets in it per mag on top of being able to pierce armor. Add an aug that ignores heart monitor to this and he can kill with no fear at all.But until the end when cost doesn't matter much, the cleanup penalty adds up for those first couple of days if you kill many guards. It's not fear I have problems with on Shalem 11 but early costs.You don't have to kill guards, but it's better to pay for the cleanup and keep agent(s) alive if need be. I'd rather have a weapon I don't need to use rather than not have it and need it. It saved my skin a couple of times when I started with this setup.Where do you think the rest of 11's ammo wentBack on topic though, I change my opinion almost every playthrough.Deckard's cloak and starting movement bonus makes him a great complement to any partner, giving the team an extra edge in mobility and a nice \"trump card\" for getting past a well-placed guard and taking them down when other options don't work.Internationale's abilities make her a good counter-balance against the usual need for mobility. She can access consoles guarded by turrets when no other agent could, she can find cameras in places other agents can't reach without being seen, and in some cases, can confirm a LACK of need to explore somewhere another agent would risk more to investigate.Shalem 11 has extra inventory space, which is a minor advantage at the beginning. He relies heavily on the rifle being a major trump card. If I don't have him on my team, and find a well-placed armoured guard in my first few missions, I frequently find myself wishing for the simplicity that rifle provides. While it comes with drawbacks, the ability to essentially remove any need to juggle KO timers and cooldowns on one of your guards is HUGE. So is the ability to take down 3 enemies on consecutive turns (2 gunshots, 1 melee) with one agent. Where Deckard's cloak lets you salvage a situation as it's starting to fall apart, Shalem's gun lets you wait until the last second and turn a fail state back to your advantage.Banks is also great to have around. Much like Internationale, her abilities allow you to reduce the need for extra speed when exploring. You can stall the recovery on KOed guards, meaning more time to assess situations. You also get to easily pass through security doors, frequently finding shortcuts through areas where other characters would have to take the long way around.Deckard and Shalem both make it easy to progress through situations faster.Banks and Internationale make it less important to progress quite so fast.Deckard and Shalem provide counters to sticky situations.Banks and Internationale avoid getting into those situations.(btw are there Shalems 1-10 ? )I always played with Deckard / Internationale, will play a bit with Deckard / Shalem, hopefully I can go further with this combination.Deckard and Banks as the starting team for me!Deckard's extra APs make a huge difference in early stage from my experience, I never seem to work well with Internationale and Banks at the beginning.After that I prefer to get Internationale for her wireless scan ability.In the story mode i play Deckard and Internationale because of Deckard's high obilty and cloak ind the early days and International's ability to hack consoles through walls, so i do't need to waste the AP of my agents for consoles. They have a great impact in the first 2 days. The problem is that they both need some equipment for day 3 and 4, but it should be possible to get one decent gun and a better neural disruptor.In the endless mode i prefer Shalem 11 and Banks. Shalem is weak in the eraly days because of his salvage disruptor, but banks comepensate this with her abilities to open every door. The big advantage is that you get a great rifle for free and with 2 augmentations on Shalem 11, the difficulty of extremly and heavily guarded mission decreases. So you can survive with enough ammo (safes, consoles, nanofab) many days... until you do a big mistake.I'm new to Invisible Inc so naturally I'm prone to making stupid mistakes that alert a guard with a gun ready to kill me if I make a move in any direction. So I tend to use Shalem, when I do alert a guard by mistake I play the western style quick draw shoot out game. Shallem has never lostAlong with Shalem I use Internationale so I can save AP and hack those nodes from afar for AP.Banks is pretty awesome too with here paralysing injection. So I tend to swap Internationale out for her when I need to restart. The good thing about this game is that you can find and use all 4 agents through in game missions, pretty early on.I wonder if Klei will add more agents and thus make our initial choices harder seeing as the limit is 4 and we are never sure which agent we find during the missions.Shalem11 / BanksShalem is my killer, banks my door openerWelcome to the party! Yes we will have up to 6 agents to select from with our four agent pool being max. Thank you Twitch stream!I'm new to Invisible Inc so naturally I'm prone to making stupid mistakes that alert a guard with a gun ready to kill me if I make a move in any direction.

I usually don't kill people of a lot in story mode. In endless mode, I am on day 31.  I kill the guards as fast as possible. This makes it much easier to move. Of course first I explore the whole map to see which guards are the most annoying. Shalems rifle is very powerful combined with additional armor piercing and the argumentation that doesn't raise the tracker when you kill someone. You can also sort of stack ammo in the inventory so you never run out of it. But it comes with a price.  the inventory must be full so he can't pick up any new items.I don't need international since I play with fusion parasite dagger and oracle. Plus I use portable server 3. This gives me endless pwr. I only hack consoles for reducing the tracker and sometimes more ap,  money or ammo. Depending on the situation.Internacionale and Banks 5everTrying out Shalem 11 and Banks and liking that combination as well. I used to love Deckard because more Ap is OP but I found that I didn't used him to full pontecial because rarely used his very useful coat.I prefer Banks and Internationale, because knowledge and mobility is power, and yes I mean actual PWR   I have found that I rarely if ever use consoles unless it's a dire situation, but Internationale's wireless scan makes her invaluable to me personally.  It makes parasite stronger, which I tend to use.I like banks because I don't want to have to wait to explore or open options.  Also she is a godsend on any pure stealth/no weapons runs because of her added mobility through opening locked doors.That being said, I value Shalem11's gun close to $1,100 which is a lot you could spend on other things, andDeckard is another amazingly versatile character similar to Banks/Internationale, I just value the others a bit higher for their situation improvement kits.When playing B&I, what Incognita programs do you start with?I prefer Banks and Internationale, because knowledge and mobility is power, and yes I mean actual PWR   I have found that I rarely if ever use consoles unless it's a dire situation, but Internationale's wireless scan makes her invaluable to me personally.  It makes parasite stronger, which I tend to use.I like banks because I don't want to have to wait to explore or open options.  Also she is a godsend on any pure stealth/no weapons runs because of her added mobility through opening locked doors.That being said, I value Shalem11's gun close to $1,100 which is a lot you could spend on other things, andDeckard is another amazingly versatile character similar to Banks/Internationale, I just value the others a bit higher for their situation improvement kits.Powered by Invision Community",

      "The 2001 remake of Ocean’s Eleven left me confused, enthralled, and feeling the need to upgrade my threads. This is the goal for most heist movies: the audience should be as dazzled as the in-film mark, hoodwinked but with begrudging respect. The missteps should be uncloaked as part of the plan all along, with every twist meticulously reflected in the quick cuts and unexpected reveals.Spy films are more methodical. At least, the ones that draw from actual spooks are, as opposed to action movies merely fitted with espionage (your James Bonds and Ethan Hunts, for example). Real world intelligence-gathering is low-key by design and necessity; if there are gunshots and explosions then people will notice, and the last thing an intelligence officer wants is undue attention. Thus, films like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy are couched in stairwells and drawing rooms with coded conversations that no one in or out of the film should trust as truth. The Americans are playing the long game, scheming and counter-planning, getting dirty only when necessary.Invisible, Inc. captures the thrill and tension of a spy movie in a custom heist-film tuxedo. Developed by Klei (who, in the interest of full disclosure, employs former Kill Screen editor Chris Dahlen) and now officially released after a successful early access period, every mission of this game drops you in the soup with few skills, fewer friends, and no plan. These are all vital elements to successful corporate intrusion, and you’ll pick them up as you go along, but you’ll never be over-prepared. There’s no danger in having the upper hand, and in this game the charge comes from wiggling out of tight spots. Many of those pickles will be of your own design.At its foundation, Invisible, Inc. marries hide-and-seek stealth with the traditions of current roguelikes, including random level generation and a lack of a quick reset option. This game shines at the higher difficulties, because the consequences are legit and every step carries that much more weight. Mistakes must be lived with, which puts success on a spectrum: Getting through a level undetected feels good, but doing so by the seat of your pants after wrangling out of a royal fuck-up is a rush. Invisible, Inc. blends Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy Tactics, but you are forced to reckon with your own failure. It’s the planning and execution montage splayed out by the second, with no safety net, bubbling with the anxiety of strategies overwrought and ad-hoc.As the player, you’re an offsite operator for a team of spies looking to settle up with the coalition of mega-corps that torched your headquarters. The art direction is fantastically sharp, fluid, and moody, with charming voice work and pithy sound effects that do not wear out their welcome. It has the feel of a John le Carré novel set in the world of Blade Runner, visually if not plot-wise. The narrative is a bit thin but it’s ok, a knotty political thriller isn’t promised and therefore not missed. Invisible, Inc. is a quiet but intricate game meant to be parsed and read through the playing, one that steps back when you want to think and forward when plans get hectic.You need to do the slow, methodical work of undercover stealth: Peek through doors and hack cameras to see what’s going on, avoid guards rather than confronting them for as long as possible. A knocked out soldier soon wakes up angry and a dead one instantly raises the alarm, which already rises turn by turn and jumps up every time you’re spotted. But since Invisible, Inc. is turn-based, you can take your time figuring out your paths and winding through the blind spots, rushing only when tactically feasible, passing or raiding vaults and safes as the situation permits. Pressure rises as you wait to figure out sentry paths and find your target and escape routes, so while you can consider your move for as long as you’d like, you can’t just stroll through the blind spots at a leisurely pace.As is the nature of random generation, sometimes the level is stacked against you; the fun comes from dealing with a bum hand. Invisible, Inc. demands the player transcend their own expectations. Yes, occasionally an elite unit will be patrolling right in front of the teleporter out of Dodge, so you can’t drag your unconscious teammate through without getting shot. Meanwhile the other guards you put to bed are shaking it off and breaking patrol to find you. But you’re out of backsies, so while it wasn’t pretty, you figured out how to sell a taser for some med gel to get Deckard on his feet, and you all zipped past the final patrol before he turned around. Any heist you can stroll away from is a successful one, and the game rarely disallows for creative thinking.It’s sublime when a plan comes together, but squirming out of a nasty mess takes a higher degree of patience and pressurized innovation. Anyone can play a map enough to have near-omniscience on a level’s layout and just waltz through with nary an eyebrow raised. Invisible, Inc. doesn’t deny you this experience at the beginner level, but it’s more rewarding when played without a net (and it also allows you to customize challenges if you truly can’t deal with an anxiety-inflating alarm, for example). Play spy and nimbly case the joint, then follow up as a hard-knocking crew left to bungle your best laid schemes and tango with the consequences.",
      "By\nNick Capozzoli\n2015-05-14T06:11:29.133ZReviewEngrossing tension between empowerment and disempowerment, greed and fear, across an eminently replayable system.The spy movie, as the critic Brian Phillips pointed out a few years back, is at its heart a fantasy about tourism. The spy skips all the fussy details of travel—the discomfit, the bewilderment, the checked baggage restrictions—and cuts right to the landmarks. They know all the roads intuitively; they’re always fluent in the language. And if the spy of popular media is a fantasy tourist, then the hacker is a virtual one: ducking through the back alleys of cyberspace and turning the enemy’s tools against them with engineering jiu-jitsu. They never miss a semicolon, or spend an hour refreshing Stack Overflow.For the elite hacker-spies of Invisible, Inc., the act is so ironed out that it’s almost frictionless. They beam straight into the inner sanctums of evil zaibatsus like they came directly from the USS Enterprise. Another button press, and they’re in the network wreaking havoc—assuming control of computer terminals, surveillance cameras, and security drones. It all feels too effortless, at first, as your agents trade off turns with the enemy guards, spending action points to sneak around and override their systems. And then a momentary lapse forces your hand and you kill a guard, which raises the alarm level, which activates a new camera, which catches one of your characters dead to rights, resulting in a miniature fox hunt that sends the alarm level even higher, calling in heavier armored guards right next to your first character, who just used their last bullet to kill that first guard, and you know what? Let’s just hit the rewind button before this gets really out of hand.It all starts when the Invisible crew is raided by a global trust of militarized megacorps. The team is scattered and shaken, but sets about clambering back into the fight with the help of an omniscient artificial intelligence named Incognita. Incognita can only function on backup power for 72 hours (or whatever time is pre-specified in the exhaustively customizable options menu), so the agents go on a global pillaging campaign, swiping as many corporate assets as they can, culminating in a grand coup d’mainframe to reinstate their AI.Enter, the spy-as-tourist. Prospective missions crop up on a world map a-la XCOM: Enemy Unknown, offering varied rewards in exchange for time against Incognita’s countdown. Do you shlep all the way to eastern Russia for a difficult rescue mission, knowing it will cost you twelve (scaled down) hours? Or do you plow through a string of Mediterranean headquarters nearby that promise lightly guarded cash, weapon caches, and powerful cybernetic implants? It sounds quaintly romantic—abstracted as it is—the cyber spies globetrotting in their personal jet, collecting gadgets.But the spies are also hackers, and hackers are fettered to the tools of their trade. Nobody hides their server farms at the Eiffel Tower or the Taj Mahal. Consequently, a given level in Invisible, Inc. looks about the same as any other: a warren of grid-based conference rooms floating in a void, whether in Dublin or Dubai. The utilitarian surroundings spoil some of the fantasy—imagine Neo never escaping The Matrix, doomed to crouch-run between cubicles in perpetuity.The modular design does serve an end, however. Invisible, Inc.’s levels are procedurally generated, shuffling up hallways, security, objectives, and extraction points so that no two playthroughs are alike. The resulting unpredictability buoys the game’s stealth, dissuading players from the rote memorization that’s always been anathema to the genre. Take the previous hypothetical, with its exponentially increasing comedy of disasters. It might have been avoided, had I saved a single action point on my turn so my character could “peek” through a door prior to throwing it open. Even spotted, there’s a saving chance to hop to an immediately adjacent tile if it breaks line of sight. Or I might dive another character towards a nearby terminal and siphon some power, which can be used to turn a turret that will kill the guard. The gambit might pay off, but it also might cause delays or unforeseen complications that cause me to miss out on a chance at the enemy’s vault, or even lose two agents instead of one. Or maybe I burn a precious “rewind” chance to reset the turn and try a new permutation?Risk and reward are gauged, then a door opens, a new variable walks in, and they have to be gauged anew. Many of these variables are ushered in by the alarm system, which begins ticking up from the first turn—even if the player remains undetected. After a few turns, or an unstealthy blunder, the alarm ratchets up, introducing new layers of security on enemy electronics and additional patrols, or even broadcasting the location of the player’s agents. The effect’s a bit like having a downward slope underfoot—you might be able to ignore it, but if you trip, you’re going to roll for a while.On anything but Beginner, Invisible, Inc. poses a steep challenge, and any given run through the campaign can come crashing to a halt if things suddenly get out of hand like that. When it happens, almost everything’s lost for good, in the spirit of a roguelike (save files even wipe upon completion of the campaign). But a few abilities remain, like the ones which govern Incognita’s hacking abilities, and accumulated cash is banked towards new agents, many of whom completely upend the manner of play. “Internationale,” for example, can remotely activate the terminals that power up Incognita’s hacking interface, even from behind walls. That’s the power problem solved, almost singlehandedly. I find it hard to go without her.They’re a captivating rogues’ gallery, with the elegantly tapered musculature and Easter Island heads that Klei favors, and wonderfully haughty, disinterested British accents. Of Decker, a noir Blade Runner in a trenchcoat, Central, the M of the group says, “The 20th century thing is an unfortunate affectation,” affecting dame Judy Dench’s Bond matriarch in the process. It’s a pity that they rarely speak, and outside of Central, Incognita, and a rogue merchant named—ugh—”Monst3r,” they have little bearing on the terse plot that strings the procedurally generated levels together. I’d have liked a chance to know them better, beyond the rap sheets we’re given.“Isn’t that why we travel in the first place … how we’re able to know each other at all?” Phillips poses, and, “to be a tourist is to be a spy with his cover blown.” The great success of Invisible, Inc. is that it uses that prospect like a lingering tension. A wall hides an inconvenient guard, a firewall hides a malicious script, and suddenly the plans have changed, and it’s no longer possible to be a dispassionate spy, memorizing patrol routes and waiting out alarms. The team is strung out, the guards are closing in, the plane is leaving. Who makes it?What is it? A turn-based stealth strategy game with a cyberpunk spin.

      "A few months ago, Klei Entertainment released Invisible Inc., the result of combining mind-boggling XCOM-like turn-based mechanics, and the jittery feeling of sneaking past guards of Mark of the Ninja. I played it, I reviewed it, and I loved it — albeit its disengaging characters and lack of sense of progression. It juggles with the discrepancy between the need to invest in your characters throughout the campaign, and the futility of such investment, as they can die at any moment and force you restart the campaign from zero. No moves can be undone within a turn, and repeating a turn comes at a high cost. This is why the game is better relished in low difficulties, where one wrong move in the later levels doesn’t entail the loss of many hours of progress. It isn’t only a game where the mechanics were the focus, but also its story, which meant that its roguelike design may not be the friendliest approach — as a side note, maybe a look at Zombi’s attitude towards permadeath would be appropriate here, which merges the orthodox approach to narrative with concepts seen in roguelikes.But the past is the past, and now Klei intends to pump some life into their game, and they’re doing so by turning everything up to eleven. Contingency Plan brings about more agents, more enemies, more gadgets, weapons, alarm levels, longer campaign, side missions… It is difficult to not see this as a desperate strife to enhance the game’s lifespan, and one that doesn’t succeed in all aspects. This move comes from the same developers that just announced their second expansion for Don’t Starve; one that, much like the first one did, is expected to give new twists and turns to the game’s universe and mechanics. Not only that, but they went through the hassle of forging a multiplayer version of that game, dubbed Don’t Starve Together.We can recognise that their reputation precedes them, and unfortunately, Contingency Plan doesn’t meet the expectations. Unquestionably, a game based around gathering and crafting like Don’t Starve can be more versatile when it comes to creating new content, but this doesn’t hold up as an excuse for such a categorically shallow DLC. Let me be clear about this: the new content lets me have my druthers in the same way I can add both Oreo and Kit Kat to my XL fro-yo for 50p more. It is not a caramel-flavoured yogurt, or a new set of Japanese sweets to add; it’s the ‘same-o, same-o’ we had before, over-cluttered with choices that become more and more pointless the more you take them in.One aspect I discussed in my review is the strange mix between permadeath and a narrative-driven game — the story is shite, yes, but there is some story —, and ironically, it is the one that suffers the most from Contingency Plan. It doubles up the length of the campaign up to 8 or 9 hours, increasing the difficulty of the missions accordingly. This transforms a rather demanding campaign to an extenuatingly laborious and utopian one. If the hardest difficulties were only achievable by those very dedicated players, now it’s become downright impossible for the common folk, as there are twice as many occasions to mess it up. What’s more, if you’re as bad as me, you’ll opt for the lowest difficulty, in which your agents are extremely overpowered and resourceful two thirds into the story. The last 3 hours of game are a repetitive chain of levels that widen the gap more and more between you and the enemy, and thus reducing the challenge.It seems to me that the main problem for this discrepancy in difficulties is the possibility of redoing a level, only available in the lowest. If an agent dies during a level, the game’s difficulty ramps up, whereas if you can redo the level, the agent will more likely make it out alive and with juicier upgrades. Adding more and more content just accentuates these differences. All in all, Contingency Plan doesn’t fix any issues or break the game; rather, it seems to be more catered to those proficient at it, and that can take that leap of difficulty and crave a bigger and longer challenge. More content is always appreciated, but to me, it became a bit superfluous and ‘too much’. However, I can acknowledge that it can either improve or worsen the game, depending on which end of the ‘Type of Player’ scale you stand. Personally, I just don’t have the patience.Contingency Plan doesn’t fix any issues or break the game; rather, it seems to be more catered to those proficient at it, and that can take that leap of difficulty and crave a bigger and longer challenge. More content is always appreciated, but here it becomes superfluous, as it adds no interesting twist to the gameplay..Jammy since birth, not so much in videogames. I will rant if you let me.

      "Invisible, Inc. is a turn-based tactical game with a focus on stealthy gameplay. It was created by Klei Entertainment, the makers of Don't Starve and was originally released on Mac and Windows back in May of 2015. It finally made the leap to iOS this month and was well worth the wait.THE PLOTThe game is set in the year 2074 after a host of too-big-to-fail mega-corporations have done away with national governments and taken direct control of the world's affairs. These corporations have immense assets and armies of security. Invisible, Inc. on the other hand is an intelligence and espionage agency and the game's namesake. It has attracted the ire of the corporate hegemony which took the nearly unprecedented step of pooling assets to put an end to the agency. The game starts as the Invisible Inc. headquarters is being overrun, most of its agents killed, and its assets seized or destroyed. All that remains is the agency's indomitable leader, two agents, a powerful computer AI known as Ingonita, and you.You play as a handler of covert operatives in the field. You must guide your two-agent team through a series of missions to build up the assets and experience necessary to infiltrate a corporate facility and implant Incognita in their computer systems. Apparently her housing in exile isn't up to snuff, and is kind of like putting a beluga whale in a coy pond. Bottom line: she will not survive more than 72 hours without an upgrade. There aren't many suitable locales, and the risk is worth the potential rewards for an agency with few options.If this all sounds a bit like the plot of all the Mission: Impossible movies, well, that's probably intentional. In fact, go ahead and queue up the M:I theme song to listen, it should serve as the perfect ambience for the rest of this review. The world and narrative may not be super original, but it doesn't have to be. It does a nice job of setting the stage and applying a sense of urgency to the overall campaign.THE GAME PLAYInvisible, Inc. is a turn-based game and uses action points (AP) for each of your agents much like in Templar Battleforce. The game is played on a grid where you have a birds-eye view of the corridors, rooms, doors, furniture and of course your agents. Moving one square on that grid costs one AP. Other actions, like peaking around a corner, also cost AP. Some actions, like opening or closing doors, do not cost any AP (quick tip: always close doors, it can take away security line of sight to your agents). You assign actions for your agents and then end your turn at which point the enemy takes its turn.Decision making is key in Invisible, Inc. and you have to decide the best path forward. There is no way you can force your way through missions and hack and slash enthusiasts need not apply. You need a good game plan and teamwork between agents, coordinated by you, their operator, is critical. As you encounter enemy security, for example, you have a choice: engage or evade. Your agents start with a neural disrupter, which can knockout a guard for a few turns, but when they come to they are on the alert and start seeking you out. Alternatively, you can attempt to sneak around guards. Sneaking in general is a ton of fun and I especially enjoy stealthing up right behind a guard and pickpocketing his access card and credits (the game's currency).Attacking is often unavoidable and ups the game's security level. Security level increases each turn as corporate security becomes aware of your presence. As the security level increases things become more difficult: firewalls get harder to break and additional security guards arrive to track down your agents.Agents have four different skills: Speed, Hacking, Strength, and Anarchy. Speed ties directly to how many action points the agent has. Action points are good the more you can do each turn the better. Hacking is also critical and is the ability to make use of Incognita to turn off security cameras, break through computer firewalls, and hijack computer terminals. When you access Incognito you flip to a different screen that provides a view of the electronic equipment within range with which you can tamper. Handily, it also shows you the position of security guards and is a pretty clear way to find the exit as well. Hacking costs power and you gain power at the beginning of each turn or by hijacking an enemy computer terminal.Strength affects the agent's ability to drag around unconscious guards and carry more items on their person. The latter becomes pretty handy when a mission objective is to recover stuff. Anarchy is all about the ability to pickpocket guards. The better you are at it, the more of their credits you can pilfer.There are five different levels of aptitude for each skill and your agents will start out with areas of speciality. As you play, you're able to level up agent skills using credits. You steal credits from the corporations and their security personnel. Credits can also be used to buy new and better tech (weapons, equipment, augmentations, etc.).  Improving agents and dropping them into the next job is really fun, and Invisible Inc. definitely has the \"just one more mission\" thing going for it as a result.The pacing of Invisible, Inc. is excellent and once you get the hang of it you can move quickly through turns. The speed-of-play dovetails nicely into the urgency of the overall narrative. In each mission you have a primary objective. It might be to find important information or steal an object of great value. It might be to rescue an important captive or just steal some credits. The objective drives your game plan, but even once you've secured your primary objective getting out alive is often the most difficult, and most fun, part of a mission. Things can go sideways in a hurry and staying one or two rooms ahead of the pursuit and narrowly escaping a tough spot provides a huge thrill.These thrills are frequent as the game is plenty challenging. For this review, I played on the \"beginner\" setting and had my hands full until I got a better handle on things. I got to the point where I felt like I could up the ante on the difficulty and have little doubt the higher settings will provide an appropriate challenge for any player.THE VERDICTInvisible, Inc. is well designed, looks great, and plays even better. It is fast-paced and exciting with a tightly woven, if fairly familiar, narrative. If you loved XCOM and Templar Battleforce you'll love this game. If you are a fan of turn-based tactical games this is absolutely in your wheelhouse. If you dig high-tech, high-stealth, full-of-thrills gameplay go buy this now on iOS.A super stealthy, strategy game-of-the-year contender.\"Log in to join the discussion.",

      "Invisible, Inc, is a turn-based, tactical stealth & espionage strategy game with a stylish Sci-Fi noir flair from Klei Entertainment, the makers of Don't Starve. Keep in mind that there might be some annoying and pesky guards around the corner, super laser beams blocking your way, highly intelligent AI, Big Brother on Overwatch, and locked doors between you and your target. So put together a plan, and some careful movement and deceptive trickery, and you just might be able to survive and escape with your trophy in tow.Note that Invisible, Inc. is currently in Early Access, which means that they are still in the beginning stages of development. At this time, they have the core mechanic of turn-based espionage, but the major features and content of the game are still being implemented. They expect the game to change significantly as they test and release new updates, and as much as they try to keep them out, they're expecting bugs along the way. And remember; Invisible, Inc isn't about clearing your opponent from the board."

      "There´s a lot of awesome Hack and slash RPG´s out there. So if you´re making a game like that. Then it better be really good. Or else you´re just going to end up in the shadows of the bigger names on the market. But i tried to play Phigames and Digital Tribe Games Hack n slash/RPG/roguelike game “TinyKeep” with an open mind.Well, “TinyKeep” started of pretty well. As i got rather impressed by the games graphics (the rag doll physics are pretty hilarious), humor and really talented voice actors. But things went down hill after that.And please allow me to explain why. The whole thought behind “TinyKeep” is that you (a prisoner) will try to breakout of a prison. And each and every stage is randomly generated.That´s nice right? Well, yeah. But here´s the thing. The pattern is pretty much the same throughout the game. And even though you get to pick your own hero at the very start of the game (gender, cloths ect). There´s not all that much room for customizing a unique and creative hero. And to my knowledge, there´s not all that many weapons or armors either.I can´t say that i enjoyed the fighting style either. As it´s very repetitive and boring for most part. Then we got the most annoying feature of “TinyKeep”. Which would be the fact that there´s no save function (IF Phigames haven´t changed that) in “TinyKeep”. So if you die, then you will have to start all over from the very first level of the game.And that becomes a huge problem further on in the game. As the difficulty setting becomes almost impossible after stage 5. Imagine yourself playing L4D2 on the hardest difficulty, and you get wave after wave of infected and special infected coming your way. But all you got is a lousy gun.Because everyone and everything is out to get you in “TinyKeep”. And once you reached stage 5, the bosses has become almost impossible to kill (or even to keep your distance from). And if you just make one single wrong move, then you´re history! Oh, did i mention that there´s booby traps everywhere?Then we got the somewhat inflexible map function on top of that (it´s not as flexible as the Diablo map for example). The part about spending coins for random upgrades wasn´t my cup of tea either. I did however enjoy playing with fire in “TinyKeep”.But sadly enough, that warming pleasure alone couldn´t save “TinyKeep” from a mediocre grade from me/us. You don´t have to take my word on it though, just watch our gameplay series of “TinyKeep” (you will find part 1 down below!) and judge for yourselfs.Pros:\n+ Great graphics\n+ Talented voice actors\n+ The dark humorCons:\n– No save function (if you day, you have to start all over from the very beginning)\n– The difficulty setting becomes almost impossible after stage 5\n– There´s not that many different weapons or armors\n– The map function is somewhat unflexibleVerdict: 2.5/5\nTinyKeep is not a all through bad  game. But it´s not an really good game either. And there´s plenty of better games in the same genre to choose from as well.Title: TinyKeep \nDeveloper: Phigames\nFormat: PC\nGenre: Action/RPG/Adventure/Hack and slash\nResolution: Highest possible on PC\nRelease date: 2014-09-29\nDifficulty:  Normal\nSpent time: 10+ hours\nAverage grade internationally: 55% Gamerankings.com\nPEGI age rating: 12+\nPrice: 11,99 Euro via SteamRobin “V-Act” Ek\nThe Gaming Ground\nTwitter: @TheGamingGroundMore by  Robin Ek:Tags: Action RPG, Digital Tribe Games, PC review, Phigames, The TinykeepThere´s no end to the on coming hordes of monsters in TinyKeep.

      "To begin with it should be noted that nowadays, everybody knows what a video game is. As a fact, computers become an entire part of our lives and are almost in every family. As a result, children start to use computer before even know how to talk. Of course, computers are used for good purpose – to teach children read or solve math problems and so on. Unfortunately, the most of their time children spend if front of the computer monitors and devote their time to PC games. As a rule, arises the question: how does such situation is reflected on the psyche of the child? In my opinion this is a debate question and there are a lot of opinions concerning this issue. In this essay I would like to focus on video games violence and its effect on children.Many experts consider that today the fascination of some people, especially children in violent video games reaches the level of dependency. As a rule, psychologists call this process gambling. According to Jill Adams (2010), it can be said that there is a psychological portrait of gamer: a teenager, that is immersed in the virtual world and ignoring all external events, very often such child has not been adapted to life in real world. The first stage of addiction is easily reversible disorder. At first, child is simply fascinated by the “new toy”; this stage is characterized by the detriment to education and other businesses. He gradually becomes estranged from family and friends. As a rule, children on this stage hide from their parents how much time they spend in front of the computer. The second stage is characterized by the following symptoms: if a child is prohibited to use the computer, he experiences a feeling akin to “breaking” of a drug addict. The child may steal money to pay for the time that he spends in the internet club. As a rule, the child feels decreased efficiency, impaired attention, the emergence of obsessive thoughts, headaches, cramps in the eyes, insomnia and so on. The third stage is called social disadaptation. As a fact, on this stage the child is completely lives in the virtual world and considers that this is his real life and the real world is a fiction.Moreover, it should be noted that in their passion to video games, children prefer to play in violent video games with a lot of blood and aggression. So, why do children prefer not innocent logical games, but those in which there are uncovered violence, cruelty, murder and other activities related to the destruction and degradation? Answering this question it can be said that, as a fact, these games give the child opportunity to feel power. Violent video games can be characterized by feelings of superiority and omnipotence. As a rule, children do not have an opportunity to experience such feelings in the real world, where everyone is stronger than they are (parents, teachers, seniors and so on). In turn, violent video games give the child a possibility to immerse in the game, where he plays a role of powerful or almighty hero, and this is a chance to take revenge.According to Andrea Norcia (2010), over the past 30 years, leading institutions and experts in the field of psychiatry conducted over 1000 studies that encountered that exists firm connection between violence on TV or computer and aggressive behavior of children. In other words, watching violent programs or playing violent video games can lead to the emergence of aggressive feelings, reactions and inappropriate behavior of children. Moreover, the child that reviewing abusing surveillance of violent scenes, as a rule, becomes numb to violence in real life.It should be noted that scientists’ conclusions are confirmed by following facts. In 1997 three children were killed in a school in West Paducah. The attacker, Michael Kernel, was 14 years old. As it became known, a young man was fond of such violent games as DOOM, Quake and Mortal Combat. In 1999, in Littleton 12 students were murdered by two high school students Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. As a fact, they were constantly playing DOOM, as well as Duke Nukem 3D.It is believed that a particular problem has the role-playing computer games, i.e. games in which the player acts as prescribed by the story of a specific computer hero. According to Sumit Tathguru (2009), a study conducted by the Department of Psychology of Iowa State University found out that during the playing video game, children feel the process of “entering” in the game, and in clinical cases – the loss of individuality as a result of identification themselves with computer characters. Moreover, the survey has shown that violent video games cause a qualitatively different level of psychological dependence, in contrast to logical games or any kind of non-game computer activities. It should be noted that this dependency is the most powerful on the extent of its influence on the playing person.However, not all scientists blame violent computer games in all teenagers’ problems. Of course, there are quite innocent and good video games that not cause harm to children. As a fact, there are different video games and some of them help children to review their potential and logical thinking. Many games are even beneficial, because children develop useful skills and learn to find effective solutions in difficult situations. In principle, any passing the game from the beginning to the end is the real victory, and without any doubts is essential for normal child development. And the fact that children are aggressive can be explained not only by violent video games influence but also such factors as dysfunctional family situation, peer influence, availability of firearms, etc., according to Teresa McEntire (2009). Although, the negative effects of such hobbies as playing violent video games is obviously stimulate aggressiveness and spread the cult of violence among teenagers. The children, who often play video games, which contain elements of violence, as a rule, consider that violence is the most effective way of conflicts resolving. It can be said that cruelty scenes view leads to reduced ability of appropriate emotional response to brutality in general. As a fact, cruelty in video games makes perceive the world as a place where there is evil. In addition, there is a fear of becoming a victim of violence, causing a lack of trust towards others.Nevertheless, experts agree that adults can not simply deny children play video games. According to Anne Harding (2008), In the United States at the level of individual states have been numerous attempts to restrict the sale of violent video games that contain scenes of violence and sex. However, the producers of games have always been able to, through the courts, abolish restrictions as contrary to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech.To sum it up, it should be noted that nowadays violent video games contribute to the development of the less compliant, and short-tempered children’s hostility and aggression. Also, many studies encountered that exists firm connection between violence on video games and aggressive behavior of children. As a fact, violent video games contribute to feelings of superiority and omnipotence among children, because in the real world, children do not have an opportunity to experience such feelings. However, not all scientists blame in violent computer games in all teenagers’ problems. As a fact, there are different video games and some of them help children to review their potential and logical thinking. Many games are even beneficial, because the children develop useful skills and learn to find effective solutions in difficult situations.It can be said that today we live in an era when it is difficult to imagine the implementation of any action without a PC. Computer is not a monster, but it is very useful assistant in your everyday life. Moreover, I would like to say that such specialties as computer programmers and web-designers are the most demanded and highly paid nowadays. In my opinion, to prevent further violence distribution among children parents should try to ensure that computer does not replace family and friends for the child. I am convinced that by paying attention to the child, by asking him about his life, by spending more time with him, by simple taking care parents offer to the child alternative solution to spending time by playing video games.ReferencesAndrea Norcia (2010).

New styles and \r\n\t\t\t\tgenres appear. The development of a computer game demands the \r\n\t\t\t\twork and skills of quite a large group of people including \r\n\t\t\t\tprogrammers, graphic designers, sound designers, musicians, and \r\n\t\t\t\tother technicians. Modern video games contain a unique synthesis \r\n\t\t\t\tof 3D art, sound effects, real-life environment, people-like \r\n\t\t\t\tcharacters, architecture, artificial intelligence, dramatic \r\n\t\t\t\tperformances, music, storytelling, and interactivity (the \r\n\t\t\t\tability to communicate directly with a computer programme which \r\n\t\t\t\tdoes things in reaction to your actions).\n\nVideo game \r\n\t\t\t\tdevelopers have been accused of the depiction of graphic \r\n\t\t\t\tviolence, sexual themes, advergaming (a form of advertising in \r\n\t\t\t\tgames), consumption of drugs, alcohol or tobacco, bad language, \r\n\t\t\t\tpropaganda, or profanity in some games. Many games encourage \r\n\t\t\t\tviolent behavior, blur the difference \r\n\t\t\t\tbetween right and wrong and cause addiction. Some people say \r\n\t\t\t\tthat video and computer games make children unsociable and \r\n\t\t\t\tpassive. They are absorbed in games without speaking to each \r\n\t\t\t\tother for a long time. Children and teenagers who are fond of \r\n\t\t\t\tcomputer games are not interested in reading. Some researchers \r\n\t\t\t\tproclaim that playing computer games stunts brain growth. \r\n\t\t\t\tChildren can play for hours without eating, sleeping or \r\n\t\t\t\tlearning. They sit in front of the computer screen exercising \r\n\t\t\t\ttheir fingers instead of playing outside or training themselves \r\n\t\t\t\tphysically. That's why the levels of obesity among children and \r\n\t\t\t\tteenagers are rising. The vast majority of computer games are \r\n\t\t\t\tmade for male game players, but nowadays more and more games are \r\n\t\t\t\tproduced for girls and women. Small amount of young females play \r\n\t\t\t\taggressive games and it has a negative influence on their \r\n\t\t\t\tpsyche.\n\nBut video and \r\n\t\t\t\tcomputer games have advantages as well. Most games require a \r\n\t\t\t\tgreat deal of patience and focus from the player so video games \r\n\t\t\t\tmay even increase players' attention capacities. They may also \r\n\t\t\t\timprove a child's visual skills and develop coordination. \r\n\t\t\t\tCertain types of video games can improve gamers' dexterity as \r\n\t\t\t\twell as their ability to solve problems.\n\nVideo games are \r\n\t\t\t\tmeant not only for entertainment. Some video games are made for \r\n\t\t\t\tother reasons. Educational games attempt to teach players using \r\n\t\t\t\tthe game as a vehicle. They help children develop maths, reading \r\n\t\t\t\tskills and spelling through play. Computer games can promote the \r\n\t\t\t\tdevelopment of strategic thinking and planning skills. It has \r\n\t\t\t\tbeen noticed that gamers don't realize they are learning. So if \r\n\t\t\t\teducational games could be used at school, education would enjoy \r\n\t\t\t\tsignificant benefits.\r\n\t\t\t\tAll we should do is to control the playing, distribution, \r\n\t\t\t\tpurchase, or sale of video and computer games. Violent games \r\n\t\t\t\tmust be banned and the time of playing games should be strictly \r\n\t\t\t\tlimited. Instead of killing and injuring people the aim of the \r\n\t\t\t\tgame can be to save somebody or to make peace.\r\n \n\r\n\t\t\t\t \n\r\n\t\t\t\t \n\r\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1.

Many games encourage \r\n\t\t\t\tviolent behavior, blur the difference \r\n\t\t\t\tbetween right and wrong and cause addiction. Some people say \r\n\t\t\t\tthat video and computer games make children unsociable and \r\n\t\t\t\tpassive. They are absorbed in games without speaking to each \r\n\t\t\t\tother for a long time. Children and teenagers who are fond of \r\n\t\t\t\tcomputer games are not interested in reading. Some researchers \r\n\t\t\t\tproclaim that playing computer games stunts brain growth. \r\n\t\t\t\tChildren can play for hours without eating, sleeping or \r\n\t\t\t\tlearning. They sit in front of the computer screen exercising \r\n\t\t\t\ttheir fingers instead of playing outside or training themselves \r\n\t\t\t\tphysically. That's why the levels of obesity among children and \r\n\t\t\t\tteenagers are rising. The vast majority of computer games are \r\n\t\t\t\tmade for male game players, but nowadays more and more games are \r\n\t\t\t\tproduced for girls and women. Small amount of young females play \r\n\t\t\t\taggressive games and it has a negative influence on their \r\n\t\t\t\tpsyche.\n\nBut video and \r\n\t\t\t\tcomputer games have advantages as well. Most games require a \r\n\t\t\t\tgreat deal of patience and focus from the player so video games \r\n\t\t\t\tmay even increase players' attention capacities. They may also \r\n\t\t\t\timprove a child's visual skills and develop coordination. \r\n\t\t\t\tCertain types of video games can improve gamers' dexterity as \r\n\t\t\t\twell as their ability to solve problems.\n\nVideo games are \r\n\t\t\t\tmeant not only for entertainment. Some video games are made for \r\n\t\t\t\tother reasons. Educational games attempt to teach players using \r\n\t\t\t\tthe game as a vehicle. They help children develop maths, reading \r\n\t\t\t\tskills and spelling through play. Computer games can promote the \r\n\t\t\t\tdevelopment of strategic thinking and planning skills. It has \r\n\t\t\t\tbeen noticed that gamers don't realize they are learning. So if \r\n\t\t\t\teducational games could be used at school, education would enjoy \r\n\t\t\t\tsignificant benefits.\r\n\t\t\t\tAll we should do is to control the playing, distribution, \r\n\t\t\t\tpurchase, or sale of video and computer games. Violent games \r\n\t\t\t\tmust be banned and the time of playing games should be strictly \r\n\t\t\t\tlimited. Instead of killing and injuring people the aim of the \r\n\t\t\t\tgame can be to save somebody or to make peace.\r\n \n\r\n\t\t\t\t \n\r\n\t\t\t\t \n\r\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\r\n\t\t\t\t1.

We suggest you try the article list with no filter applied, to browse all available. Post article and help us achieve our mission of showcasing the best content from all developers. Join now to share your own content, we welcome creators and consumers alike and look forward to your comments.In case you haven't already noticed, today I'd like to make an official announcement that the Steam version of TinyKeep is now available for all three desktop platforms (PC Windows, MacOSX and Linux).Of course with it being a Unity game, porting to other platforms is a lot easier than it used to be. However it still isn't a one-click solution. Over the past month we ran into all sorts of issues from consistent game controller support, resolution issues, installation dependencies to compatibility problems with the latest Yosemite MacOSX update. Thus I'd like to thank everyone who offered to help test the game on a range of setups, without which it would have been very difficult to co-ordinate the release in time.I've promised Google and Nvidia that I'll do one final port (for the time being at least) to their Android tablet devices and then after that I'll be free to finish off some Kickstarter reward stuff. And then I will perhaps start exploring other avenues to get TinyKeep onto other more consumer based platforms. *cough* consoles *cough*Until next time!Version 1.2 is here, adding some much needed and heavily requested features as well as a load of bug fixes and gameplay tweaks.TinyKeep is now available to buy on Steam, and we have a full length extended trailer!So my composer Will Bedford dropped this into my inbox this morning, a fully mastered version of the soundtrack!We've finally begun the process of launching our game, first step: Teaser Trailer!I did a Let's Play/First impressions on this game! Come check it out if ya like!\nBig thanks to the developer for this great game!\nHope you enjoy.This looks absolutely wonderful, I better get a copy of TinyKeep this weekend. Is it possible to find out what artists you had on board making this game? I recently moved to the UK to persue a full time career in games, so I'm very curious to see what game devs in the UK are creating and see what direction the industry is heading in the UK.Awesome work. It's rare to see devs in Europe making handpainted styled games.Hey there, you may recognize a few of the assets from a company called BitGem, we ended up getting Bitgem's Matthias Andre (who's from Germany) to help us out with TinyKeep. The main player character was modelled and rigged by Zane Devon. Hope that helps! Whereabouts in the UK did you move to? We're based on North in Manchester :)Is there a demo available?Not at the moment, but I'll consider adding one in the future :)This looks super fun, if you'd like; we could review your game for you. Just message us on here or visit our website and submit your game there if you're interested.Paid, but no love. Helps!Sent, enjoy the build :)Ty sir, just got.Looking great guys :D!Your comment will be anonymous unless you join the community.

    "title": "Dungeon of the Endless",
    "text": [
      "Dungeon of the Endless is a roguelike, tower defense game developed by Amplitude Studios and released in October 2014 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X systems, August 2015 for iOS devices, and for Xbox One in March 2016. It is the third game of their loosely connected Endless series, which includes Endless Space and Endless Legend.\nIn the game, the player takes the role of the survivors of a prison spaceship, its escape pod having crashed to the surface of a strange planet. To escape, they must take an energy crystal through several floors, each floor filled with a number of dangerous creatures. To help, the player can have their survivors explore the randomly generated levels to collect resources as to enable power to various rooms and construct turrets to fend off the enemies when they move the crystal from its starting point to the elevator to the next floor.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDungeon of the Endless is a roguelike game, featuring procedurally generated levels and the notion of permadeath, so that each runthrough of the game is different. The game is based on directing the survivors of a prison spacecraft (crew, prisoners, and civilians alike), having crash-landed on a strange alien planet, through several levels as to achieve escape from the planet. At the start of each game, the player selects two characters with each character having different statistics such as health, attack, defense power, and movement speed, as well as a number of abilities. The player is able to control each character separately or in tandem by directing them to move to the various rooms on the current level or open doors on that level, as well as to initiate any special ability or to heal them. Otherwise, the characters will act autonomously such as fending off any enemies that enter the room to the best of their ability. On the first level of the game, the characters will start in the crashed escape pod with the power crystal, while on subsequent levels, they will start on the elevator that they took from the previous level.\nThe game plays out in primarily a turn-based manner, each turn marked when a new door on the level is opened. At the start of each turn, the player gains fixed amounts of three resources: Industry, Science, and Food. Industry is used primarily in the construction of turrets and resource generators; Science is used to research new types of turrets and generators, and Food is used to heal the characters, or increase their experience level which improves their statistics, and gives them new abilities. Certain rooms may have objects that can be scavenged for more of these resources. Furthermore, rooms will have Dust, which powers the crystal. As the crystal gains more power, the player can \"activate\" a limited number of continuous sets of rooms, allowing them to build resource generators and turrets on rooms which have been activated. Players can also deactivate a room at any time to reroute the power to a different room, disabling the turrets and generators in that room. Other rooms may feature item chests, shopkeepers, and research stations, or they may contain survivors that players can recruit to their party (up to 4 characters total).\nOpening a new door may also cause monsters to appear, appearing at random rooms across the map in any room that is not activated or lacking its own power source. The monsters will attack both the party and the crystal; killing the creatures has a chance of creating more Dust to run the crystal. The characters will lose health with attacks and will die if it drops to zero, though once all newly spawned monsters are defeated, their health is fully restored. If the crystal is attacked, it will permanently lose Dust, and if this drops to zero, the crystal is destroyed and the game is over. During monster attacks, the player can freely move the characters around between open rooms to obtain the best tactical placement, such as fighting monsters alongside numerous turrets. Once any spawned monsters are defeated, the player can move characters about and build defenses freely until they opt to open the next door.\nOnce the exit point on the level has been found, the player then must have one character collect the crystal and carry it slowly from the start to the exit point, while other characters protect the carrier from hordes of monsters that appear at this point. If the crystal carrier dies, the game is over, but if all surviving players make it to the room with the exit point, the player advances to the next level. The goal of the game is to complete 12 of these levels, each with more difficult monsters that appear, with at least one character carrying the crystal to the final exit point.\nA meta-game exists in that the player can unlock additional characters for starting the game by recruiting new characters they find on levels and either completing the game or three levels with that character alive. Additionally, by achieving certain goals, the player can unlock different gameplay modes, such as one where the characters will start off much stronger than the enemies but will not regain health once a monster wave is defeated, forcing them to rely on food, healing turrets or items to heal.\nThe game supports online play with up to four players.  Each player controls one character, and each gains separate resources on the opening of new doors. New characters can be recruited by one player if there is space in the party, which are then controlled by that player.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDungeon of the Endless was developed by Amplitude Studios alongside the development of their expected-flagship title Endless Legend; the team for Dungeon was kept small to about four to five people, and used a simple pixel-based art style to keep the project simple. Amplitude's co-founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis stated that while they were developing a deep, high-quality 4X-based game in Endless Legend, the concept of Dungeon came from \"some crazy drinking evening\", and instead of trying to approach the smaller title with crowdfunding, sought additional funding to support the title.Dungeon of the Endless was first released as an Early access title on the Steam software store on December 11, 2013, and the full version was released on October 27, 2014. An iOS version was also developed and released on August 20, 2015. The title was released for the Xbox One on March 16, 2016.A free Team Fortress 2 based expansion was added in June 2015 for personal computers, adding in characters and items based on Team Fortress 2. An expansion called \"Organic Matters\" was also released on November 24, 2015, which included new playable characters, monsters, additional modules that can be built, a new endgame sequence, and support for controllers, and a separate content pack called \"The Rescue Team\" featuring three new playable-characters.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDungeon of the Endless has received generally positive reviews, comparing the title to other hybrid roguelike such as FTL: Faster Than Light. Some have criticized the game for having low replay value, in that once you have succeeded to complete a runthrough of the game, you will likely have experienced all the hazards that the game presents, and while one can repeat the game with different characters to start, the experience will be mostly the same.The title was named as an honorable mention in the Excellence in Design category for the 2015 Independent Games Festival awards. It was also nominated for Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Game Design for the 18th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "By\nEmanuel Maiberg\n2014-10-28T22:00:00.3ZReviewDungeon of the Endless borrows from many games to create something new, and it's a fun challenge, even if there isn't much reason to beat it more than once.It's the eighth floor of Dungeon of the Endless, and with a full squad of four, well-equipped, level 6-7 characters, I have everything under control. I set up turrets next to the unpowered rooms where aliens could spawn whenever I open another door, securing a path between the crystal I need to protect and the elevator to the next floor. I send Sara Numas, a katana-wielding bounty hunter and the fastest character in the group, to open doors, then run back to the crystal room to fight off whatever I've unleashed with the rest of the group. By the time the aliens get past the defenses, they're weak, and we take them out easily.Then, of course, it all goes to hell. In my defense, I had no idea that if I spent enough time on a floor, the aliens will eventually bust through closed doors all by themselves and stream out in great numbers, but Dungeon of the Endless teaches all of its important lessons this way. It's a cruel, but entertaining learning experience.Its pause-at-any-time combat, desperate race to the finish, and strategies that forced me to cut off a limb to save the body reminded me of FTL, while its character upgrades, inventory, and squad management reminded of XCOM. And then there's the tower defense element, where each room has a set number of nodes where I could place turrets, healing units, and other useful gadgets.Dungeon of the Endless pulls from many popular games and genres from the last couple of years, but what's wonderful about it is that all these elements come together to create something entirely new.I start each run in an escape pod that crash lands on an alien planet. The only way out is up through 12 floors of an alien infested dungeon, and I have to bring the crystal with me to power my escape.Each stage has two phases. First I have to find the elevator to the next floor, opening one door at a time. Each time I open a door there's a chance I'll find aliens that will immediately attack my squad, defenses, or the crystal. If my entire squad or the crystal goes down, it’s game over. If I survive whatever happens after opening a door, I have infinite time to plan my next move.Dust, a resource that makes the crystal more powerful, lets me provide power to rooms, which ensures aliens don't spawn there, and activates the room's major and minor module slots. Major modules are mostly for gathering resources: Industry, which I need to build anything, Science for researching upgrades, and Food to heal and level up heroes. Minor modules house different kinds of turrets.I've seen all these turret types before in other tower defense games, but having a squad on the ground meaningfully recontextualizes that familiar gameplay. There are many different hero and module combinations to experiment with, and I'm much more invested in the characters I'm tower-defending because I customized them myself.For example, I gave Elise Ness, a freelance demolitionist in a giant space suit, a big machine gun that deals a lot of damage. With a healing module and another that boosts her attacks, she can protect a room by herself from most threats.I can heal heroes and activate up to two of their special abilities, but that's the full extent of direct combat controls. The trick is knowing what room to put the heroes in, and how to prepare those rooms in their favor. Once they're in there, they'll take care of the rest automatically.The only way to get Dust is by finding it in new rooms, but there's always less Dust than there are rooms, ensuring that a wave of aliens can spawn whenever I open a door. After finding the elevator, it's time for the second phase. I need to bring the crystal and the heroes to the elevator, but picking the crystal up will cause large waves of aliens to spawn in every unpowered room, and unlike waves in the first phase, they won't stop coming until we’re out of there, or dead. The most interesting choice at that point is what rooms to power up.My favorite method was to explore a floor until I had enough Dust to power a path between the crystal and next elevator, build as many turrets as I could along the way, and hope they slowed the aliens enough so I could get to the elevator before they caught up with me.It took me a couple of runs to realize that I couldn't just sprint through floors. Dungeon of the Endless' universe, which mixes space marines with walking skeletons and wooden chests, conveys a lot of dread with its dimly-lit but colorful, pixelated artstyle, and there are some really menacing aliens in the upper floors.Opening a door doesn't only give me a chance to find the loot I need to deal with them, but counts as a turn which collects resources from whatever major modules I've built. Do I make a run for the elevator now, when I know I have a fair shot of getting there, or do I take a chance and open another door? There's a lot of equipment, research, and upgrades to choose from in Dungeon of the Endless, but the game hinges on the decision to open a door, or not, and it was loaded with tension every single time for the eight hours I played it. There's no loading a previous save. It's a commitment.The other big question that kept me interested was if could make it to the top. It was challenging, and so far I've only been able to do it on the \"too easy\" mode, but once I did, I was pretty much done.Floor layouts are randomly generated, and I was always curious to discover all the little visual details in each new room. There are also new heroes to earn, and different escape pods, which tweak some of the basic rules and starting conditions of a run (like ships in FTL). Still, once I've survived one alien-infested, sci-fi/fantasy hybrid space dungeon, I've kind of survived them all. The aliens have a lot of nasty surprises, but they didn't force me to change up my strategy once I found one that works.It took me at least six tense hours to find that strategy, and for $13/£10, I can definitely recommend taking a ride on that elevator.What is it? A roguelike, tactical RPG, tower defense hybrid.

      "Seven years after release, Skyrim is still one of the most popular games in the world. Bethesda created a massive open-world game that gives even serious completionists a run for their money. Fans continue to develop incredible and hilarious mods, keeping players entertained and desirous for more.One invaluable source for modders is all the epic content Bethesda deleted from the game. Even though Bethesda began and abandoned numerous projects, they left many of those unfinished projects in the game’s hidden files. Most can be accessed via PC console commands, while only expert programmers can locate the rest.Most of the deleted content on this list is available through console commands. You can easily look up the command and see Bethesda’s unfinished work. However, most of this work has been completed by modders. If you like playing Skyrim with mods, I recommend checking out those mods for the most epic experience.In some cases, Bethesda left traces of deleted content in the final game. On this list, those traces are usually pieces of a deleted quest. Bethesda removed the quest itself, but they left items, NPC bodies, or dialogue that relate to the quest. Even though a full, epic quest would have been fun, I enjoy and respect Bethesda’s method. These scattered pieces add to Skyrim’s world and reward players who would rather find something organically than follow quest markers.With both minor quests and world-changing quests deleted from the game, Skyrim could have been significantly different. We still love the game, but here are 25 epic things Bethesda deleted that make the game even more fun.As the oldest city in Skyrim, Windhelm boasts tradition and ancient architecture. In fact, Windhelm used to include a building reminiscent of ancient Rome: the Windhelm Pit. Bethesda originally intended to send Eastmarch criminals to the Windhelm Pit, a prison where inmates battle each other in a crowd-filled arena.You’d have to fight your way to freedom!The Windhelm Pit would have been absolutely incredible. Instead of wasting time in a regular prison, you’d battle in an epic arena for freedom and glory. Bethesda even developed a cast of incredible characters within the Pit.As if Windhelm Pit wasn’t already epic enough, Bethesda developed an epic “society” within Skyrim’s version of the Colosseum. Bethesda wrote bribery, rivalry, friendships (including friendships between inmates and guards), and more into this demented prison.Even your own rivals might’ve made their way into the Pit.If you hadn’t already ended Alain Dufont in the Dark Brotherhood questline, he would have appeared within the Pit as another inmate. Who knows who else might have showed up in the Pit if Bethesda had finished this incomplete, unused content?I love the surreal, creepy world within the “Mind of Madness” quest. You literally battle Pelagius’s inner demons, all while Pelagius has a tea party (a wonderful allusion to Alice in Wonderland).Bethesda cut even crazier content from the quest.If you remove the invisible walls in Pelagius’s mind with console commands, you’ll discover a secret door. It stands in the middle of a field, seemingly leading to nowhere. But if you step inside the door, you’ll spawn inside a house with more doors leading to even stranger locations. With endless tunnels, shrinking houses, levitating chairs, and abnormal gravity, you might never find your way out of the madman’s mind.All the unused content in Pelagius’s mind is amazing, but the shrinking house deserves its own page. When you step into the door in the middle of the field, you appear within this house. The doors in the house lead to other areas, but you can also step through one of the walls. If you do, you step outside the house—and the house shrinks. The further you step from the house, the further it shrinks. As you grow in size, you’ll notice that the house is actually a model. It rests on a table of “normal” size within a typical Skyrim dungeon. Talk about psychedelic.Only the most dedicated Skyrim explorers have found the “Ancient Traveler’s Skull.” This skull rests in Wayward Pass, without any body in sight.The skull used to belong to a headless spirit!Bethesda originally included the Spirit of the Ancient Traveler as an enemy. It’s unclear whether the spirit would have defended its skull or even been related to a quest. Regardless, the Ancient Traveler’s body was never programmed. I guess we’ll never know how the Ancient Traveler said goodbye or where its body went.In the magical College of Winterhold, Phinis Gestor informs you that the former class of students has completely disappeared. He tells you of the four apprentices and their magical ambitions before disappearing. Bethesda originally planned to turn this into a quest where you locate the four apprentices (all deceased) and inform Phinis of their fates.Even though Bethesda deleted the quest, you can still find the apprentices!The four apprentices’ bodies lie scattered around Skyrim due to magical mishaps—all of which connect to Phinis’ descriptions. This “easter egg” makes a nice, epic reward for determined players who seek the apprentices or luckily stumble across them.Bethesda originally planned to include a quest called “Supply Line.” Two twins, Rundi and Borvir, would have opened a meadery and asked you to deliver their mead around the world.What makes this unused quest so epic is that it’s actually an alternate ending.In the final game, Rundi and Borvir never opened a meadery. They instead were defeated in a magical accident. In fact, these twins are actually part of the unused “Missing Apprentices” quest. Their master explains that they were determined to make an excellent mead, and they were never seen again—although you can still discover their bodies.After completing “Boethiah’s Calling,” you become Boethiah’s champion and never interact with the Daedric Prince again. However, Bethesda started development on another quest called “Boethiah’s Bidding.” This incomplete quest would have had you defeated Elisif, Jarl of Solitude, in Boethiah’s name. Elisif’s Thane, Erikur, would have become the new Jarl.I’m curious if Bethesda would have explained Boethiah’s motives. Did she have a grudge against Elisif? Did she want to change the political world for her benefit? Or did she simply think adding more chaos to the world would be amusing?Nirya carries an unending, unexplained grudge against Faralda throughout Skyrim. Despite this, the two students never cause a scene at the College of Winterhold.At least, they don’t cause a scene in the released game.Bethesda deleted a quest titled “Research Thief” in which Nirya asks you to steal Faralda’s research notes. You would’ve had the choice to either steal the notes or inform Faralda of Nirya’s plans. This epic quest would have determined your relationships with both characters. Sadly, Bethesda took the easy route by making you friends with all your fellow students.Have you ever wondered why Nazeem—advisor to the Jarl of Whiterun, owner of the fruitful Chillfurrow Farm, arrogant nobleman who looks down on all others, notorious visitor of the Cloud District—sleeps in a common inn with the kind of people he despises? If you pickpocket him, you’ll notice he carries a key to Wintersand Manor. But no such place exists…right?The manor was never finished, but the location still exists.Using console commands, you’ll discover Bethesda programmed a location titled “Wintersand Manor.” So Nazeem used to have a home! I suspect Bethesda abandoned the manor but forgot to remove the key from Nazeem’s inventory.The College of Winterhold is a mysterious organization. Many people distrust the magical college. Some members practice dark arts like necromancy, and students at the College often get slain or disappear. Nonetheless, the College feels mostly benevolent, and they stay isolated from the rest of the world in order to avoid unnecessary disaster and conflict.Originally, the College included a radiant quest called “Rogue Wizard” where you hunt down an “Insane College Wizard.” This might sound righteous, but I find it incredibly dark. Instead of trying to help the insane student, the College sends its own student to end the insane wizard and preserve the College’s reputation.Skyrim already includes some mourning for deceased NPCs, particularly if the NPC is eliminated where other characters can see it. However, Bethesda originally planned to make death a more significant component of the game. The unused programming and voice clips of the game reveal that if you had defeated a generic NPC with a family, that NPC would resurrect as a ghost and follow that family member. The family would mourn the NPC’s death, and their ghost would forever haunt the family.If you run into an invisible chest in Dawnstar, don’t freak out. It’s not a bug—it’s a secret!Since the chest nearly matches the inventories of merchants across Skyrim, fans theorize that a merchant used to be set up just outside Dawnstar. When Bethesda deleted the merchant, they either forgot to delete the chest or thought burying it five feet underground would be adequate. We appreciate that Bethesda overlooked this invisible chest—it makes a nice reward for players who stumble across it!After a certain amount of time, bodies in Skyrim disappear. They seem to be forever deleted—but are they really? Bethesda actually programmed the game to teleport the bodies into a new location, thus keeping track of which NPCs are deceased and which are not.All the bodies appear in a single room—and it’s absolutely terrifying.The X-shaped room is way too small for the death count in Skyrim. If you end too many characters, they’ll pile on top of each other or even occupy the same space. You can access this room via console commands, but be warned: this room isn’t for the light of heart.“The Whispering Door” is already a dark quest. Balgruuf’s son, Nelkir, hears “secrets” from the Whispering Lady. For example, she tells Nelkir that he’s actually Balgruuf’s illegitimate son. Nelkir swears one day he’ll defeat Balgruuf, but Nelkir does nothing else in this quest. Instead, the Whispering Lady (Mephala) asks you to destroy your own friends.Originally, Nelkir was going to end his own father!Bethesda originally planned for Mephala to influence every one of Balgruuf’s children. Frothar would defeat his own horse, and Nelkir, Frothar, and Dagny would all eliminate their father.Karinda is actually the same horse Frothar would have ended in the original “Whispering Door” quest. Because much of that quest was cut from the final game, Karinda can only be accessed via PC console commands. Since she wasn’t completely developed and was intended solely as a quest “object,” she’s completely invincible! And when you ride her, she only sprints! Unlike other horses, Karinda never runs out of energy. If you need to get somewhere fast without fast travel, Karinda’s the horse for you!If you ever run into M’aiq the Liar while playing Skyrim, count yourself lucky. This lying Khajit has incredible dialogue with hilarious jokes, including meta jokes. When he isn’t wandering Skyrim, he lives in a room named after the Khajit’s homeland: Elsweyr.So you see, this room is ironically epic. M’aiq tells outrageous stories, so of course, he gave his room an outrageous name. You can only enter this tiny room—which lacks windows, doors, or any form of entrance—using console commands.Runil seems like an insignificant minor character, despite his troubled past. He regrets fighting and destroying in the Great War, so he became a priest of Arkay. In his only quest, he asks you to retrieve his journal, which he calls his “collection of regrets.” The journal reveals that he mysteriously fears the Thalmor and actively avoids their radar.In a deleted quest, you discover Runil used to be Thalmor!At the end of the quest, a truly repentant Runil asks you to keep his secret safe. If you don’t make this promise, you can tell his friends of his dark past, and they no longer trust him.Bethesda deleted multiple letters, notes, and books from Skyrim—including two epic letters written about you! These two anonymous letters are almost exactly like, but one tries to convince the Stormcloaks to recruit you while the other tries to convince the Imperials. They state that you were involved in some sort of scandalous affair, and evidence of that affair can be used to persuade you to join the war.Even though these letters wouldn’t have made sense in the final game, I love how epic they are! They add wonderful paranoia into the game. Who knows what mysterious figure or force is watching you?Even though you can technically become part of the Bards College, the College sadly doesn’t give you much. However, Bethesda originally planned a quest for members of the Bards College. Titled “Collecting the Edda,” the quest would require that you learn the entirety of the Poetic Edda from bards around Skyrim.You can still hear pieces of the Poetic Edda, but it’s not the same.This awesome quest would have turned you into a true bard. You would’ve learned the history of Skyrim from master bards, allowing you to carry on their legacy and preserve the wonderful art of oral history.Skyrim contains a lot of incredible armor, clothing, tools, and weapons, but Bethesda deleted a lot of other outfits. You can use console commands to unlock and equip many deleted items—or even equip items in the game that are normally unattainable. For example, you normally can’t equip the clothes and armor worn by Daedric Princes, but console commands overcome this obstacle.I personally love the Executioner’s Robes the most. I wish Bethesda had made these accessible in the regular game. Battling an Executioner would be amazing, and wearing their armor afterward would be so satisfying.Skyrim used to have a location called Irontree Lumber Mill run by two Nordic brothers, Steirod and Trilf. These cool brothers were veterans of the Great War between the Thalmor and Nords.Even though the brothers offered no quests, I’m really sad they weren’t around to build on Skyrim’s lore. There are Great War veterans scattered around Skyrim. These brothers would have been the perfect opportunity to build Skyrim’s world and fill in the missing gaps in Skyrim’s history.Bethesda sadly removed a book titled “The Secrets of Ragnvald” that would have wonderfully added to Skyrim’s lore. In Ragnvald, you must defeat two Draugr Deathlords in order to reach Otar the Mad, a Dragon Priest. Each Deathlord carries a key (Torsten’s Skull Key and Saerek’s Skull Key) that unlocks Otar’s tomb.The deleted book held a poem depicting the history of these characters. It tells the story of how King Otar went mad from voices in his head. He caused much destruction until Torsten and Saerek rebelled. Since the Nordic heroes couldn’t end Otar, they sealed him away.Who knows how they turned into Deathlords. Regardless, they fought to keep Otar sealed away in both life and death.Of all the deleted content fans and modders have found in Skyrim’s hidden code, this is the most significant. With soldiers across the land, the Civil War seems like it should significantly affect the world—yet the questline is surprisingly short. Fans discovered that the Civil War questline used to be far larger and less linear. The battles would have been bigger, the armies could seize and lose holds across Skyrim, and you could complete multiple radiant quests in order to turn the tide.Of course, Bethesda could only do so much in their massive game. Nonetheless, we wish Bethesda had built the expansive, ambitious Civil War they initially dreamed of.We missed out on various quests and large battles in the deleted Civil War content, but I’m especially sad the giants didn’t make it into the Civil War. Bethesda originally planned quests that would allow you to recruit giants into your army. Can you imagine how epic that would be!? A single giant could probably defeat an army and seize a city all on its own.I wonder if Bethesda planned to include any other species into the war. Regardless, the giants are the only species Bethesda removed from the questline.ThePremium grants you  UNLIMITED AD FREE ACCESS  accross our full Network!Have an account? Login here",

      "ReadersGambitPosted by Esler on Wednesday, March 9, 2016 · Leave a CommentRoguelikes have always been a staple on PC for indie developers, everyone seems to have their take on the genre. As somebody who doesn’t own a PC, or at least a PC modern enough to run more than MS paint and a web browser, it has been both a blessing and a curse when waiting and hoping for some interesting – almost niche – titles to trickle down to home consoles. Thankfully Dungeon of the Endless was not lost in the sea of similar roguelikes and will be arriving on the Xbox One shortly.\n\nDungeon of the Endless blends that staple mechanics of a roguelike RPG and blends them effortlessly with tower defense, cooperative play, and interesting characters to provide and experience unlike any I have been able to enjoy before. French Developer Amplitude Studios have went above and beyond when it comes to blending the two, creating character archetypes and objects that allow players to approach defensively or split from the pack of survivors and become a lone wolf.Although the story of Dungeon of the Endless is not formally relayed through cutscenes or dialogue there is a great deal of information nestled in the characters and the picture album, which only unlocks certain information when criteria is met. Which is a true shame, as a little more story or information could carry Dungeon of the Endless a bit further, especially when it comes to character interaction and understanding. For the most part the only aspects of the story you really need to know are that you were previously aboard a prison ship, and that you have now crash landed on a planet inhabited by an ancient race known as the “Endless”. As Dungeon of the Endless is technically an installment in the “Endless” series it would have been nice to either play previous installments or have a brief introduction explaining the nature of what may have happened previously. Although as I am unfamiliar with the series there may be little to no tangible connections between the games, bar some similar settings and lore.In spite of Dungeon of the Endless lacking in story, there is a great deal of character and information nestled in both the environments and playable characters, some of which are not playable at first. When you initially crash land deep below the planet’s surface the areas are loaded with technology and small creatures ready to attack on sight, suggesting that these levels have remained largely unattended, but the further up you climb the more human enemies look and the more complex the dungeons aesthetic becomes as you draw closer to the “Endless”. It’s what Amplitude have managed to achieve with a very limited style, making subtle changes at every turn, that keeps players interested and invested. At times these environments would feel like they draw inspiration from the greats of sci-fi cinema, like Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, but put their own spin on it.Just like the environments of Dungeon of the Endless there is a vast and varied cast with all manners of stats, attributes, and equipment that means you will want to try every single character to find a best fit for your chosen run. Some characters will have higher hitpoints, and strength, but lack the ability to get certain perks because of a low with stat. Others will be boosted by grouping together, giving players stat boosts when in the same room, and even providing a heal when their skill replenishes. All this variety leads to numerous characters being able to boost resource generation, being more suitable for exploration, or just aiding the team by repairing damaged turrets, or by defending the crystal in the first tile. With changing scenarios and different team compositions/approaches, there are countless ways of building a team to see you through to the end of the various modes available. Personally I loved going Warden Mormish, as I was able to use his abilities to generate dust efficiently while operating modules for extra resources because of his perks. And coupling him with a strong independent character meant that he was able to sit back and generate resources without much stress.All of these wonderful designs are pulled together in Dungeon of the Endless’s various “Pods”. Prior to starting a mission you are given the option to select one pod, a basic pod with no attributes or modifiers, and you proceed to escape the prison ship as it crashes to the planet. Once the game officially starts you are tasked with finding the escape point to the floor by exploring a succession of procedurally generated rooms. Each room potentially poses a threat of having monsters inhabiting it, or proves as a paradise with its own power source allowing you to build turrets and resource modules. As you progress there are various instances, some of which good and others bad, that can power down rooms, provide new equipment through chests or merchants, or provide much needed resources in the form of stock piles – there are even some gambling type instances in which you can wager your current resources for a chance at the contents of a “Dust Factory” or “Cryotube”. By clearing rooms, or through successful instances, you will generate much needed resources. These various resources can be used to power rooms, level up characters, heal, build items, purchase equipment from merchants, and research upgrades.Both resource management and turret placement play an integral part of Dungeon of the Endless and learning what turrets best suit the area you are in and how to place items is key. Saving your “dust” – the resource used to light a room – to section off entire areas means that no enemies are able to spawn, preventing the need to build defensive turrets around resource modules, saving you valuable resources, but also presents a massive risk as you never have enough dust to light every room on the floor without very specific characters in the perfect scenario. This ebb and flow between risk and reward applies to almost every aspect of Dungeon of the Endless, and when you manage to secure an entire floor while netting a large number of resources you are overcome by an immense feeling of satisfaction. In fact the first time I finally completed a dungeon I took a few moments to bask in the brilliant illustrated end game screen and savoured the moment before diving right back in.And you needn’t dive in alone. Dungeon of the Endless supports up to 4 players at once, although in changing to multiplayer you lose the ability to select a pod. So all these challenges can be tackled with your friends, adding a new layer to how you manage resources and who gets to do what. Sometimes it might just result in a shouting match between the group as somebody opened a door before everyone is ready and now the crystal is in bits and you have lost all the power to the rooms because of a player’s enthusiasm for opening doors.It’s this persistent and enthralling experience that keeps Dungeon of the Endless going, the ability to conquer difficult levels and persevere through increasingly resistant enemy forces will have you chomping at the bit before. Over time you will unlock some more complex pods with different modifiers and the learning process starts all over again. No matter what difficulty you are on, the enchanting soundtrack lures you in as you strap yourself in to the escape pods for another round. I have never quite found as much joy in a roguelike as I have with Dungeon of the Endless and for fans of both tower defence games and roguelikes I couldn’t recommend it enough.Category: Games, Reviews · Tags: Amplitude Studios, Blackrock Mountain, Dungeon of the Endless, iOS, PC, X1, Xbox OneComments are closed.Copyright © 2018 · All Rights Reserved · ReadersGambitMagazine Theme v4 by Organic Themes · WordPress Hosting · RSS Feed · Log in",

      "Dungeon of the Endless is a quirky little side project from French video game creators Amplitude Studios, makers of the acclaimed strategy titles Endless Space and Endless Legend.In a nutshell, it's a roguelike / tower defense hybrid with a solid, pixelated art style, set in the same universe as the developer's other two games. However, it bears the distinct mark of the Amplitude pedigree, offering an engaging and strategic experience, in spite of its more casual / random initial outlook.I liked Amplitude's turn-based strategy titles a lot, and I was intrigued by Dungeon of the Endless, in no small part due to the superb, colorful and flashy pixel graphics, so I jumped right in quite enthusiastically.You assume control of the survivors of a crashed spacecraft, trying to survive on an alien planet, discovering a network of underground tunnels and the remnants of ancient technology, the only evidence of a now extinct civilization.The destinies of the few survivors reside within your grasp, and it's up to you to gather resources and build an infrastructure and mount up a defense, exploring the labyrinth room by room.Dungeon of the Endless is thematically tied to the universe Amplitude's strategy games take place in, as the planet you have crashed on is Auriga itself, one of the prime bases of the ancient space-faring race known as the Endless.Exiting your escape pod, you find yourself stranded many floors below the planet's surface, in a huge, sprawling facility overrun by countless unknown horrors. You have to make your way to the surface floor by floor, clearing the hostile alien life forms and making the most out of the limited resources you find along your way.You start with a team of two heroes, stranded in a small room powered by your escape pod's power module. You start opening doors, gathering resources, fending off attacks from the aliens, powering new rooms, building new structures, and so on and so forth ad nauseam until you get to the top floor or die, the latter having a much greater chance of being the outcome of your toils.Dungeon of the Endless uses the FIDS resource system pioneered by Endless Space. With each door opened, you earn a small quantity of food, industry, science and dust, which functions as both currency and a source of power.Killing enemies will also earn you a little dust, and (if you're fortunate) you can also stumble upon hidden caches of resources, or chests containing various pieces of weaponry or armor, to outfit your heroes.Industry is used for building new structures, food for healing, recruiting and leveling heroes, and science for unlocking new technology, such as better defensive and offensive turrets and structures, and better resource generators.You start off with a team of two brave warriors, but the count can be upped to a maximum of four, which you will encounter and recruit while exploring the dungeon.Each time you open a new door, you get a small number of resources, based on your current yield, and gain access to a new random room. Rooms can have treasure chests, vendors, new heroes, and minor and major structure slots in them, and in order to build anything in a room (and have it function too), you need enough dust to power it up.Having a room all lit up not only improves the pixelated visuals with a bit of extra polish, it also prevents monsters from spawning there, so you can employ unused dust to control where you get attacked from.Of course, you'll never have enough dust to power everything, so choosing what and when to switch on and off is just one part of the many strategic decisions you'll have to make in order to ensure your survival.Establishing chokepoints through which to drive all incoming aliens is also a much smarter approach than simply building turrets everywhere, especially since you won't have enough resources to fortify your entire base.Leveling heroes will make them slightly stronger and offer them extra abilities, such as being able to repair damaged structures after a battle, or to bestow a small defensive or offensive buff when fighting alongside teammates.Overall, it's a game of gaining small, incremental advantages over the unforgiving dungeon. You don't control the heroes directly, you just tell them what room to head to, and they engage enemies or find something else to do by themselves.Employing the heroes' mobility is key to surviving the hordes of incoming monsters, as turrets are usually too weak to be able to finish off stronger or bunched-up enemies, and you're going to spring a lot of leaks.The aliens are always drawn toward your energy core, so you can sort of plot their route by powering certain rooms up or down, focusing on the best way to take them down with a concerted attack, instead of spreading your forces too thin.Aside from primary resource generation buildings, you'll also be able to build a vast array of turrets, with effects ranging from area of effect damage to slowing enemies down, complete with support buildings that give your other structures extra defense or increase the health points total of nearby heroes.There are a lot of random combinations that you will stumble upon while kicking doors down, and it's going to take you a few playthroughs to figure out what best suits your play style, as well as where to focus your efforts.There are also new starting spaceships and heroes to unlock, ensuring that you also have other goals once you start mastering survival, and there is an album section that gets filled in with various relevant pieces of concept art and flavor text, gradually revealing more about the characters that you're leading into battle, and about the mysterious world you are exploring.The first thing that caught my eye, a few months ago when the game was announced, was the superb way that Amplitude's artists employ pixels. The game looks great, with vivid colors and rich special effects, and the backgrounds are littered with the artifacts of an ancient civilization.Everything, from the choice of color to the animations of the lowliest spider that will try to make you its dinner, is done with painstaking attention to detail, and it looks gorgeous.It very quickly becomes apparent that the high-resolution pixel art is not a way to cut on the visual budget, but a way to convey a unique idea in a very powerful, personalized manner. If there are occasions where pixel art can detract from the overall atmosphere and experience, this is certainly not it.If anything, the seemingly simplistic visuals only enhance the frugal undertones of your adventure, and it's the same with the sound design, everything goes well together and fits right in, further contributing to the game's atmospheric feel, to the overpowering sensation of dread and hopelessness.The music is a welcome companion through your woes, combining the base elements of old-school chiptunes with modern, high-definition compositions, feeling somehow both ancient and brand new.Overall, Dungeon of the Endless' artistic direction, in both visuals and sound production, is an uncanny marriage, a throwback to our childhood, that somehow manages to also feel very contemporary, very up-to-date, and to convey more than just stuff moving on the screen, to immerse one in the unforgiving journey through the decrepit game world.The resource and hero management bits offer more demanding players a welcome layer of decision-making, and all the unlockables make for slight variations in the base formula, enough to keep things fresh and offer the occasional new challenge.To top it all off, it sounds and looks great. The only bad thing it did was to leave me with a lingering desire to find something more than a randomly generated deathtrap at its core, but Amplitude already has plenty to offer on the depth front.It's hard to compare it to anything else, as it borrows from so many genres, and complete with its brilliant aesthetic, it offers an experience that is unique, feeling somehow both merciless and fair, thoroughly engaging and very satisfying.",

    "title": "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth",
    "text": [
      "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is an independent roguelike video game designed by Edmund McMillen, and is developed and published by Nicalis. Rebirth is a remake of The Binding of Isaac developed by McMillen and Florian Himsl and first released in 2011 as an Adobe Flash application. The Flash platform had limitations that led McMillen to work with Nicalis to produce Rebirth using a more advanced game engine to surpass these limitations and allowing McMillen to include additional content and gameplay features. Rebirth was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita in November 2014, and for Xbox One, New Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U in July 2015. After having Apple reject the Rebirth game due to its content, Nicalis has gotten Apple's pre-approval to release an iOS version, which was released on January 11, 2017. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released on March 17, 2017.\nAs with the original game, Rebirth's story is based on the Biblical tale of the Binding of Isaac and is inspired by McMillen's own childhood growing up in a religious family. The player controls a young boy named Isaac whose mother, convinced she is doing the work of God, strips him of all his clothes and possessions and locks him in his room. With his mother about to sacrifice him, Isaac escapes to the basement and fights through randomized dungeons created in a roguelike fashion. The player defeats monsters using Isaac's tears as projectiles and collects items that improve Isaac's attributes and abilities. Eventually, the player must face Isaac's mother. Two expansions have been released, Afterbirth and Afterbirth+, in October 2015 and January 2017, respectively, each introducing more game content and gameplay modes, with Afterbirth+ further adding support for user-created content.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nSimilar to the original, Rebirth is a top-down 2D roguelike game where the player controls the character Isaac (or 10 unlockable characters) as he adventures throughout his mother's basement, fighting off monsters and collecting power-ups. Ultimately, the player aims to first defeat Isaac's mother while she tries to crush him underfoot, then moves inside her, where the player must defeat Isaac's mom's heart. Rebirth is considered a roguelike-like game; the dungeon levels are procedurally generated into a number of rooms including at least one boss battle, and the game has permadeath: once the chosen character dies from taking too much damage, the game is over and the player will have to restart. Rebirth allows the player to save the state of the game, allowing them to quit the game during a run, and come back later to finish that run, though this save state is deleted upon restarting the game.The game is controlled similarly to a twin-stick shooter: the player moves their character around the screen while they are able to shoot the tears that they cry in another direction. These tears act as bullets to defeat enemies that try to harm the player-character. The player-character's health is tracked by a number of hearts: the character can find items that can replenish hearts while others grant the character additional hearts, extending their health. Throughout the dungeons the player-character will find bombs, which can be used to both damage foes and blow up obstacles, keys to open certain doors and treasure chests, coins to buy items at various stores, and a large number of items that impact the character's attributes, such as speed and the damage and range of their tears, and other gameplay effects, such as gaining a character that floats behind the player-character and aids in combat. Some of these items are passive, others are active and reusable, requiring the player to wait a number of rooms before they can reuse it, while others are single use items that disappear after use. The player can typically collect any number of passive items, their effects stacking on previous ones, potentially creating powerful combinations for the player. Otherwise, the player can only carry one reusable item and one single-use item, replacing it for another if they pick such up. Among other rooms within the dungeons include special challenge rooms and mini-boss fights.In addition to expanding greatly on the number of items, monsters, and room types (including those that span multiple screens) from the original game, Rebirth provides integrated support for controller support. Rebirth allows for a second local player to join in on a drop in/drop out mechanic. While active, the second player controls a follower of the first player-character that has all of the same attributes and abilities of that character, though will cost the first player-character one heart to use which is given to the follower character. This second character, however, cannot plant bombs or carry items. Rebirth also provides a feature that allows players to enter the random seed for a run, which will regenerate the same dungeon with the same items and monster population when used. The player is presented with this seed after completing a run, or when the game is paused, which they can reuse again or share with others.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe plot in Rebirth remains the same as the original game, following along the biblical tale of the same name. The young boy Isaac had been living happily with his mom. One day, spurred on by watching too many religious programs on the television, his mom believed she received instruction that Isaac had become corrupted and she must try to save him. First, she removed all his possessions, including his toys and clothes, believing these were corrupting him. Later, she locked him in his room to never be let out so as to protect him from the evils that existed outside. After hearing the further instruction that to show her devotion to her faith she must sacrifice her son, Isaac flees from his approaching mother through a trap door into the basement, leading to the events within the game.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nThe Binding of Isaac was originally developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl in 2011 from an internal game jam following the completion of McMillen's previous game, Super Meat Boy. With Super Meat Boy being successful, McMillen had not concerned himself with making a popular game, and instead wanted to craft a game that melded the top-down dungeon approach of The Legend of Zelda with the roguelike genre, wrapping that in a religious allegory based on his own childhood experiences. They used Adobe Flash as it enabled them to develop the game quickly. McMillen quietly released the game to Steam for personal computers, where it proved to be very popular. Looking to expand the game, McMillen and Himsl discovered limitations on Flash that made expansion difficult. Though they were able to incorporate more content through the Wrath of the Lamb expansion, McMillen had to forego a second planned expansion due to the Flash limitations.After the release of the original game, McMillen was approached by Tyrone Rodriguez of Nicalis, a development and publishing studio that had helped to bring personal computer games Cave Story and VVVVVV to consoles. Rodriguez offered Nicalis' services to help port The Binding of Isaac to consoles. McMillen was interested but required that they needed to recreate the game outside of Flash to incorporate the additional material he had to forego previously, and to fix some additional bugs found since release. McMillen also asked to be left out of the business side of the game's release following his negative experiences in dealing with business matters with Super Meat Boy, which Rodriguez agreed to. Rebirth was announced in November 2012 as a console version of The Binding of Isaac, with plans to improve the graphics to 16-bit colors and incorporate the content planned for the second expansion as well as new material. Local cooperative play was also to be added to the game, though McMillen stated they could not add online co-operative play as that would drastically lengthen the development time.McMillen wanted to overhaul the entire game, particularly its graphics as he felt they were an \"eyesore\". After polling players to determine which art style to use for the remake, McMillen and Nicalis brought in artists to improve the original assets for the new style and began working on the new content. McMillen also commissioned a new soundtrack for the remake from Matthias Bossi and Jon Evans.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nInitially, McMillen and Rodriguez felt that they would develop Rebirth for the Nintendo 3DS, as a tribute to its roots in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. In 2012, Nintendo refused to allow the game to be released for the 3DS, as, at the time, the original The Binding of Isaac had received game classifications placing it as a mature game with potentially objectionable content, and Nintendo did not publish such titles for its systems. Though they had spent some time on creating the 3DS version before the refusal, McMillen and Rodriguez decided to focus on personal computer and releases for the PlayStation platforms instead. These platforms gave them more capabilities to work with, allowing them to increase the capabilities of the game. In addition to the PlayStation 3 and Vita consoles, Nicalis was in discussions with Microsoft for a release on the Xbox systems; McMillen had also considered a possible iOS release in the future. McMillen and Nicalis opted to move development from the PlayStation 3 to the newly announced PlayStation 4 in August 2013, announcing its release at Sony's Gamescom presentation. The PlayStation 4 and Vita versions were released alongside the versions for personal computers on November 4, 2014.During development, three senior employees within Nintendo—Steve Singer, the vice president of licensing; Mark Griffin, a senior manager in licensing, and Dan Adelman, the head of indie development—all championed the game within Nintendo. The three continued to work within Nintendo, and in 2014, were able to secure approval to allow Rebirth to be released for the 3DS and the Wii U. McMillen and Nicalis, having spent time on the game tailored to run on more powerful systems, worked to try to keep the game intact while porting it to the 3DS. They spent about a year on this conversion, and while they had got the game to work on the original 3DS model, the performance was sub-optimal for the game. With help from Nintendo, they were one of the first developers to secure a development kit for the New Nintendo 3DS, which had more powerful hardware and memory to support running the game at the desired speed to match the other platform releases. The announcement of the New 3DS and Wii U versions was made alongside plans for an Xbox One version. The release of the game for all three systems was on July 23, 2015.In January 2016, Nicalis had reported they were working on an iOS port of the game, but in the following month, the company reported that Apple had rejected the application from their app store citing that the game depicts \"violence towards children\" and is against their content policies. Nicalis has worked with Apple to gain pre-approval and will release a universal iOS version of Rebirth including the Afterbirth+ expansion with additional improvements for that platform, including the use of iCloud for ease-of-play across multiple devices. While they are looking to add this onto the Vita's port, Nicalis stated it was a very low priority for them due to the limited processing ability of the device to handle many weapon combos. The initial version iOS version of the core game, without expansions, was released on January 11, 2017.After teasing of a potential release on the upcoming Nintendo Switch console, Nicalis confirmed in January 2017 that Rebirth with both expansions will be released for the Switch in March 2017 as both a retail and digital title for the system; though initially set to be released on March 3 on a launch title, last minute adjustments required Nicalis to delay the titles until March 17. Because of their existing relationship with Nintendo for both Wii U and New Nintendo 3DS versions, Rodriguez said that they were able to get developer prototype hardware for the Switch to port the game to that system. Rodriguez said they were able to get Rebirth working on the Switch easily, due to both their own approach for developing Rebirth with appropriate hooks that would be integrated into the respective system features such as Achievements as to make porting easy, and the ease of the Switch's development platform. The game was ultimately released for Switch on March 17, 2017. This version allows up to four players in a drop-in/drop-out co-operative mode, with the other three players using Joy-Con to control one of Isaac's \"buddies\" as with the 2-player co-op mode for personal computers. The physical version of the Switch game includes a manual fashioned similar to the manual that shipped with the original The Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\n\n=== Afterbirth expansion ===\nIn February 2015, McMillen announced the first expansion for Rebirth, titled Afterbirth. Afterbirth added items, enemies, alternate floors and bosses, and endings. In Afterbirth, Greed Mode is added, which is a different game mode than the main game, said to be much harder. It was released on October 30, 2015 for Windows, OS X, and Linux computers. The expansion was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions on May 10, 2016. The expansion is unlikely to be released on any other platforms due to limitations of these platforms' hardware capabilities and the more complex mechanics required by Afterbirth.In programming the original The Binding of Isaac, McMillen had placed a number of hidden secrets within the game, which fans had started to discover and discuss on a Reddit subforum. With the dedication to finding these secrets by fans, McMillen took added steps to further hide these within patches and updates. With Rebirth, McMillen knew players would be seeking out any hidden secrets, and had taken steps to make the existence of a new playable character, the Lost, completely hidden. Unlocking it required a number of highly specific steps including having the player-character die over and over in specific circumstances, and hints for what needed to be done were scattered about the game's assets. As such, McMillen and his team anticipated it would take a long time before players would discover the Lost. However, on release of Rebirth, players on the Reddit subforum took to the game's executable files to search for clues about secrets within the game, discovering the existence of the Lost and the means to unlock it within about 109 hours of the game's release. At the time, McMillen said he was disappointed with the community, feeling that his team took effort to hide these types of secrets to be found by the community through gameplay and clues within the game itself and not by looking to the program's executable; while he was still planning to release Afterbirth, McMillen said that he was not going to hurry its release knowing that players would do a similar investigation on its release.With the Afterbirth expansion, McMillen wanted again to hide another character, this being the Keeper, as well as elements related to Isaac's father which the game already hints at, but knew that players would data-mine the program files to find it. Instead, he planned an alternate reality game (ARG) that would require players to work in the real world as well to discover clues. At the same time, McMillen was expecting the birth of his daughter at the end of September 2015, but with the expansion planned for an October release, so he had to arrange the ARG to continue in lieu of his presence. When Afterbirth was released, players found what they thought were bugs in the game, such as lacking a number of new items that had been promised by the game's store page, and some players accused McMillen of deceiving them. Though some of these omissions were planned as part of the ARG, McMillen discovered that the released game had accidentally lacked some of these new items using a different build than as planned, and his team raced to patch the game, as well as trying to provide support and hints about the Keeper's existence using the number 109 which had become a part of the mythos in the players' culture. McMillen later commented that he found that the missing items that should have been in the released game had distracted players from the secrets he had purposely hidden.With the release of this patch, players began to discover in-game hints towards the Keeper, engaging in McMillen's ARG as planned. Some of the clues included calling a special phone number, and identifying real world locations around the Santa Cruz area, where McMillen is located, that were tied to the game. Following additional clues, including locating a buried figure of one of the game's mini-bosses, the community was able to unlock the Keeper in the game and additional in-game items to collect. Though McMillen thought in the end the ARG worked out, he believes he would not engage the community in a similar manner to avoid making himself look like an ego-driven person.\n\n\n=== Afterbirth+ expansion ===\nIn December 2015, Nicalis announced that a second expansion was in development, titled Afterbirth+. In addition to adding monsters, bosses, items, and a playable character to the game, the expansion includes a bestiary that tracks how many of each type of creature and boss the player has cumulatively defeated, and modding support to allow players to craft room types, import their own graphics, and script out events using the Lua language. The expansion was released for Windows platforms on January 3, 2017 and during Q2 2017 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as downloadable content. The Switch version of the game was released in North America on March 17, 2017 and was released in Europe and Australasia on September 7, 2017. This version includes both Afterbirth and Afterbirth+ at release, and limited-time launch editions of the game are available both physically and digitally, making it the first Nicalis-published game to be released physically.\nSome of the best mods developed by the community have been added to the game through \"Booster packs\" (initially planned to be monthly, but later spread out due to constraints), with the first releasing in March 2017, and the fifth and final one being released on May 1st, 2018. Some content within the last two packs include material that was developed by the players that created the Antibirth fan expansion, which McMillen reached out to help support these booster packs.\n\n\n=== Future development ===\nWhile McMillen had wanted to support the modding community and expansions as part of Rebirth's design, he found that several of the ideas started overlapping with his own thoughts of what a sequel would be for The Binding of Isaac. He also found that any further expansions to the game would essentially require him to rework the base game engine from the ground up. As such, with the last Booster packs that contained Antibirth content, he considers that The Binding of Isaac is complete. McMillen plans to focus on smaller games, and still wants to develop within The Binding of Isaac setting; he is planning to release The Legend of Bum-bo, a prequel to The Binding of Isaac later in 2018, which employs different mechanics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Binding of Isaac: Rebirth received \"generally favourable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic, with scores of 86/100 based on 10 critic reviews for personal computers, 88/100 based on 15 critics for the PlayStation 4, 78/100 based on 4 critics for the Nintendo 3DS version, and 85/100 based on 8 critics for the Nintendo Switch. The iOS version received \"universal acclaim\" with a 93/100 based on 4 reviews.Dan Stapleton of IGN praised Rebirth for the seemingly endless variation in gameplay that each run-through creates, giving him \"plenty of motivation\" to continue to play the game, and only criticized the title for its lack of in-game information on the various power-ups one can collect. GameSpot's Brent Todd felt that while the game may initially be disturbing to players with its story and imagery, Rebirth has \"speedy, varied gameplay and seemingly neverending new features\" that would keep the player entertained for a long time. Simon Parkin for Eurogamer said that Rebirth, at times, \"feels like the product of the psychotherapeutic process\", but is \"the most accessible Rogue-like yet made\" due to its easy control scheme and randomization through each run. Nic Rowen for Destructoid said that Rebirth was a vast improvement on the original Binding of Isaac, and that it is \"an incredible experience that can't be missed\".Afterbirth+ received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. Jose Otero for IGN praised the variety of content added by Afterbirth+, stating that \"the unpredictable items and varied enemies make it one of the most wacky and replayable games I’ve ever experienced.\" Peter Glagowksi at Destructoid gave the DLC a positive review and deemed it an \"impressive effort\", but mused that the DLC's base content has little to offer for newcomers to the series.Rock, Paper, Shotgun was critical of the DLC's difficulty, which they believed to be largely derived from random, untelegraphed enemy behavior. Speaking on the design cohesion of Afterbirth+, reviewer Adam Smith characterized the DLC as \"mashing together existing parts of the game and producing either a weak cover version or a clumsy remix\". Review outlet Beastby likewise critiqued the fairness of Afterbirth+, explaining in their review: \"The question isn’t always 'Will I enjoy the gameplay loop?' but rather 'How many unfair runs will it take for me to have one in which I stand a chance?'\" The modding API of Afterbirth+ was described as \"a disappointment\" by members of the Team Alpha modding group, who expressed frustration at both the API's \"massive shortcomings\" and Nicalis' lack of support.As of  July 2015, both The Binding of Isaac and Rebirth have seen combined sales of over 5 million copies; this includes the sales of the original game which had reached 3 million copies sold by July 2014.\n\n\n== The Binding of Isaac: Antibirth ==\nPrior to release of the mod tools with Afterbirth+, a fan-made mod of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth called The Binding of Isaac: Antibirth was released in December 2016. Similar to the official expansions, Antibirth adds a number of playable-characters, bosses, power-ups, and other content, crafted by players in the game's community, while adjusting some of the gameplay aspects that had been changed in the Afterbirth expansion to work more closely with how Rebirth had been originally released. Alice O'Connor of Rock Paper Shotgun considered the mod as a \"more difficult than [The Binding of Isaac]\" and a new challenge to work alongside with the official game expansions. At the request of McMillen, the group reworked some of the Antibirth content that was incorporated within the booster packs for the Afterbirth+ expansion.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
      "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (commonly referred to as Rebirth for short) is the remake of the original Flash game The Binding of Isaac. It was developed by Nicalis with Edmund McMillen in a supervising position. It was originally released on November 4, 2014 on Steam for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux, as well as the PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. It was later released on the Xbox One, 3DS, and Wii U on July 23, 2015. 2 years later, its was released on the Nintendo Switch on March 3, 2017 along with already containing the 2 DLC that were made before.Rebirth features a new, non-Flash-based engine with 16-bit graphics, a new music score, and a redesigned interface intended to streamline gameplay. The game includes all of the content from the original game, as well as the additional content introduced in the Wrath of the Lamb expansion, while adding content that was cut from the original game due to the limitations of Flash.Rebirth was first conceptualized during the release of The Binding of Isaac: Wrath of the Lamb. Edmund McMillen admitted in a 2014 Q&A that there were plans to release another expansion of the game with a similar amount of content. Due to the limitations of Flash, corrupted files, and a general inability to continue support for the game, McMillen was at an impasse. When McMillen was approached by Tyrone Rodriguez of Nicalis about the possibility of a Super Meat Boy remake, McMillen instead suggested a Binding of Isaac remake as a workaround to the wall they had reached in development of the original. Despite bringing in a new developer to help with Rebirth, McMillen stayed in charge of nearly all aspects of the games development as the lead designer.From the beginning, McMillen wanted to implement a completely revamped art style. The original Flash art was completed in two months and McMillen was never quite happy with it. It was voted on by the community and eventually a 16-bit Game Boy Advance art style was chosen. McMillen requested that Rodriguez hand-pick a pixel artist as to not force himself to push other projects back to try and do the art on his own.Also planned from conception were: local 2-player co-op, 150+ new items, level seeds, new endings, and at least three new characters. Something that was deemed impossible at the time of development was support on Nintendo devices (though this was later changed).[2]The Binding of Issac: Rebirth brings back many aspects of the original. At it's core, it is still a top-down, 2D platforming dungeon crawler in which the player controls one of 14 characters and explores the levels of Isaac's basement. The player collects items, trinkets, tarot cards, and pills while attempting to survive a randomly generated dungeon floor composed of hazards such as fire, trapped chests, and challenge rooms. The player must advance through the basement while navigating through a multitude of enemies and bosses of varying rarity and strength.The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth highly favorable reviews from various sources. Multiple reviews gave the remake a higher rating than the original, citing the improvements in gameplay and the introduction of various items, enemies, bosses.Download (Steam)Danny BaranowskyPS4 PS Vita Wii U New 3DSXbox One“\"The creepy-cute dungeons of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth are amazingly different and challenging every time.\"”–Dan Stapleton, IGN, November 25, 2015[5]Metacritic86/100[6]88/100[7]N/A[8]80/100[9]85/100[10]77/100[11]IGN9.0/10[12]Gamespot8/10[13]Destructoid10/10[14]Dark Station4.5/5[15]The \"close to the original but pixelated\" lookThe black outlines lookThe SNES lookThe GBA lookAnother GBA mock-upWhat do you think of THIS!More updates as they unfold!It Moves!

Mystic Runes Upgradeable shopsVersion 1.1First released version.I always knew that this game was amazing and I bought a 3ds mainly to play this game. I ended up selling my ds later on and I always thought that this game was perfect on a handheld device because of how easy it is to run and because of its quick paced nature. The port is incredibly easy to use and is the same thing as on the ds or computer (when talking about the menu ui). This game has all of the items from the computer version and I'm hoping they will continue to add the dlc from the computer which I'm sure they will because of how much praise this app is getting. I hadn't even read anything on this app before I bought it. The second I saw it i dropped $15 because I knew that it would be worth it. This is a great game with great devs and I know that they care about the community and will continue to refine this game. Since it just came out the movement is a little hard but I'm sure I'll get used to it. I just wish you could adjust where the little joysticks are because I have big fingers and would like them to be a little farther away because on portrait mode it's hard for me. The portrait mode made me really excited because it felt like the ds and was incredibly clean and easy to look at. However because I have an IPhone SE which is basically the size of the 5, my fingers often bump into each other while playing which is a big problem. This game is however I think to be one of the best games the App Store has to offer and it was 100% worth the money.I love it!   iOS Isaac has finally arrived!  It's not everything I wanted but it is still incredibly fun.iOS rebirth is everything you'd expect from the game plus they've added portrait mode and they've tweaked the hud to work with fingers.  The game looks amazing and plays very well, without stuttering or any hitches on my iphone 7.The default touch movement controls leave a bit to be desired though, as they are they feel a bit floaty and weird.  I find rooms that require lots of dodging and maneuverability to be incredibly harder with the touch controls then if I was playing on a controller. However the game does have controller support which really should be the way this game is played. The game currently comes with 2 touch modes, but I've yet to find the difference between the two..  The controls aren't terrible though, I did happen to get within 3 hits of killing mom on my very first run (so sad) with 0 damage ups and 1 tears up. No doubt, the game is playable without a Bluetooth controller.   If you were to play with a controller, I'd says this game would be perfect :).Between the original PC version and this version, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth has provided me with more than 300 hours of entertainment. It's a fantastic game with immense depth and variety, and is more than worth the 15 dollar price tag. Honestly, it's almost stealing at that price. For veteran players, this is a great port, offering all the same content as the PC version at a smooth 60 fps. It's not diluted or censored for a mobile audience, and the controls and UI are fantastically adapted to mobile gameplay, with a few control settings to choose from as well as a portrait mode. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone, whether an existing Isaac can looking to take the game with them on the go, or to new players looking for a deep and challenging game that makes mobile gaming with your attention. My only complaint is that the movement is a bit too sensitive, and with a high speed stat, maneuvering through tight areas can be tough.",
      "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a wildly popular video game among teens, has been blocked from Apple's App Store for containing objectionable content, such as promoting the killing one's own mother and violence towards children.The video game, designed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl, is based on a distorted take on the Old Testament story in which God asks Abraham to sacrifice his child, Isaac, to test his faith. Other Biblical characters, including Cain, Judas, Esau, Eve, Samson, Mary Magdalene, also make appearances throughout the game.Reads a description of the game, \"After his mother receives a message from God demanding the life of her son as proof of her faith, Isaac flees into the monster-filled basement of their home, where he must fight to survive. Players control Isaac or one of six other unlockable characters through a procedurally generated dungeon in a rogue-like manner, fashioned after those of The Legend of Zelda defeating monsters in real-time combat while collecting items and power-ups to defeat bosses and eventually Isaac's mom.\"A report from Kotaku notes that earlier in February, Tyrone Rodriguez, founder of Nicalis that publishes Isaac, shared the news on Twitter along with an image containing Apple's rejection notice that reads: \"Your app contains content or features that depict violence towards, or abuse of, children, which is not allowed on the App.\"Kotaku also reported that Rodriguez had been tweeting teaser images of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth running on iPad and iPhone a couple of weeks prior to receiving Apple's rejection notice.Neither Rodriguez nor McMillen has not revealed their plans moving forward, although McMillen has expressed his disappointment about the issue.\"It's very obvious that Apple doesn't think games are art or have any respect for the medium,\" McMillen told GamesBeat. \"It's sad and very ignorant of them to stand by such a stupid and laughable statement. They basically just told every game developer out there that video games are kids toys with no artistic merit.\"However, message boards for Isaac reveal that the game's content is far from innocuous: \"I have been playing this game for a while and tonight I finally got to fight mom!\" reads a message from one contributor. \"Once I got to fight her, I used 'the bible' and beat her...after the credits I came to the start screen where it showed me 'Isaac' atop of mom with exed out eyes as if she had died.\"In the past, McMillen has also claimed that \"[N]othing in the game is really anti-Christian,\" but rather \"a conversation about religion.\"However, others reject such assertions, arguing that Isaac is a direct affront to Christians and a blatant skewering of religion.\"[The game] disgusted me with its gross humor and blatant anti-Christian themes,\" reads a review from the Christ Centered Gamer. \"It's a shame that all of this creativity is misguided and pokes fun of the Bible and Christianity.  Most, but not all, of the bosses are themed after the seven deadly sins (lust, gluttony, pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed)...The whole premise of Isaac taking revenge is nothing like the Bible's version of God foreshadowing His son's sacrifice for asking Abraham to sacrifice his son to God. Isaac was spared in the Bible version.\"Breitbart notes that though Isaac was also originally rejected from the Nintendo 3DS store back in 2012, it was not for violence, instead being blocked for \"questionable religious content,\" and the game is available on all other major digital distributors, including Steam, the Humble Bundle Store, Playstation 4, Playstation Vita, and Xbox One.Isaac had very high scores from game reviewers: GameRankings ranked it 90.20% for PC and 89.42% for PlayStation4; Metacritic scored it 88/100 for PC and 86/100 for PlayStation4 while Destructoid gave it 10/10.Copyright © 2017 The Gospel Herald.

      "At last! The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth ($14.99) has finally released on iOS, and it was well worth the wait. Perhaps the most popular dual-stick shooter roguelike out there, rumors, Apple approvals drama, and a constantly-shifting release date led to this being the white whale for many iOS gamers. As the release date narrowed down to a general range, every day saw one question surely asked: “When’s Isaac coming?\" Well, thanks to a surprise Tuesday night release on January 10th US time, The Binding of Isaac is finally here, and well worth the wait. The scatological, challenging roguelike dual-stick shooter promises challenging gameplay with mountains of secrets to discover.For those who don’t know about why this is a big deal, a little bit of history. The original Binding of Isaac was designed by Edmund McMillen of Super Meat Boy fame, who wound up releasing the original, Flash-developed, version, in 2011. It proved to be a major hit, after which McMillen partnered up with Nicalis to create a bigger, better, and expanded version called The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth which featured new art, expanded gameplay, and a ton of new secrets to discover. This is the version iOS gamers are getting, though the Steam and console versions also have two DLC packs available to them: Afterbirth and Afterbirth+ which add more new content, items, and even new levels and endings. The original game was regarded as a particularly fun and challenging dual-sticker shooter roguelike that plays a lot different from other shooter roguelikes, and this expanded version keeps that similar heterodoxy while adding a ton to the game.Even without the additional DLC, the replay value of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is absolutely bonkers, and unparalleled in the genre. If you get to the point where you beat the game for the first time, that doesn’t really mean much, as there’s more and more to unlock over time. New bosses, new levels, new endings, more runs that you can try to complete. Certain rare items and accomplishments can only be done on certain runs, so you’ll want to dig back in each time as you might discover something you never did before. And between just figuring out how the various items work, to unlocking the many characters, completing the special challenges, and unlocking new item drops, there’s a staggering amount to do.You get the 8-digit seed for each session, and you can play a particular seed again, but playing a specific seed won’t let you unlock items, necessarily. But if you want to practice a particular seed to figure out how to fight certain enemies or bosses, or to figure out how to properly play through to get certain things, perhaps to experiment with optional aspects, you can do that too. Plus, certain seed entries serve as cheat codes, both literal and figurative (giving you powerful items right at the start). But really, that’s the fun of The Binding of Isaac: it manages to simultaneously be a roguelike game that challenges you with something fresh each time, while giving you a lot to discover over time.I will say that Rebirth‘s difficulty can vary wildly depending on the seed you’ve generated. Getting through the early parts of the game when you’re starting out can be a lot easier when you get a powerful weapon early on, though I suppose the rougher starts will toughen you up for runs later on. But still, I found that luck of the draw helps out early on in getting somewhere in Rebirth.This game draws inspiration from the original Legend of Zelda in a way that’s apparent, but not overly so. In fact, you can catch a few retro gaming influences like Centipede and Bomberman that can feel apparent, but not overly referential. They’re adapted quite well into the style of Isaac. The theme is very scatological, and that took a while for me to be okay with, but don’t let it get in the way of enjoying this game because there’s a lot to dig into.The actual combat has a weird feeling to it because your basic shots are Isaac’s tears, and they have a momentum based on how you’re moving when you fire. This means that at the start, firing straight ahead might be a bit tough. But over time, you’ll see that this can be used to get clever angled shots off. But you’ll get plenty of shot modifiers along the way, and optional items that can be used in combat. The familiars that provide helpful attacks while you play are some of the best items. You’ll have to figure out what the cards do (or search the game’s wiki), but the pills you find have randomized effects from a pool of consistent effects each time you play. Learning how to use everything properly, that discovery of what the game offers, is a big part of the fun. But even at its core, The Binding of Isaac just gets right what every roguelike needs to get right: the element of surprise when you play, and the degree of difficulty being just enough to make success feel extremely rewarding.There’s also some clever things you can do with the game’s systems. For example, the “Whore of Babylon\" ability will turn you into a more powerful demon form when you have limited life. Some items and rooms will reduce your permanent health in exchange for perks including more of the temporary spirit hearts, along with devil hearts that do damage to all enemies in the room when you take hits. But what you could do is use the health reductions to your advantage to  stay down at the demon-triggering health (this is especially useful for the character Eve, who starts off with Whore of Babylon) for the entire game. There’s all sorts of clever combinations that you can find and experiment with. Or, just utilize the Rebirth wiki, which has a ton of information compiled by the nerds who obsess over this sort of thing, and save yourself a lot of time. The nice thing about diving into Rebirth now is that a lot of the cool secrets have been found and compiled for you to use for yourself.So how about the controls? I will say that they work quite fine, but that a physical controller is the optimal way to play Rebirth. You get two movement options, #1 being analog movement and #2 being digital movement. The firing is generally cardinal directional, and by default it’s continuous fire, though this can be disabled. This all generally is functional, but for a game where doing well is heavily dependent on tight timing moments, well, I could see where some people would have issues. I’d consider the touch controls for this game more of a convenience factor than the main way that you should play, perhaps. But who knows, I’m sure someone’s going to start pulling off amazing runs without a controller. The portrait mode options are clever additions. On iPad, it’s particularly cool because it makes it a bit more comfortable to hold a medium or large iPad with two hands. And with that, you get the advantage of having the map and action buttons displayed on the bottom of the screen, Nintendo DS style. On iPhone, I don’t really see the utility so much, but it’s there if you want it!Thankfully, there is controller support! One thing I particularly like is that you can turn a controller on during the game and use it right away. This sounds like a strange thing to mention, but other games with MFi support often require you to quit and reload them  to get your controller support properly working. If you have a Gamevice, this might be a perfect use case for one. This is arguably the best-running version of Rebirth, too: Nicalis has claimed that this is the only portable version consistently running at 60 frames per second. And unlike the Vita/3DS versions, Afterbirth is a possibility, though it will depend on how well Rebirth iOS does.While there has been some drama from iOS gamers on the $14.99 price point, look at it this way: it’s the exact same price for the game on every other platform. And while the DLC of Afterbirth and Afterbirth+ aren’t available yet, you get the exact same content that you would get if you bought the game on Steam. And with a controller, you get an identical experience, plus 2-player co-op if you have multiple controllers. The iOS port has iCloud sync between devices (though unfortunately a manual upload/download functionality), and will get Apple TV support soon. It might be the best port of the game yet, and certainly the most versatile.If you’re playing just with the touchscreen, this might not be the optimal way to play The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, but there’s still so much here to discover that you should check it out even if you don’t have a controller. The emergent gameplay is second-to-none, and the sheer number of secrets is massive. No game will give you more to find and discover than The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth will. This could conceivably be the only game you play for the rest of the year, considering how much time you’d have to spend to be good at the game, and then unlocking everything there is to see in Rebirth. And it’s a ton of fun along the way. It took a long time to get here, but enjoy this one, folks.",
      "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a game featured in Game Theory.The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a 2014 independent rogue-like game designed by Edmund McMillen, and developed and published by Nicalis. The player controls a young boy named Isaac whose mother, convinced she is doing the work of God, strips him of all his clothes and possessions and locks him in his room. With his mother about to sacrifice him, Isaac escapes to the basement and fights through randomized dungeons created in a roguelike fashion. The player defeats monsters using Isaac's tears as bullets, and collects items that improve Isaac's attributes and abilities. Eventually the player must face Isaac's mother, and later even more demonic creatures.

      "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's storyline is based off the eponymous Bible story. Isaac (a kid) and his mother live in a small home situated on a hill, both peacefully keeping to themselves, with Isaac drawing doodles and playing with his toys while his mother watches Christian broadcasts on the television. Isaac's mother then hears \"a voice from above\", stating her son is corrupted with sin and must be saved. It asks her to remove all sin from Isaac to save him. She obliges, taking away his toys, pictures, his handheld video game console and even the clothes on his back.The voice again calls out to Isaac's mother, stating Isaac must be isolated from all the evil in the world. Once again, she follows its command and locks Isaac in his room. Finally, the voice speaks to her again. It states she has done well but says it still questions her faith and commands she must sacrifice Isaac. She obliges, grabbing a kitchen knife and goes to Isaac's room. Isaac is watching through a sizable crack in his door and starts to panic. He finds a trapdoor under the rug, and just as his mother bursts in, he opens the trapdoor and jumps down it. The game then transitions to the title screen.Shown throughout the game at loading points between floors is Isaac recollecting about his childhood while curled up in a fetal position and crying. These purportedly show parts of his life, showing Isaac had a difficult childhood ranging from rejection from his mother to bullying from his classmates. However, some images show impossible scenes that cannot have happened but are rather Isaac's own fears. Along with that, the game resumes with Isaac waking up on the next floor making it possible that the memories are merely made up dreams.The game has an epiloge and 16 ending scenes, making the storyline distorted and non-linear as the game continuesThis game contains....Binding of Isaac: Rebirth{{{gameart}}}{{{caption}}}Distribution:\n{{{distribution}}}Designers:\nEdmund Mcmillen\nNicalisComposer:\n{{{composer}}}Platforms:\n{{{platforms}}}Release Date:\n4th of November 2014Genre:\n{{{genre}}}Mode:\n{{{mode}}}",

Mystic Runes Upgradeable shopsVersion 1.1First released version.I've been a fan of Binding of Isaac for around 6 years now. I bought the original, clocked it, bought Rebirth, clocked it, Afterbirth, clocked it. I thought the game'd be great when ported to iOS and voila, here it is. First of all, this game is fantastic. If you're remotely interested or if you've played Binding of Isaac before, buy this game. It is a great experience well worth the money for all the fun you can get out of it. The game looks beautiful, runs beautifully and it keeps the classic charm of Rebirth. The UI is incredibly well optimised for iOS which is something I can seriously appreciate. There's really only one thing I want to see in a future update (well, aside from Afterbirth DLC ;D) is a D-Pad or a joystick system with a constant location. I'm not a huge fan of how the base of the 'joystick' moves and it can cause a lot of inconsistencies in movement and shooting. I'm sure you can get used to it but I feel it would be a nice option for those who prefer different types of controls. Overall, though, I give this game 5 stars because regardless of the controls, it is an incredible game. Thanks so much Ed McMillan and Nicalis!!~The controls feel loose compared to the pic version, I've had countless times of frustration where one side of the control scheme starts operating using the other side of the tablet, in a game which requires as much precision as the binding of Isaac this is a big deal, I find it harder to do precision movements than in the pic version, the game is pretty expensive for a port and doesn't include afterbirth, the achievements aren't in the game, there are unlocks but they are hidden in the settings, don't show any pop up on completion and take forever to go through, in saying all this I loved the pc iteration and this game is still better than practically anything else on the mobile market so I would still recommend the game but I feel the asking price is a bit ridiculous considering you can get GTA sa a much larger game in scope for almost half the price, the only reason I even considered spending this much money on a mobile port is because the binding of Isaac is my favourite game, if my problems with the port were alleviated I would almost feel justified in spending so much.It's Binding of Isaac, (almost) perfectly ported to iOS. Isaac is an amazing game that is by definition easy to learn, but hard to master. Randomly generated, with 100s of different items that shake things up, 50something bosses and 11 playable characters, it's well worth the money. If it's your kind of game, you could squeeze 100s of hours out of this. If not, it's still quite enjoyable. It does exactly what it sets out to do, and it's almost perfect. The only problem, as suggested by many others, is the controls. The sticks are fiddly, and that's bad in a twin stick shooter, especially one that requires some quick movement and precise shooting. It's the only thug keeping me from giving it a perfect score.All in all, wait 'till they change the controls, then buy it first thing after they do.",
      "When an inconspicuous voice declares that her son has become corrupted by sin, the devout faith of Isaac’s mother is put to the test when she is warned that he needs to be saved. Removing his clothes, toys and belongings as evil influences, Isaac is locked away in his room… but that isn’t enough for the malevolent voice whom she believes to be God. In order to prove her love and devotion to the bellowing voice she must sacrifice Isaac, who, petrified at his mother’s sudden violent turn, escapes through a trap door to the basement.The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth will forever be remembered as the game that Nintendo had once denied, an internal debate at the company having raged over its “questionable religious content.” But, years later, it becomes the game’s eventual release now represents Nintendo’s relaxed stance toward which content it welcomes on their Nintendo eShop.It has been a long road to The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth‘s eventual release on New Nintendo 3DS, but it is easy to recognise where Nintendo’s initial concern lay. Cast into the hellish nightmare that the basement hides, Isaac wanders naked and is left to defend himself with the tears that unrelentingly stream down his face. Faced with monsters that range from deceased babies that cry blood-ridden tears, slithering maggots and brains, the horrors that Isaac must conquer results in an unsettling world to explore.Reworked from the game’s original Flash version, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth‘s warped sense of reality is meticulously crafted by Nicalis and creator Edmund McMillen. Successive patches have ironed out troubling issues that plagued the game’s Nintendo eShop launch, and we have now reached a point where The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth delivers a robust experience on a handheld that matches counterparts on other platforms.As a top-down action-orientated shooter, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth presents initial similarities to trawling through dungeons in classic The Legend of Zelda adventures. However, being procedurally generated means that no two runs will be the same. You only have one chance to make it through The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth‘s increasingly tricky depths, an early demise in the blood-soaked halls sending you back to the title screen where you must start your scurry for survival over again.It can seem punishing, but we wouldn’t have it in any other way. Players are steadily rewarded with bombs, cards and pills that will strengthen Isaac’s resolve, although it can be seen as a gamble as some pills risk weakening you. There’s enough variance to allow each of your attempts to feel distinctly different from one another, and it never feels as if you’ve been cheated out of your progress.Controls are simple to grasp with players shuffling Isaac around with either the Circle or Control Pad while using the A, B, X and Y Buttons to fling salty tears in whichever direction required. L and R Buttons deploy bombs, cards and pills, while the additional ZL and ZR Buttons on the New Nintendo 3DS allow for methods to use items and dispose of anything unwanted that you have collected.The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth‘s pixel perfect visuals are somewhat chilling in their blood-soaked design, but the aesthetic and accompanying soundscape suit the horrifying surroundings in which Isaac finds himself.It may have inadvertently taken longer than expected, but The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth makes a welcome arrival on the Nintendo eShop. Those that can withstand the somewhat grim setting will find a particularly rewarding experience that will ensnare you for hours on end.As featured on Metacritic, GameRankings, OpenCritic and NewsNow."

      "Road Not Taken is an independent video game developed by Spry Fox for PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows and Mac. In a take on the Robert Frost poem of the same name, the game is described as being about life's surprises, both positive and negative.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nRoad Not Taken combines roguelike and puzzle game elements with the hopes of exploring unexpected surprises in accordance to the game's theme. As players explore, they will come across wild animals, impassable barriers, lost children and other objects. An object's use is not explained upfront, players are encouraged to learn about each object's use as they discover them, in traditional roguelike fashion.\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn development since at least 2013, the game was officially announced for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in August 2013. Developer David Edery cited recent games FTL: Faster Than Light and Don't Starve as inspirations for the game. Writing at the PlayStation.Blog, Edery explained the formulas the team used for creating the gameplay: randomness and hand crafted puzzles were used in conjunction.Spry Fox organized a competition asking fans to submit audio of what they think a \"spry fox\" would say, the winner would be used for an in-game spry fox character. Spry Fox showed the game at PAX East in 2014 before launching on August 5th.Despite the game's original announcement containing a release on PS Vita, that version of the game has not been released.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRoad Not Taken received mixed reviews from critics, with a score on review aggregator Metacritic of 70/100. Critics generally praised the art and themes, but were divided on the design choices. Writing for PlayStation LifeStyle, Dyani Wood felt the game \"proved to be a very unique game for its genre\" and concluded it's \"a great game to have in your PS4 library.\"In a mixed review for Game Informer, Matt Miller enjoyed seeing randomized puzzles with each playthrough, but felt the \"sense of repetition on similar (even if not identical) puzzles isn’t worth the trade-off.\" Others praised the random generation, but felt the game was too short.Some reviewers felt the game was an \"acquired taste\" and \"not for every gamer.\" Some pointed to the randomized gameplay management as a reason for this. Spry Fox responded to feedback on the game's difficulty, releasing a patch in December 2014 adding various fixes and gameplay additions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nSpry Fox website",

      "Road Not Taken is an original puzzle game about life and loss that is currently being developed by Spry Fox!  Adventure through a vast, ever-changing forest in the aftermath of a brutal winter storm. Will you find your way?Progress is coming along nicely and we are aiming to release Road Not Taken before the end of the year. But we’re getting excited now and wanted to share a few tidbits of what’s to come!  🙂  Apologies for being a bit of a tease.This game grew out of a variety of influences.   We borrowed the name and theme from Robert Frost’s 1916 poem “The Road Not Taken“.  The mechanics are reminiscent of an evergreen roguelike and should provide hundreds of hours of original gameplay.  The art, created by the amazingly talented Brent “Meowza” Kobayashi (previously the Art Director for the Glitch MMO) blends the puzzle rooms of Zelda with his own very personal storybook illustrations.For Daniel, the designer on the project, (and previously designer of Triple Town, Panda Poet, Leap Day and co-designer of Steambirds and Realm of the Mad God) this is one of the more personal games he has created. When you grow up, you are often told that there is a singular path through life; you go to school, you get a job, you fall in love and then you start a family. What happens when someone wanders far off that path? There’s no single answer to that question, but this game is an exploration of at least one answer. It’s also an experiment with a more pointillist approach to narrative, which we think is particularly well-served by the roguelike genre. Each object, each animation, and each bit of text is a bit of paint on the canvas. Over dozens of playthroughs, a greater theme will be revealed to players.Over the next couple months, we’ll share more progress on the game.  If you’d like to be kept in touch, please sign up for the Spry Fox newsletter, or follow us on Twitter or Facebook.Wow, that looks gorgeous. I’m so intrigued by the concept–can’t wait to play this!Awe-inspiring! Will be waiting.Looks great! Will this be a pc or mobile game?+1. What platform will this be on? I loved TT on iOS but I would totally play this on Steam or Vita.Oh boy. Do you want my money now, or will I have to wait?YES!Oh HELL yes!yay, am so hanging out for this!And yay –  raypup – another glitchen Refugee! I was Arietty on Glitch and same name in here…oops – I misspelt your name traypup!Arietty! I remember seeing you around! awww!Aww, the art is too reminiscent of Glitch! Goodnight Groddle.I’m excited for this! Shiren the Wanderer and Brogue are two of my favorite games of all time. I love that you’re exploring the multi-playthrough approach to narrative.Wow, very nice guys, graphics are delightful. Do you have any mailing list for notifying users when you launch? That would be great.Linux please 🙂I agree. Linux please.Mac please.Looks amazing, and this former glitch player can’t wait to try it! 🙂Awesomesauce… KUKUBEE!!!It’s so beautiful, and looks as though it may be a tribute to Glitch in a way. I will not be able to stay away from this game. Although, I may play it tearfully as I remember Glitch.So many Glitchen floating around the ether still…I was Dahlia DreadNaught, and can’t wait to find out more about this game…yay, Kukubee!",
      "In previous blog posts, we’ve talked about the procedural system we use to create the enchanted forests that serve as your proving ground in Road Not Taken. That system is what makes Road Not Taken a fun game to play repeatedly, and as with any good roguelike you’ll need to play RNT many times before you’ve stumbled upon every interesting object and creature lurking in the forest.But a purely random system, even a very rich one, can start to feel repetitive over time. Every snowflake might be unique, but after you’ve looked at a thousand snowflakes it’s easy to stop appreciating them! Our roguelike developer ancestors have invented a few solutions to this problem, one of which is to change the look and feel of the environment to signal when something new/important/dangerous is happening. Sewers transition into dungeons, dungeons become underground caverns, etc. And in Road Not Taken, peaceful glades might lead to blizzard-ravaged woods, haunted glades and dangerous ice caverns! The changing terrain is both a marker of your progress as well as a warning of new challenges to come.Another classic component of roguelikes (and other procedurally-generated games) are hand-crafted encounters and setpieces. These uncommon encounters stick out like a sore thumb precisely because they’re not 100% randomly generated. They’re specialized, memorable moments that punctuate the gameplay experience. The Chess Biome in Don’t Starve is an example of a setpiece. The major boss encounters in Diablo are another example.In Road Not Taken, pretty much all of the setpieces that we’ve recently created are hand-crafted puzzles that demand careful planning if you want to solve them efficiently (and remember, in this game, inefficiency equals death!) They aren’t completely non-random puzzles, since that would limit their replay value, but they’re non-random enough to be very distinctive.We’re hoping to launch with a healthy variety of these setpieces. Some might have that good-old “boss encounter” feeling to them. And more often than not, those bosses won’t just be coming after you — they’ll be hunting the children you’re sworn to rescue. Protecting others from harm can often feel more intense than just trying to save yourself.We’ve been spending a lot of time thinking about and testing new setpiece ideas over the past couple weeks. It’s been a lot of fun, and we have way more ideas than we’ll ever have time to implement! But even so, it’s worth noting that all of this stuff is just icing on our procedurally-generated cake. The hand-crafted content won’t be the defining feature of your many journeys through Road Not Taken, but we really hope it’ll provide some memorable moments along the way. 🙂And hey, I saved the best for last. Here’s a new video showing lots of cool new, never-seen-before stuff from the game, including one of our new setpiece puzzles!-Chedd",
      "Hi everyone! Brent here again. We’ve gotten a lot of questions and compliments about the look of Road Not Taken’s main character, so I thought you might enjoy reading about the process I went through in creating it!First, I guess I should say that designing a game’s main character/avatar is always tricky. The avatar has to work as a functional asset within the context of the game, has to look good in marketing materials and screenshots, but most importantly, has to feel right as something that represents you, the player! Easier said than done.In Road Not Taken, the main character is a forest ranger of sorts (who happens to be blessed with mystical powers of levitation.) Although the theme of the game superficially calls for it,  I knew right off the bat that I didn’t want to go with a typical “park ranger” motif. The forest of Road Not Taken is mysterious and enchanted, and I wanted the Avatar to have the same vibe. So instead, I drew inspiration from more delightful/whimsical figures. Some of my key inspirations include:The general look of the avatar hasn’t changed a whole lot from its earliest sketches to its current iteration. I knew I wanted the main character to be holding a staff to signal a “lone traveller” persona. And I knew s/he needed to be hooded to hide his/her gender, so everyone could identify with the main character.But when dealing with a character of such a stout stature that a tile-based game calls for, nailing down the overall shape of the character is everything. You could see by the early sketches and prototypes that the general theme and look of the character did not change through the process. Almost all of my sketches and concepts were iterations on the character’s head/hood shape and size. I was barely concerned about what was inside this silhouette until I was settled on the shape. In the end, I wanted the character to be whimsical — almost elven or wizard-like — yet still remain human in nature.The blue flame was one of the last elements I added to the design, and I did it for three reasons. One, to give him a signature element to elevate him from being just “some hooded dude”. Two, for thematic purposes, the flame acts as the character’s life meter. When the flame dies, so too does our hero. And three, because why not a blue flame?So, what’s under the main character’s hood??? We are currently experimenting with having the player reveal themselves to townsfolk. (Get your mind out of the gutter; I don’t mean it like that!) There are currently hundreds of possible avatar combinations, and we are working on allowing the player to have the option of fully customizing their character. Here’s a sneak peek at some of the possible combinations! Which one are you?I hope this glimpse into the artistic development process behind Road Not Taken has been interesting to you! If you have any other questions about the look and feel of the game, please leave me a comment and I’ll do my best to answer!Excellent, thanks for sharing this – really interesting!",
      "There is a repeated theme in our upcoming game, Road Not Taken.  The characters in our little northern town have all lived their lives according to the same plan: first you go to school, then you get a job, then you fall in love and finally you start a family.But life doesn’t always work out that way.I grew up expecting to live a very traditional Norman Rockwell-style life. We had a little house on a lovely winding road in rural Maine. I did well in school; checked all the official checkboxes. Then upon entering the real world, things fell apart.On the job front, I’ve been through multiple careers. My “safe” job at a large stable employer — the sort of job many people dream about — well, that was an incredibly bad fit for me.  I’ve joined sketchy start ups that failed. And some that succeeded. I’ve been fired for idly drawing pictures of planes inserted into bums.  I’ve been hired at double the salary because (as I learned later) I wore the right type of hat to the interview.I live in a tiny condo in a big city, not a house in the suburbs. There is no yard or golden retriever. A bit later in life than the movies would have had me believe, I did stumble upon an amazing love. Back on track!Then we found out that we can’t have or adopt kids.  It is complicated; all my various thoughts about this get tangled up with one another. I’ve now got a checkbox that will never be checked.At this point, I feel pretty far off the golden path.  And I’ve ended up with a lot of questions. Is it okay that I’m happy? Am I still a useful person?  When I’m 87 years old with full blown dementia, who will sign my drooling shell into the retirement home?Many of my friends are raising families. They are nesting in their perfect houses (with yards) and bonding over baby-induced sleep deprivation.  Their conversations revolve almost exclusively around sleep schedules and potty training. It is like watching a whole different life veer away from me. I woke up one day and realized, “Hey, that really is not my future.”A surprising number of people I know are in a similar place. Their current life is not quite the simple arc they imagined it would be as a kid. Real arcs buckle and twist. I hope we are all richer for it.So, back to Road Not Taken. It’s a game that puts you in the shoes of a person who has fallen off the standard path. You live alone, outside the village, and every season a new storm arrives. The people of the village need you. There are tragedies and small delights. There are unexpected events and decisions.You can try to live a perfect life.Take care,\nDanc.Sounds interesting. Might enjoy this article also on the theme: http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/17/the-referendum/Danc…your brief comments of life for you thus far is succinct yet says so much.  You give hope to folk with those words.  Indeed, life’s arc is full of lumps, bumps and twists.  Maybe that’s the challenge we are suppose to face and out of it come some amazing people that accomplish wonderful things.  I am eagerly looking forward to the release of this game.  I know many others like myself too are also chomping at the bit.  On the ‘children’ comment, can I just say that … although you may not be able to check that box, I know you will be able to find a way to at least colour it in somehow in a way that will be fulfilling for children who are not fortunate to have ‘stable’ family life .. I have belief in you :_0)  – Ok..enough mulch from me now…..!Beatiful, heartfelt words – I can so relate. Thanks for sharing and making us feel less alone.Where can I find this game?Ship this game! Your vision is clear, honest and heartfelt– I love ART! Show us!! 😀Thanks for sharing such personal insight into the Road Not Taken’s theme. I have a few check boxes I know I’ll never be able to cross off my list as well. It’s wonderful so much heart and thought went into your game and I’m very much looking forward to playing it!",
      "Chapter 18 of “The Road Not Taken” will include: shopping malls and waterfronts, phone calls and marble floors, orange boxes and Greyhound buses, movie nights, snowballs, rainforests, cherry pies and hidden booze stash. And a lot of cleaning. Literally cleaning. PS: Yes, this fanfic is still going, just the chapter is super long.

Hopefully, it will be ready pretty soon.I’m mid chapter 14 and even I usually don;t ask for your opinion (being a mean mofo like that) I’m torn between pushing the confrontation with Frank to chapter 15 and focus only family/Max business in chapter 14 or include it in chapter 14 to break the misery porn/fluff with some action.After chapter 14 we will dive into very dark times for Amberprice (no spoilers) and there will be limited fluff (hence the diabetes of chapter 13). I wanted to keep chapter 14 more fluffy since I know what’s coming. On the other hand, it wouldn’t be that engaging I guess (still way more tension that in chapter 13).Your opinion, my dear friends? How fast do you want to learn about some surprises regarding this issue?Chapter 15 of “The Road Not Taken” will include: broken wings, bold pirates, dark corners, little boys and scared girls, letters to open and doors to close, loaded guns and plastic swords, skeletons and treasures, new friends and ex-friends. Rachel and Chloe will also meet somebody who they did not expect to meet in their whole life.This is purely an AmberPrice series, with Chloe and Rachel trying to put their lives together, growing up as a couple with Max, Steph and the rest of the gang around, obviously in some kind of AU. Hardcore fluff with some mature content (you cannot write about AmberPrice without sex scenes) and vocabulary.Prologue: The Talk That Never Happenedhttp://archiveofourown.org/works/12746970https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12723554/1/The-talk-that-never-happenedChapter 1: On the Right Trackhttp://archiveofourown.org/works/12763707/chapters/29119263https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12730000/1/The-Road-Not-TakenChapter 2: Truth and Butterflieshttp://archiveofourown.org/works/12763707/chapters/29170716https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12730000/2/The-Road-Not-TakenChapter 3: You Start, You Finishhttp://archiveofourown.org/works/12763707/chapters/29240154https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12730000/3/The-Road-Not-TakenChapter 4: Sticks and Stoneshttps://archiveofourown.org/works/12763707/chapters/29304561https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12730000/4/The-Road-Not-TakenChapter 5: Thy Libertyhttp://archiveofourown.org/works/12763707/chapters/29413998https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12730000/5/The-Road-Not-TakenChapter 6: Pushhttp://archiveofourown.org/works/12763707/chapters/29557179https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12730000/6/The-Road-Not-TakenChapter 7: A Flash of Controlhttp://archiveofourown.org/works/12763707/chapters/29751213https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12730000/7/The-Road-Not-TakenChapter 8: Mirror Mirrorhttp://archiveofourown.org/works/12763707/chapters/30225168https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12730000/8/The-Road-Not-TakenChapter 9: The Secret Beneathhttp://archiveofourown.org/works/12763707/chapters/30808605https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12730000/9/The-Road-Not-TakenChapter 10: Receptionhttp://archiveofourown.org/works/12763707/chapters/31127316https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12730000/10/The-Road-Not-Taken",

      "As we’ve mentioned in previous blog posts, Road Not Taken has procedurally-generated levels. You get a completely new experience every time you venture into the forest. When designing a game like Bioshock or God of War, a designer must hand-select the placement of every corridor, every object, and every enemy in the game. With Road Not Taken, we’re not hand-selecting anything. We spend our time creating interesting objects and enemies and then carefully defining the probabilities of when and where you will encounter them.The process reminds me of Duchamp’s painting ‘Nude descending a Staircase, No. 2’. For thousands of years, humanity painted a single instant, captured in time. Duchamp, inspired by advances in motion pictures, decided to paint all the possible states of a woman walking down the stairs in a single painting. To me, designing a roguelike is a little bit like that. Instead defining a single level, we use algorithms to define all possible levels at once.Generating a level one pass at a timeThe level generation system builds each level by laying down multiple passes of increasing detail. Each pass tweaks the balance of the level and gets it a little bit closer to the final state that the player will experience in the game. A single generated level in Road Not Taken is built up out of five distinct passes.Pass one: Lay out the roomsIn Road Not Taken, the forests you’re adventuring through are a simple grid of grids. For example, a forest level might be a 3 by 4 grid of rooms, with each room occupying a single 6 by 8 tiled screen. One of the forest rooms – the top leftmost one – is labeled as the starting location.At this stage, we also set some constraints, such the the number of children you’ll rescue, the minimum number of parents on the map, and a targeted difficulty. These things shape the rest of the map.It seems simple, but selecting the right numbers is a slow and painstaking process. We have to find all the values that yield broken (or not-fun) levels and eliminate them. So I spend a large portion of my days setting various numbers really high or really low, and then play the resulting levels to see how they feel. Through this process of elimination I learn things, such as “collecting 100 children is a total drag.” But collecting just 1 child is boring, too. Is there something in the middle that works? Tweak by tweak, a fun experiences comes into focus.The exciting part when dealing with original game mechanics is that no one (myself included) knows what constraints will feel good. Sometimes the answers surprise me, so I try not to make too many assumptions. I just dig in, make hundreds of ugly levels, and explore the unknown in hopes of stumbling on something surprising and delightful.Pass two: Add blocked pathsEach room has an entryway that is blocked by boulders. That path can only be unblocked by a specific object that must be collected into a matching set by the player. For example, you might need to gather and group five trees of a certain type in order to unblock the passageway. We can, theoretically, make almost any object in the game (in any quantity) the key to these doors, though some end up being more fun than others.So we look at the target difficulty for the room, then look at the set of available lock objects, then pick one for a door. The lock objects are placed in the room with the door. We repeat this step till all the paths in the forest are blocked off.After we added this step during the prototyping phase, the game stopped being fun and we very nearly ceased to work on it. Unblocking the paths was a pleasant experience, but something subtle was missing. It just wasn’t fun enough.Pass three: Move some lock objects out of the roomsCristian Soulos, our lead programmer, figured out how to keep things interesting. He realized that Road Not Taken would be more fun if all the pieces you needed to solve a puzzle weren’t just sitting right in front you. So he spread the lock objects for some of the doors into different rooms. This forces you to search and explore the forest if you want to unblock every path and rescue every child. (I always imagine the computer giggling evilly at this step.)As soon as we added this to the level generation system, Road Not Taken went from being fun to play for 10 minutes to being fun to play for hours. The lesson here is that is also that when working on original game mechanics, it often isn’t obvious what will be fun up front.Pass four: Add goal objects and critical crafting ingredients to the roomsThis is the point where the children, parents and critical crafting ingredients are added to specific locations in the forest. Rescuing those children is your primary goal; they are what changes Road Not Taken from a fun toy into a game that you can win. Crafting ingredients increase your chances of success, if you use them correctly, by giving you tools to more efficiently explore the forest and deal with enemy creatures.Pass five: Add a dash of difficultyIn addition to the lock objects, we have challenge objects. These make your life more difficult by attacking, blocking, and/or confusing you. First we look at the target difficulty of the room, a simple number that increases as the player’s skill increases, and also increases over time. Then we fill up the rooms with objects and enemies that increase the forest’s difficulty till the target difficulty is met.Each object has an expected difficulty and some constraints on how many can appear in a level. Objects also have rules dictating what they shouldn’t appear next to, and how deep into the forest they generally appear.Not all objects show up all the time, so the player is forced to mix up their strategy. You may have started relying heavily on crafting potions, but on a map where the key ingredients for those potions don’t appear, you’ll need to use other tactics. Many objects in the forest have multiple uses, so you always have plenty of options, though you might need to experiment for a while to figure them all out.Some interesting benefits of our procedural level generatorThere’s a single difficulty slider: It takes a great deal of effort to tune it all correctly, but once we’ve done that, we can generate easier or harder levels with the change of a single number. I can testify that some of the harder forests in Road Not Taken are insanely brutal, even for me, the lead designer of the game. But they are also incredibly satisfying when you solve them!Robust in face of new content: A short while ago, we added 10 really unique new objects and enemies to Road Not Taken. If this was a more traditional game with levels that have been entirely handcrafted, a change of that magnitude would likely have required weeks of additional rebalancing and level reworking. But in our procedural system, with a few minor adjustments, everything just worked. So now we have lots of freedom to try out fun new ideas without losing all our old work, which means we can put dozens or even hundreds of interesting objects and enemies in the game. It also means that, with a little luck, we can do lots of interesting updates after Road Not Taken is released!The combinations continue to surprise me: There are trillions of different levels that can be generated within Road Not Taken. I’m constantly running across new scenarios that I wouldn’t have predicted. What happens when a raccoon spawns next to heavy stone blocks? Pure chaos… and not something I planned for.Keeping it fun for ourselves as well as youAs a game developer, a little-discussed secret is how often we get tired of our own games since we end up playing them over and over again for months (or years) before release. But Road Not Taken keeps surprising me, and I’m not tired of it yet. 🙂We just finished another balancing pass and the game is really shaping up. At this point, we probably have most of the objects and enemies that will be in the game by the time we launch. Now there’s just a ton of polishing and minor feature work left to go. With any luck, we’ll be ready to launch sometime this Spring or Summer!Take care,\nDancPS. In case you haven’t seen it, we recently released a new live action teaser trailer for Road Not Taken. Check it out!typo on the PS there Dan:  Road Naken.  Which also sounds like a fun game 😀",

Email support@spryfox.com!Rarely does a game throw us like Road Not Taken did—but in a good way. Its fairy-tale visuals made us think haunting adventure game, and that’s in there. The gameplay has puzzler-style matching, tough roguelike random levels and a town hub where you sweet-talk someone into marrying you. Unique, right? It takes a little getting used to, but we ended up fascinated by how it all comes together so beautifully.I first played Road Not Taken on Steam over a year ago and had a lot of fun with it. I think this is a good port to mobile, and a steal for a dollar in comparison.This is a puzzle game where the mechanic you use is picking up everything in the four tiles adjacent to you, and drop them, which will shove those objects to the farthest tiles in their directions until they hit another object or the forest wall. The challenge is figuring out how to minimize the moves you make to conserve energy, with a main goal to reunite children to mothers per \"room\" of the forest. Sometimes instead of children, you have to group objects together to open doors to the next room(s). And of course there are more enemies/obstacles as you progress that you have to plan around.A lot of people think this game is hard at first, and so did I. But then you really get into it once you start learning what objects and enemies do through experience. It does take some patience in that respect. But it is a really fun game for puzzle lovers, and would be great to take on-the-go.I'm on my fifth play-through. The puzzles started out very confusing, but it starts to make sense before long. And new discoveries along the way keep it interesting and make it more rewarding. (The controls also get much easier with practice.) I recently shifted to playing on Difficult mode, and that adds some new interest as well.Meanwhile, the world is delightful—I enjoy the art, the sweet and quirky interactions with villagers, and plying them with gifts until you can propose marriage. (You can marry the whole village if you want to, regardless of gender! I love it.) I haven't managed to get my character to have their own children yet, but I think it's possible. Altogether a charming game.FYI, it is not possible for your character to have kids. One of this game's themes is that life doesn't always turn out as you hope/expect (or as society hopes/expects of you), and the inability to have kids is one way we try to communicate this.",

      "In the rougelike game Road Not Taken, from development studio Spry Fox, you play as a ranger who lives near a small village. Although you are not a traditional townsperson, your skills are often called upon for a variety of services. comes from a poem by Robert Frost.This poem speaks to the heart of what this game is all about, a character who lives off the beaten path. It is something that the game’s creator is familiar with. I got the chance to interview the developers about this game, porting it to Android TV, and deeper into philosophy and culture than I intended.What was the original idea behind Road Not Taken?[Editor’s note: I was directed to a link for this question, so this answer is interpreted.]The developer’s life has been non-traditional, far from the expectations that are normally set in life. Along the way, he started to understand that many people have lives off the beaten path. In this game, you play as a person who doesn’t fit in with the normal expectations of the village. However, you still find a purpose and find meaning in helping the village. “You can try to live a perfect life.”How big was the development team? Was it split between graphics, programmers, and composers?For the main (PC) sku it was 2 engineers (expanding to 4 towards the end, during the final polish push), two designers, one artist, 2 QA folks, and 1 producer. Each of the port teams had their own engineers.How long did the development process take? What unexpected hurdles did you face?More than a year. Some of the unexpected hurdles came from the realization that while people don’t mind dying and starting over in most roguelikes, they really hated losing their progress in RNT. So we had to introduce an easy mode and a savepoint system, which we originally thought wouldn’t be necessary, to account for that. Another hurdle was that people really wanted the game to have a LOT more secrets, but when we added those secrets, they started to complain about difficulty learning and using them all. 🙂 That turned into a balancing act.Why did you decide to support Android TV?Because it was relatively easy, since the game already had a console version.I had some trouble playing the game on some controllers. How much work went into Android TV testing?As much work as we could manage. 🙂 We’re a very small studio with limited resources, and the large number of Android devices on the market makes it pretty much impossible for us to cover every base.What’s next for Spry Fox? Any new games in the works?We’re working on a sequel to Alphabear, a coop VR game for Daydream called “Beartopia”, and a bullet hell MMO for PC/Mac called “Steambirds Alliance”. 🙂 If folks are interested in learning more about any of those, they should follow us on twitter or facebook @spryfox! And of course, visit our website: www.spryfox.com.It’s a fascinating game and it makes you think deeply about each of our lives and our place in the world. As I comment, I had some trouble playing with one of the controllers, so I only got so far in the game. The game has generated a sort of intrigue since this interview, and I’ve been itching to play it more even though I’m pretty busy. If you have more free time than me, check out the game on Google Play. It’s $5 on Google Play.Nick Felker is a student Electrical & Computer Engineering student at Rowan University (C/O 2017) and the student IEEE webmaster.

      "Nuclear Throne is a top-down shooter roguelike video game by Vlambeer. Early prototypes of the game were distributed through Steam's early access program in 2013. Nuclear Throne was released on December 5, 2015, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita platforms, with an Xbox One release due in the future.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nNuclear Throne is a top-down shooter roguelike game. The game consists of two main game modes: single-player, and a local cooperative gameplay mode. There are also daily and weekly challenge modes, allowing the user to compete against other players via the Steam platform for the best score (determined by the number of kills in the playthrough), on the same set of randomly generated levels. The player controls one of a total of 12 characters, 10 of which must be unlocked through play. Two additional secret characters can only be played under special circumstances during play. Each character has an ability unique to them, adding an additional element to the gameplay. These abilities offered by the game for each individual character allow different play-styles to be achieved by the player and improve the variety and replay-value of the game. Secondary sprites or skins can also be acquired for the characters played, if the player completes special or secret tasks. The player progresses through the linear level structure until level 7-3, where the final boss, the Nuclear Throne, has to be defeated. After this, the player may choose to loop to the beginning of the game again with a greatly increased difficulty. The user may continue looping indefinitely until death.\nThe game resets upon death. Except for special weapons acquired in a hidden level and “crowns” retained until after defeating the final boss, anything acquired in one play-through does not carry over to the next. The game has a leveling system, where the player gains experience in the form of radiation pellets, or \"rads\", dropped by enemies, that allows to get different mutations and choose what would benefit the character the most out of a selection of four, randomly selected mutations.Upon mutating 10 times the player can choose a character-specific “ultra-mutation”. As well as the available mutations being randomly generated, the levels themselves are procedurally generated, with every playthrough having a unique set of levels for the user to complete.\nThe player starts with the basic revolver, but they may upgrade by taking weapons from red chests and collect more ammunition by opening yellow chests. The player can have two weapons equipped at any time, such as a shovel and an assault rifle. The weapons available to the player get increasingly advanced and powerful as the enemies become increasingly difficult and numerous. Weapons utilise different ammo types, with there being currently bullet, energy, shell, bolt, explosive and melee weapons. The user may also use powerful Ultra Weapons after reaching Level Ultra, following the completion of experience levels up to Level 9.\n\n\n== Development ==\nVlambeer's Jan Willem Nijman and Rami Ismail served as the game's designer and producer, respectively, and shared the development work. Paul Veer, who had previously animated Vlambeer's Super Crate Box, returned to contribute art to Nuclear Throne. The game's promotional art was drawn by Justin Chan, an art student hired on the basis of his fan art for early releases of the game. Nuclear Throne's music was composed by Jukio \"Kozilek\" Kallio, who had composed for several previous Vlambeer titles. A friend of Kallio's, Joonas Turner, worked on the sound effect design.Nuclear Throne development took 2.5 years, beginning in February 2013 and releasing into Steam Early Access that same year. During PAX Prime 2013 Vlambeer showed off the prototype for Nuclear Throne, Wasteland Kings, with five of the twelve characters playable in the prototype. After the release of Nuclear Throne to early access, this prototype was made for public download. It was revealed by Rami Ismail that the name change was due primarily to a trademark issue with inXile Entertainment. Vlambeer live streamed gameplay online for the public twice a week during development. Vlambeer announced PlayStation 4 and Vita releases at the December 2015 PlayStation Experience keynote.The game will see a limited physical release on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita through Limited Run Games.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn January 2016, Vlambeer teamed up with the subscription box company, IndieBox, to offer an exclusive physical release of Nuclear Throne. This limited collector’s edition included a themed USB drive with DRM-free game file, official soundtrack, instruction manual, Steam key, and various custom-designed collectibles.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nNuclear Throne has received positive reviews from critics, with the game's PS4 version scoring 82/100 on Metacritic, and the PC version 88/100.Alexander Chatziioannou of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4 out of 5 saying, \"Nuclear Throne is impeccably presented and tightly designed. There is enough variety in characters, upgrades and weapons to ensure that playthroughs never get repetitive and its visceral combat is a joy in itself.\" Jordan Devore from Destructoid rated the game a 8/10 saying, \"it's one of the hardest, most rewarding games I've ever played. But as satisfying as it can eventually become, I think it is far too demanding for its own good.\"IGN awarded it a score of 9.0 out of 10, saying \"Nuclear Throne is an enjoyably tough run-and-gun with tons of energy and variety to justify hours and hours of replays.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Nuclear Throne at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website",

      "You're probably aware of the massive flood of indie games on the market if you've paid any attention to the upcoming, released, and Early Access games lists on Steam over the past year. There's a ton, and believe you me most of them are not worth your time.Nuclear Throne was on my radar for ages because it looked like my kind of game: fast-paced, brutal, and random. I wanted a game to fill the void Risk of Rain left in my guts after I got to the point it just wasn't challenging anymore -- outside of runs using excessive Artifacts. I played that game for 120+ hours, both solo and with friends, and I don't regret it.So here's Nuclear Throne, this roguelike-like that frankly looks amazing and I want it but it's Early Access so I let it sit. I've been burned on Early Access too many times just like every other Steam user who generally prefers indies over AAAs. Even if it looked like just what I wanted, I was willing to wait. And the wait was worth it.Nuclear Throne is one of those games you repeatedly slam yourself into until you get good enough to make some actual progress. After having bashed your beautiful, innocent face into the unforgiving and ugly wasteland, you come out black and blue and just a little bit better at surviving each time. You can hope you'll one day come out unscathed, but... what's the fun in that?One can't help but draw a parallel between it and indie darling The Binding of Isaac. Not only because of both games' brutality againstÂ the player, but because the gameplay itself.Both have the player run around randomized areas trying desperately to get strong enough to stay alive as everything else around them quickly becomes overwhelming, and both are top-down view action games with their toes dipped in shmups and twin stick shooters.Aside fromÂ these similarities,Â Nuclear Throne is unique. Players get stronger as they progress in a run via picking up weapons and choosing one mutation (like a perk or buff) per character level up. Once you die, weapons and mutations are lost and it's time to try again.Your progression is pretty much lost when you die in Nuclear Throne, but there are permanent unlockables that are well-worth the effort and getting them is extremely satisfying.The first sign of permanent progression is character unlocks. The first few unlocks come quick and easy with Eyes, Melting, and Plant; but the rest requireÂ effort from new players.It can and will take time for anyone new to the game to unlock every character. But that's not even the most effort-intensive progression to be had here. Golden Weapons and Crowns that offer benefits (and often detractors) can be unlocked per character to be used from the start of the game.Why would you want progression in this type of game anyway? Because otherwise there wouldn't be much incentive to play before you're good enough to loop multiple times.Looping is a common term among roguelike-likes that refers to getting to the \"end\" of the game, then choosing to restart with your current character, weapons, and upgrades for the added challenge and additional content. Many of Nuclear Throne's secrets are hidden behind at least one loop.There's a ton to be said about the details developer Vlambeer has thrown into the game, but many of those are better left to the player to see for themselves.Nuclear Throne's gameplay is paired with some amazing music and sprites that do more than get the job done. It's clear a lot of love was put into the game and it's a joy to both play and see in action. My one complaint is the lack of online multiplayer. The game's local co-op does its job, but I can only imagine how much more fun (and popular) it could be if you could play online with friends.Indie gaming is bigger than ever and unfortunately for the gameplay > all crowd who primarily stick to indies, retro, and difficult larger releases it's gotten harder to find real gems among what's available on Steam and console storefronts. There's more available out there, but it's not easy to trust what you find. You can definitely trust this one.I was more than pleasantly surprised by the overall quality of Nuclear Throne than I'd like to admit, and it's one title I wish I had purchased during Early Access. Now, nearly two months after its full release, I can confidently say this is one of the best games of the genre and sits on its own bloodied throne among the many other great roguelites and roguelike-likes we've gotten these past few years.",
      "ICAN, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, has made significant progress in the last year, but according to core member Akira Kawasaki the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize winning coalition is just getting started.ICAN, based in Geneva and launched in 2007, now has around 450 partner organizations in nearly a hundred countries. The process of building itself into a force for peace has had its challenges, but on July 7 last year, this “grass-roots civil society coalition” took one big step toward its mission of “worldwide nuclear disarmament,” Kawasaki said in an interview. On that day in New York, after years of persuading other countries to support the endeavor, ICAN worked with the United Nations and passed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, initially supported by over 135 countries.In order for the treaty to become international law, however, it must be signed and ratified by at least 50 nation-states. So far, 60 nations have signed the treaty but only 14 have officially integrated the treaty into their constitution. None of the world nuclear powers have joined and neither has Japan, which relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella.Millions will recognize the 73rd anniversary on Monday of that horrific morning in Hiroshima. Public support for the treaty is strong in Japan, with over half of the municipalities pledging their support. The Japanese government, however, has decided to take a passive stance on the matter, stating that “since no nuclear weapon states are involved, the treaty is not practical … (instead) Japan will bridge the divide.”Kawasaki disagrees. “The uniqueness of the treaty was that it prohibited nuclear weapons on humanitarian grounds.” Since Japan is the only country in the world to have experienced the inhumane nature of nuclear weapons on its own soil, “Japan should take the lead in advancing this humanitarian discourse,” he said. By not signing the treaty, Kawasaki believes the government is “undermining the credibility of Japan as a nation.”According to Kawasaki, it is only a matter of time until ICAN’s treaty achieves the 50-nation requirement. Ninety days after that final nation-state signature, the treaty will officially replace the Cold War-negotiated 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The irony of the name is not lost on Kawasaki, since the half-century-old agreement actually “perpetuated” the proliferation of nuclear weapons and caused nations such as India, Pakistan and North Korea to go rogue — or, in Kawasaki’s words, “mirror” the behavior of the United States and Russia — and set up their own nuclear weapons programs.Once ICAN’s treaty becomes international law, the pressure will then shift to countries such as the U.S. and Russia. “In the past,” Kawasaki says, “nuclear weapons were a symbol of power. But now, with a treaty that rejects compromise, nuclear weapons will be a symbol of shame.” Economic sanctions can be enforced, and banks could begin a divestment process similar to what occurred after the Convention on Cluster Munitions Treaty was put into effect in 2008. Kawasaki also mentions the “Don’t Bank on the Bomb” campaign, and says that since the signing of the treaty, “as many as 30 banks ceased to invest in nuclear weapons producers.”As of Sunday, ICAN had secured the ratification of their treaty from Mexico and Austria — the 15th- and 28th-ranked GDP economies in the world, respectively — and Brazil, which is ranked ninth, has also signed to indicate its support. In order for the treaty to gain any traction as far as future sanctions are concerned, ICAN is going to need the help of countries such as Japan, the third-largest economy, if they are to continue to have success.In order for the Japanese government to change its stance, Kawasaki believes several factors will need to be addressed — the first being the continued nuclear disarmament of North Korea. “If both North and South Korea join the treaty, the North will feel obliged to disarm, and the South will be bound by law not to deploy, keep or assist U.S.-related nuclear weapons.” While Kawasaki welcomes the recent peace talks between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, he said “international law will bind the country to their commitment.”Kawasaki urges anyone who lives in a country that has not signed the treaty to spread the word and become involved in their local city councils. In Japan, especially, it will take a grass-roots effort to change what some see as a one-sided government approach. “A vast majority of Japanese people believe they are victims,” Kawasaki says, “and we are calling for a nuclear-free world. But when you look at the behavior of the government … it shows that they are considering the issue only superficially.”Click to enlargenuclear weapons, Nobel Prize, ICAN, akira kawasaki",
      "This November, Dutch art dealers and publishers Cook & Becker will release a new book, 120 Years of Vlambeer & Friends, subtitled \"Bringing back arcade games since 1896\", chronicling the first six years of the titular indie studio, responsible for such indie successes as Ridiculous Fishing, LUFTRAUSERS and Nuclear Throne. The studio's co-founders, Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman, have opened up their archive to present a vast amount of original artwork and concept-stage designs to complement the words.Waypoint is pleased to publish a chapter from the book here, focusing on the release and reception of hit mobile app Ridiculous Fishing—a game that emerged from the troubled waters of a cloning scandal—and moving into the development of the singularly styled shooter LUFTRAUSERS, a game that would go on to be a little controversial itself.Above: Artwork from 'Ridiculous Fishing'. All imagery courtesy of Vlambeer/Cook & BeckerMarch 2013 saw the much-anticipated launch of Ridiculous Fishing on iOS, now titled Ridiculous Fishing: A Tale of Redemption. The subtitle referred to the backstory the team gave to the fisherman himself, Billy, which turned out to be the tale of his father, who'd been lost at sea. It was a sad story, available to those players who made it through to the end, brought to life in a (digital) comic by artist Maré Odomo. But it was equally evocative of Vlambeer's ordeal in bringing the game to completion, as well. Gaming websites gave it near-perfect scores at launch, with a smattering of 10-out-of-10 marks. The cloning situation was mentioned in most reviews, but journalists made clear scores were not dependent on development history: The biggest compliments pointed out the intricate balancing of the three mini-games and the stunning visual and game design.Priced at $2.99, Ridiculous Fishing wasn't cheap in comparison to other paid apps, or in terms of what many mobile gamers understood as representing value, but Vlambeer wanted to make a statement: After the many months of development hardship, and as a reflection of the depth of the game, they simply thought it warranted the price. The gaming audience agreed in droves: Sales went through the roof from day one, lifting the game to the number one position on Apple's paid app rankings in several market territories for weeks on end. Vlambeer's financial worries, already soothed through the Super Crate Box sales, vanished for a few years.And gamers not only bought the game, but played it ferociously, working their way through to the story's ending while seriously collecting marine life for their personal 'fishopedia', too. In doing this, they uncovered a problem Vlambeer chose to resolve in the game's first update. Hunting specific types of fish in specific parts of the levels failed when you hooked another type of fish, after which you had to reel in your line before you could start again. To remove the annoying waste of time, Vlambeer added a knife to Billy's inventory, to cut the fishing line at any point and bring the player back to the start position.Above: Artwork from 'Ridiculous Fishing'Ridiculous Fishing's successes did not stop in March. It received an Apple Design Award in June, recognized as one of the outstanding apps for that year. In August, Vlambeer announced the game was close to 300,000 sales, which translated to a million US dollars in gross revenue. After the success on Apple's iOS platform, Rami, Jan Willem, Zach and Greg reunited to port the game to Android, Google's competing operating system for mobile devices, launching the game on the Google Play store in November. In December, it was named Apple's iPhone Game of the Year, winning praise for its 'great controls, hugely rewarding challenges, and vibrant retro-style graphics'. More awards and nominations would follow, from a second Dutch Game Award (for 'Best Mobile Game') to the BAFTA Games Awards in the UK (in the 'Mobile & Handheld' category) in 2014. Redemption took its time, but when it came, it came in full.Meanwhile, other things were cooking as well. Back in 2011, Vlambeer had released the simple Flash game Luftrauser for free online, not expecting much from it after it failed to find a proper buyer. Yet when they checked player statistics, they saw that it far outperformed [previous free game] Dinosaur Zookeeper, a game advertised through Adult Swim and (Time Warner sister company) Cartoon Network. Soon, ideas emerged about expanding the dogfighting game into something larger. Early ideas about a sequel gelled when they talked to Nigel Lowrie, their contact at Serious Sam HD publisher Devolver Digital. Lowrie advised bringing the game to consoles, and offered to be Vlambeer's publisher again, funding some of the development costs and taking on part of the marketing when the game was ready.The development team for what would become LUFTRAUSERS was JW and Rami, plus Paul Veer (who did the original art on Luftrauser) and Roy Nathan de Groot, who would collaborate with Paul on art and animations. Jukio Kallio, responsible for Luftrauser's music, was engaged to expand on his original audio ideas. Much of 2013 was used to flesh out initial ideas for a larger version of Luftrauser. At the center of this two-dimensional game was a small airplane—the 'luftrauser'—twirling through the skies over a body of water, dodging bullets and strafing enemy ships. The plane was extremely simple in design, just a hull and a wing in a sand-brown silhouette, but had a lively appearance through an optical trick Jan Willem applied to the sprite animation. As the plane changed course, its body and wing scaled: To the human mind, this translated to a dynamic, three-dimensional airplane rotating around its axis. This key feature informed all art design decisions: the trick only worked if the backgrounds were not too complex. Instinctively, Paul Veer decided on a palette inspired by Nintendo's Game Boy, that just used four colors: a beige for the background, white for bullets and clouds, sand brown for the plane, and a dark, brownish red for enemy ships and airplanes.Above: Artwork from 'LUFTRAUSERS'Moving from Luftrauser to LUFTRAUSERS, Paul and Roy knew a fully fleshed out new game required something more, graphically. To enliven the action they chose four intermediate colors—reds, browns and orange—carefully keeping to the minimalist aesthetic of the first game. Jan Willem and Rami took up coding the game for PlayStation and PC—and ran into an interesting challenge. 'We made a deal not to play the original [Luftrauser] until the new version was as good as we remembered the original to be,' Rami wrote in a postmortem on the PlayStation blog in March 2014. 'We were surprised at how much of a struggle that was. We added bigger explosions, we worked on a dynamic camera system, we added trails of smoke on crashing jets. [Yet] it still took us almost a month to achieve the same level of speed, of chaos, and of impact that the far simpler original had.'Satisfied with the initial results, the team discussed the game's theme. The color scheme and the dogfighting of the original game vaguely suggested 20th century warfare, yet the new game was in need of something deeper. The movement of the airplane defied the laws of gravity, and could dive, submerge and shoot out of the water, far exceeding the technical possibilities of any conflict of the proposed period. The Luftrauser itself obviously was a 'superweapon', the team agreed, belonging to the realm of the imagination rather than to reality, and to a historic era of superpowers spying on one another, looking for evidence of fantastic weaponry like submerging airplanes, flying fortresses and armed dolphins. Picking up on this, Roy suggested looking into 1960s television series like Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, which found their inspiration in the same Cold War tensions, rumors of technically advanced spy planes and secret missions Vlambeer was looking at. This settled the theme: LUFTRAUSERS would be about the player being the best fighter pilot in the world, blasting through dogfights in their superweapon in an alternate history, and with Thunderbirds-like puppets instead of humans.The first release date for LUFTRAUSERS had been 'spring 2012'. Eventually it would launch two years later, in March 2014. Part of the delay was due to work on Ridiculous Fishing, yet another factor was Vlambeer's development practice: You take a small, fun idea, and see where it takes you. In the case of LUFTRAUSERS, the fun idea took the team to writing code and drawing assets for a customizable airplane that had up to 125 variations, and a need to playtest each and any possible combination. It also meant adding and tweaking more attack combos, and making more music: Jukio split up his audio tracks and attached new layers to certain Luftrauser parts. If a player changed a part of their airplane, part of the music would change with it (for example, a melodic or rhythmic layer), leading to potentially hundreds of 'remixes'.Above: Artwork from 'LUFTRAUSERS'In itself, these expansions were quickly executed, finished in months. Yet many months more were needed for programming menus and porting the game, as Vlambeer wanted to launch it simultaneously across different platforms. Eventually, the game would be available on PC and Mac computers (through Steam), on Android mobile devices (which launched in December 2014), and also on game consoles: Sony's PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Vita, its handheld system. Adding the latter to the launch platforms required months of additional quality assurance testing: tweaking, adjusting, and reprogramming stuff to meet Sony's certification requirements. It meant lots of additional work, and the team had to face a steep learning curve to learn their way around Sony's operating system, but being on the two PlayStation systems was of incredible importance to all involved. For years, consoles had been 'high walled gardens' for small games companies, with only a handful of lucky studios finding their way onto the green distribution pastures like Microsoft's XBLA, Nintendo's WiiWare and Sony's PlayStation Network (PSN). Able to digitally distribute games to consumers before those same channels opened up through app stores and desktop computers, console platforms held the high ground for years, the huge corporations behind them setting the terms for smaller companies who wanted in.By 2013, the balance of power had completely shifted. Longstanding practices that hampered indies—things like 'parity clauses' that forbade studios to offer their game on one platform when it had already launched with another—were retracted. Platform owners, realizing they needed larger game libraries to compete with new platforms on mobile and desktop computers, reached out to indies to talk about upcoming projects—a situation that simply never happened before. Vlambeer was one of the first studios to benefit from this new proposition, and enjoyed the refreshingly informal approach corporate companies adopted. 'A funny anecdote I love telling is how we signed LUFTRAUSERS to Sony,' Rami remembered:\"We were in a bar with [Sony Europe's then head of Strategic Content] Shahid Ahmad and he basically wrote the contract on a coaster and said, 'So, what do you need, and what do you want?' We discussed it, and within a week we had everything we needed to start developing. We got the contract the day after we got the [development computer] hardware, not the other way round, like 'Sign this and then…' No, this was just that he trusted us, and we trusted them. Done.\"Back in the day, platform holders were a necessity. You needed them. What's changed is, now they are a convenience, because the games are the stars. There are millions of games coming out, but having many games on your platform is a valuable thing.\"(Rami Ismail, talking to vg247.com, 2013)120 Years of Vlambeer & Friends is written by Arjan Terpstra and available to order here.Follow Waypoint on Twitter, like us on Facebook, and check us out on all manner of other socials here.Email is a thing.Catch new episodes of Waypoint Radio every Friday and Monday.",

      "I feel like most reviews of Nuclear Throne would start with the words “I hate you”, and this one is no different. I hate you, Nuclear Throne. You’re an unhealthy relationship that I can’t find my way out of. Time and time again I feel like things are going really well and then you slap me down and remind me that reality is here to ruin the day. I’m not good enough for you, I’m not what you deserve but damn it I’m going to keep trying until you accept me for who I am!This is the kind of emotion that Nuclear Throne evokes from me when I play it. It’s a top-down roguelike shooter with procedurally generated levels, incredible depth, and a difficulty scale that will make players throw controllers. Made by the folks at Vlambeer, known for Ridiculous Fishing and Super Crate Box, Nuclear Throne sports a pixel-esque look that seems to be more fitting to a mobile device than a console or PC, but still manages to work well on both. Players choose from a roster of mutants that have different special abilities, drop into a world populated by enemies, pick up different weapons, and kill said enemies using dual joystick aiming and the trigger for firing.The controls, at first, feel odd. Moving and shooting with two joysticks is nothing new but you don’t shoot with the right joystick, you just aim. On the PC you can use a mouse and keyboard and from what I’ve played of the PC version I have to say that it’s the way to play. Unfortunately, the mouse and keyboard give you expert-level precision that you just can’t get from the PS4 controller. This makes the PS4 version feel sub-par when compared to its bigger brother. The reason for that precision being such a big deal is that Nuclear Throne is filled with a lot of enemies and bullets.After the fourth level the game really starts to pick up. You have enemies coming at you from every direction and they’re all firing weapons, too. That means you’re doing your best bullet-hell dodging while also taking cover and firing back when you can. The left trigger is reserved for special abilities that are unique to each character. These simplistic controls ensure an easy pick-up-and-play experience with a ridiculous learning curve if you want to get good at the game. With a mouse and keyboard, Nuclear Throne is still challenging, but it feels more doable than with a controller. There are times when the PS4 controller feels like it can’t keep up, though thankfully that is not often enough to be too big of a detriment. Still, if you consider yourself a hardcore player of these kinds of rougelikes, I suggest you pick up the PC version.To take care of all those nasty enemies you have a large arsenal of different weapon types. Some shoot bullets, some shoot shells, others shoot explosives and still more shoot energy. The different ammo types encourage different play styles and I found myself adjusting and adapting depending on what guns I found in the world on a playthrough. On one run I was completely comfortable with my revolver and shotgun combo, which is rather basic and typically only available in early goings. On other playthroughs I made it a point to get a grenade launcher and precise lightning pistol to vary up my chances of success. The different weapons give the game legs by way of varied runs, an important quality in roguelike games. Most of the weapons I found in my time with the game were great; I only ever disliked one type of weapon and those were the crossbows, which just weren’t for me. Melee weapons also exist, and watching someone pull off a successful melee run is a thing of beauty.To make special runs like a melee run possible, Nuclear Throne has “mutations” that take place when you collect enough experience points, or rads. Mutations grant abilities such as damaging enemies that touch you, regenerating ammo or health upon killing an enemy, or an additional four hit points. Each ability has its uses and some abilities I thought to be useless turned out to be incredibly important to a successful run. I highly suggest watching some YouTube videos on the game to see what type of builds work for your play style.Just the fact that Nuclear Throne has these build options is a testament to its hidden depth. At first, I thought the game was a simple matter of kill enemies, get more health power-ups, and try not to die. Over time I realized how different combinations of mutations could really change the game entirely. On one play through, for instance, I finished a handful of levels without firing a weapon or swinging a melee weapon. On another run, I went for movement abilities and became an untouchable ninja of death and chaos.Nuclear Throne plays by its own rules and they’re for the player to find out. Some enemies explode upon death, killing you instantly if you’re too close. Other enemies play dead and pop up at the last minute to end your run in a flash. These rules also apply to the diversified roster of player characters. The large roster of mutants means you’ll have plenty of choices and each one can pull off useful abilities. Crystal, who starts with higher health than the other mutants and can turn into a crystal that deflects bullets for a short time, is a great starter character. Other characters like Melting are for the more hardcore as it doesn’t have as many hit points but can make corpses explode and gains XP at a faster rate.There’s a great sense of style in Nuclear Throne and its one that gets realized to the fullest degree. Every enemy and asset feels like it belongs in whatever world you’re playing in, whether it’s a desert, an icy tundra, or a pyramid cyclops’ mansion. The only time the game felt iffy was when it slowed down during massive explosions. These momentary slowdowns felt awful in a game that requires precision and control at every turn. Luckily, they never seemed to be a problem when I was mid-run and were never responsible for a death. Nuclear Throne is a tough but fair roguelike, that much is true. My other odd gripe with the PS4 version is the pause menu. The pause menu defaults to the main menu button as the button you’d press if you were to press X. Typically if I pause mid-run it’s because I needed to answer a call or let someone in. If I didn’t remember to move the cursor to “Continue” I would accidently hit X and be sent back to the main menu without any “Are you sure you want to quit?” text boxes. It’s an odd thing to complain about in 2016 but it happened on several occasions.I had a lot of fun learning the ins and outs of each character and weapon and, like a good fighting game, I found the character I’m going to stick with. I played many hours of Nuclear Throne and I expect it to be the game I come back to the most in 2016. Nuclear Throne knows what it is and makes no bones about it. It’s a difficult, stylized roguelike with a clear vision of what it’s trying to achieve. Everything from the unique art style to the tough-as-nails gameplay makes it a rollercoaster of emotions whether you’re playing it for 15 minutes or 15 hours.Ultimately, Immortal Redneck has its share of issues but it’s a good addition to the rogue-like genre with decent FPS mechanics, an interesting setting, and a fun upgrade system that’ll keep fans coming back.But at the same time the unfortunate business model of Hero League and the sense of the grind in this meta-game of collecting and leveling up heroes takes the fun out of the parts that are enjoyable. Perhaps with time Heroes of the Storm can age into something great, for now it’s worth checking out if you want to experience a different take on a popular genre.Rogue Legacy bridges the gap between the old classics of the SNES days and newer indie titles of this generation. Its old-school graphical look and amazing soundtrack mesh with its clever gameplay concepts to create something truly unique. While boss battles can create a bit of a grind and the occasional glitch is fairly noticeable, I truly enjoyed my time with Rogue Legacy. Its fluid mix of combat, platforming, and smart humor made me enjoy each of my 100+ run throughs just as much as any other. After spending nearly 20 hours with the game I can honestly say I’d love to jump right back in, if only to conquer the castle just once more.Trying to mix genres to create something new is something we’ve seen done dozens of times. The last game I remember taking the MOBA formula into a successful new area was Monday Night Combat, now called Super Monday Night Combat. The third-person action genre being mixed with the typically-top-down MOBA game world was an interesting mix. Archeblade feels fresh and interesting at first but it soon degrades into a crazy melee of characters jumping around and attacking as clunky animations prevent the game from really capturing what is so unique about it. Overall it’s hard to recommend a game that feels so lacking, both in terms of quantity and quality.The Bug Butcher takes an old, proven formula and brings it into the modern era. Many games have taken the Galaga style and slapped a fresh coat of paint on it, but The Bug Butcher does more than that. The game takes the formula we all know so well and adds a great look, some fun power-ups, and interesting enemies that keep the game fresh for its short duration. While The Bug Butcher won’t be amazing gamers with its unique premise anytime soon, it’s a game that is well worth playing for a handful of hours.",

Anyone care to add any other PS4 / PSVita glitches?Glumauig21 (talk) 01:55, December 31, 2015 (UTC)I wish there was a option or mode or something were you get to choose your own weapons and what stage you want to be on and what mutations and crowns, because when you loop and have awesome weapons and cool mutations. It is soooo fun. Also you could make it so that you cant unlock characters or unlock golden weapons or crowns doing that so people cant just unlock everything doing this.RooshiRum (talk) 19:46, February 16, 2016 (UTC)So i need help with something, i've found a little secret within the games, where would I post it/ how can i post it into the wiki?On a side note, for some reason when I try to confirm my email, the confirmation email isn't sent to my email...RTieArt (talk) 09:17, March 9, 2016 (UTC)Could we make an official ranking about weapons, a ranking where everyone could vote, and that would stay, not a zone per zone rank, a global, showing all the weapons comparated to others, i know that it really depends on the character you have and the mutation, but this would really be appreciated, and i might not be the last one asking something like this.Janorio (talk) 21:48, March 9, 2016 (UTC)Just an random idea of having a bleed mutation that targets mainly higher hp enemies and bosses.The ingame text would be \"Enemies bleed\" or \"Bleed on hit\"The effect would be something like every time you hit the target it applies a stackable debuff on them that takes away a certain % of their current HP every ____ seconds. I guess the maxium stacks one enemy could have would be 5?or the effect can be even more complicated/nerfed by making it a 10% to apply a bleed effect that deals a certain % of their hp every _______ seconds maybe stackable?The name can be Hemorrhage <--- just an idea.im kinda liking the second effect better because it seems less good and in turn not op, but if anything is stackable then the overrall dmg should be lowered. This mutation could be really good with high fire rate weps to rapily apply bleed. The charactor on the card Y.V or roids, but i noticed only a few characters are being used for the cards so if only those chars then i think maybe fish? It would show the charactor with a bleeding cut and the top right picture for it would look imagine a <> but streched more out and round. Also tilted so it's diagonal and has a tear of blood dripping. If you google \"Bleeding cut cartoon\" you will see something like what i said.Anyways thanks for reading this for anyone that did, it's just a random thought and i dont really need to see it be made into a reality.Ramtasitic (talk) 06:35, March 15, 2016 (UTC)do u guys remember what the game before nuclear throne. i cant plz tell meI have a quick question about looping:Do the level layouts stay the same after each loop or are they different every time?Thank you for answering!WonderGamer101 (talk) 04:41, May 27, 2016 (UTC)If you are asking if the floor plans are repeats of how they were pre-loop then no I believe they are not. 73.116.9.225 05:36, December 19, 2016 (UTC)Are these a glitch or actually intended?   I get them soooooooooooo often and they ruin lots of runs for me.  Is there a method behind running into these or are they some kind of bug?  73.116.9.225 05:38, December 17, 2016 (UTC)I really think the wiki's airhorn sound when pressing B should be removed or at least disabled by default for all visitors. The gunshot and screenshake is fine, but idly browsing the wiki only to be deafened by an unexpected horn when you search for \"Rebel\" or \"Labs\" or \"Big green rat\" or \"Snowbot\" or etc is shitty.

Could you please explain it? I'm really interested in that idea for my own wiki.Michaelpie5 (talk) 19:27, April 2, 2017 (UTC)Hello, i have been playing this game for a while and i dont know what changes if i change side art, if somebody could tell me what changes? thank you ^^ 190.225.98.188 03:37, January 7, 2018 (UTC)Has anyone thought to add the April Fools day joke that was Nuclear Throne FPS to this wikia?

      "Nuclear Throne first killed me in less than two minutes, when I was unable to dodge the salvo of a scorpion-like creature and I was then touched inappropriately by a worm that reminded me a lot of Frank Herbert's Dune.The onslaught continued for about one hour, time during which I died at the hands of a lot of enemies, including lowly rats and maggots, but I also learned a lot about the world I was exploring and the best way to stay alive and kill my opponents.The game is a mash-up of influences and core mechanics that work despite the fact that they initially seem overwhelming and difficult to understand.Death is never conquered in Nuclear Throne, but the player will slowly learn, through repetition and luck, how to make more progress, gain more weapons, improve his characters and deal with normal enemies and powerful bosses.Vlambeer is offering the title only on the PC and the game has long been in Early Access, which means that there's a lot of content to experience, and all the core mechanics are very well polished.Nuclear Throne is a rogue-like, and there's little in the way of a classic narrative that the development team offers to the player, although a lot more can be gleaned from the levels, the enemies and even the weapons by those who want to create their stories.The world is a wasteland, with some of the mutations and creatures as clear indications that atomic weapons were deployed and devastated the entire world, creating anomalies that STALKER would not be ashamed of.The game also features plenty of similarities to Fallout when it comes to world building, but Vlambeer is much more interested in the mechanics of the experience than in delivering loads of text or details about the weapons or the enemies.There are plenty of characters to choose from in Nuclear Throne, most of them unlocked by progress, and all of them are unique, each class clearly designed to allow the player to put together his cool stories of reaching for victory before being inevitably defeated by this wasteland filled with threats.The small snippets of text that appear during level transitions are worth mentioning for their ability to induce hope or panic with just a few well-placed words, with my favorite currently being \"Death, death, death,\" which perfectly sums up the atmosphere of the game.Nuclear Throne is a very classic take on the rogue-like, a game that procedurally generates levels and enemies and challenges gamers to get as far as possible without dying, although in the end it's impossible to avoid this fate.Players are dropped into the middle of a world, asked to take out all enemies moving around to open up a gate (magic portal or advanced tech?) to get to the next one, doing so until they reach the special royal chair mentioned in the title.To make good progress, players will need to carefully manage their health and their combination of weapons and ammo, choosing when to fight, when to run and how to use the environment in order to get an advantage.Initially, the enemies are relatively slow to fire and move around in relatively predictable patterns, allowing players to plan how they will approach an area and then strafe when the level allows it to take them out.The biggest limitation is the fact that only two weapons can be carried at once, and ammunition can often be scarce, especially for the most powerful guns.The health of the player characters is low enough that even one enemy hit can feel like a huge blow, but in the first three levels it's not hard to stay alive, get some cool new weapons and prepare for the challenge ahead.Nuclear Throne then introduces snipers, cops, fast rats and many more, enemies better equipped to surprise with their accuracy, their speed or their unique abilities.Death comes very quickly when the player is overwhelmed, unable to find ammo or get a weapon that gives him a fighting chance or fails to register the fact that an enemy is very close and ready to deliver a killing blow.The bosses created by Vlambeer are also deadly the first few times the player meets them, and only solid on-the-fly learning and planning will make it simpler to deal with them.In order to give gamers a fighting chance, the development team offers some unique powers for each character, with my favorite being Crystal's deflector form that allows him to get out of hairy situations, and a unique new mutation for each level up, ranging from more max hitpoints to an ability to explode corpses.“There are plenty of combinations to explore in Nuclear Throne, which add replayability even beyond the traditional confines of the rogue-like space, and through hours of constant failure I always knew that there are alternate ways to approach each of the moments that led to my demise.”Constant failure can become annoying at times, which is why Nuclear Throne is best enjoyed in small doses, one to two hours, with breaks designed to allow the brain to process all it has learned about the game and how it can influence future strategy.I had the most success using Crystal when I managed to get an assault rifle and a laser-based weapon, which allow a player to choose between accuracy and overwhelming numbers of bullets when attacking an enemy position.The grab upgrade and power that increases the number of health and ammo drops are also very helpful.The beauty of Nuclear Throne is that gamers can choose how they want to approach the game and play knowing that when they die and see no way forward, they can switch to someone new or can try a different upgrade path.Nuclear Throne is a weird-looking video game, with the fast-paced rhythm of the action able to make the entire experience look better than it should while also exposing the fact that the player should not be focusing on the looks of the title at any point because that tends to get him killed.There's an incredible variety in the design of the levels and the enemies the screen shakes each time the player shoots or when he gets hit, creating a constant rush of adrenaline even early on, when there are relatively small number threats to worry about.Gamers can turn down the movement of the screen and increase auto-aim to get a tamer experience and to make easier progress, but the kinetic overload of Nuclear Throne is one of unique aspects of the experience, even if it takes a little time to get used to.The sound design of the game is superb, with some very creepy environmental sounds and songs that underline the violence and the constant danger associated with this futuristic and mutated wasteland.The developers at Vlambeer have taken some familiar ideas and added their unique twists, the biggest of which is the need to use the environment and the character powers to conserve ammo in the long-term.Using tons of bullets or powerful explosives to clear one level can feel empowering and makes the game feel a little easy, but soon after gamers will regret their recklessness when they are forced to use a melee weapon because they lack any actual ammo.Nuclear Throne is a cartoony, violent, great-sounding experience, and it can offer plenty of hours of fun both to those who love the rogue-like experience and to those who have only heard about its attractions and are looking for a point of entry.",

      "Hand of Fate is an action role-playing video game developed and published by Defiant Development for Linux, Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, released in February 2015. A PlayStation Vita version was announced but ultimately cancelled due to development issues.Hand of Fate has the player work their way through randomized dungeons, generated by cards selected from customizable decks, to try to reach a final boss of each dungeon. Most of the game is played through an in-game tabletop tableau, with the player's actions narrated and executed by the mysterious Dealer, at times requiring the player to make choices to proceed. When combat occurs, the game switches to a third-person perspective brawler-style game, requiring the player to time attacks, blocks, dodges, and other abilities to defeat enemies without losing all their health. As the player progresses, they can earn tokens, which, upon completion of a dungeon (successfully or not), gain them additional cards that they can used to customize their decks for the next dungeon run.\nHand of Fate received generally positive reviews, and led to the successful crowdfunded physical variation of the game. A sequel, Hand of Fate 2, was released in November 2017.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nHand of Fate is an action role-playing video game with roguelike and deck-building elements. The player takes the role of a nameless hero that meets a strange Dealer voiced by Anthony Skordi, in a \"cabin at the end of the world\". This dealer narrates the player's adventure, dealing the game's cards, rewards, penalties, lore, and commentary. He also serves as the primary antagonist for the game.\nOn starting a new game, the player is given a starting deck of cards, consisting of equipment, hero class, and encounter cards. The player earns more cards as they progress in the game, which they can use to customize their deck up to a fixed size. Furthermore, the dealer has his own deck from which surprising elements such as more challenging encounters and monsters are drawn that also grows as the player gains cards and progresses through the game.\nIn the game's Story Mode, the player must defeat thirteen bosses: twelve court cards and the Dealer himself. These bosses, representing the royalty of each suit, must be defeated in order, but the player can return to previous bosses to challenge again and unlock new rewards. After a certain number of these bosses are defeated, the player also unlocks Endless Mode, which provides an infinite number of \"floors\" of increasing difficulty for the player to challenge with every card they have collected up to that point.\nTo progress in Story Mode, the player must complete a \"dungeon\" by exploring two or more \"floors\" created by a tableau of randomized, face-down encounter cards dealt from the combined deck of both player and Dealer. In addition to random encounters, each floor also includes either an exit encounter that lets the player reach the next floor, or a boss encounter on the final floor of that dungeon. The player starts with a limited amount of health, food, and initial equipment, modified by the player's selected class card and certain conditions obtained over the course of the story. To navigate each floor of the dungeon, the player moves a token across the tableau one card at a time, revealing it if face down. When each card is encountered, the Dealer narrates the event and resolves its effects.\nEvents can include meeting non-player characters, shops to buy and sell cards that benefit the player for the remainder of that dungeon, enemy encounters, or chance events that may benefit or hinder the player. Some of these events include a tree of options that the player can choose, while chance is presented as four shuffled cards representing rates of success or failure. Each movement step consumes food, and certain events can cause the player to gain or lose health, food, gold, blessings, curses, or equipment. The latter three can augment the player's attack power, defensive power, health, speed, or provide special abilities or conditions both inside and out of combat.\nIf the player encounters a monster or maze of traps, the number and type of enemy are determined by cards drawn by the Dealer (if any). The game then enters a third-person perspective action mode, where the player can attack, dodge, reflect and counterattack enemies and traps represented by the cards that were drawn. Damage taken is reflected in the player's overall health, which can be recovered normally with food or at certain shops and healers. On completing some encounters, the Dealer will present special tokens representing new cards that the player will receive at the conclusion of that dungeon, regardless of whether they won or were defeated.\nIf the player's character loses all of their health (i.e., by encounter or starvation) or chooses to forfeit from the in-game menu, they lose that dungeon, and the board is reset after they receive their tokens. If the player successfully beats the dungeon's boss, they progress one step forward in the story. The Dealer awaits the player for the final showdown and confrontation, so the player must pay close attention to deck-building, strategy, tactics, and chance in order to succeed.\n\n\n== Development ==\nHand of Fate was first shown at the 2013 Game Developers Conference.  A playable demo build was shown to the public at PAX Australia in July 2013.  By this point, the game had been in development for under six months. Defiant Development are a team of approximately fifteen based in Brisbane, they described Hand of Fate as their \"first big push\" onto PC platforms following their previous mobile projects.  Like all other Defiant games, Hand of Fate is built in Unity.The game was part funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign.  It was one of the first Australian projects to launch on Kickstarter.  The campaign launched in November 2013 and concluded in December 2013, achieving its A$50,000 target.  Not only was the campaign a financial success, it also allowed Defiant to build an audience and get feedback on pre-release builds. A Greenlight campaign was launched simultaneously so that the game could be released on Steam, and the game was approved in January 2014.A week following the crowdfunding campaign, an alpha build was released for Kickstarter backers. A beta version followed in February 2014, and in July, the game launched for Windows, OS X, and Linux on Steam Early Access. The full version was released for Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 17 February 2015.A sequel, Hand of Fate 2, had been announced with a planned early 2017 release, but was eventually first released on November 7, 2017 for personal computers and PlayStation 4, with an Xbox One version to release shortly afterwards. The sequel will add more challenges that the player must meet to proceed in dungeons, stronger monsters to face in battle, and companions that can be gained during the adventure which assist the player in combat. Hand of Fate 2 will also release on the Nintendo Switch on July 17, 2018.\n\n\n=== Board game ===\nDefiant worked with the board game development company Rule & Make to transition the video game into a deck-building game called Hand of Fate: Ordeals. The board game allows for one to four players to cooperatively work together to process through quests in a similar manner as the video game. They sought about $22,000 in crowd-funding for publication via a Kickstarter campaign in May 2017; the campaign surpassed its goal within a day, and ended with more than $360,000 pledged.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn July 2016, Defiant Development partnered with IndieBox to produce an exclusive, custom-designed, physical release of Hand of Fate. This individually-numbered collector’s box included a themed USB drive with DRM-free copy of the game, official soundtrack, instruction manual, Steam key, and several custom-made collectibles.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHand of Fate received positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Microsoft Windows version 81.58% based on 13 reviews and 78/100 based on 27 reviews, the Xbox One version 79.75% based on 12 reviews and 80/100 based on 11 reviews and the PlayStation 4 version 79.28% based on 18 reviews and 79/100 based on 15 reviews.The game sold about 400,000 copies across personal computers and consoles, and it was downloaded more than 1.5 million times as part of a free game promotion for Xbox Live.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDefiant Development",
      "We are incredibly pleased to announce that Hand of Fate 2 will launch November 7, 2017, on PC, Xbox One and PS4. Oh gosh, that’s so close!Quick! Check out our new trailer over at Game Informer while I have a quiet panic attack.Along with announcing our release date (November 7, 2017 - coming to PC, PS4 and Xbox One!) we’re also revealing our final companion, the Indomitable Ariadne of Stiegal. A powerful melee warrior, Ariadne brings a keen blacksmith’s eye to the battlefield, shattering the armor of even the sturdiest opponents. On the tabletop, her boundless optimism allows her to duplicate chance cards, dramatically improving the player’s odds of success. Players will meet her properly in the Strength Challenge, though keen-eyed adventurers may encounter her earlier than that.HoF2 has blossomed into a project that we are deeply proud of, with noticeable improvements to every element of the original game. It’s massive, too. What was intended to be a game of equal length to HoF1 has transformed into something roughly four times the size, bursting with new characters, new enemies and a fantastic variety of new challenges.We think Hand of Fate 2 is the best game Defiant Development has ever produced, and we can’t wait to share it with you. Mark November 7 in your calendar as the day you return to the Dealer’s table and once again…Draw your cards, play and your hand and discover your fate!PS. I couldn't let this opportunity slip by without showing off another couple of fantastic concept pieces from our artist, Nick Smith!The boardgame adaptation of Hand of Fate, HoF: Ordeals, is now on the third day of its Kickstarter campaign and has already hit the $100k mark. If you're yet to check out the campaign, head over to Kickstarter right now! Do it in another tab, though, don't just... argh....they left.That's fine! Those of you didn't immediately blast off to pledge can take a look at this fantastic coverage we've gotten from the gaming press community.Firstly, here's Man Vs Meeple's in-depth preview of the game and its components. I'm not too proud to admit that watching this made me realize I was handling combat incorrectly.Here's Geek & Sundry showing off some rather swanky looking painted miniatures.CNET says the game feels like a natural fit for the table, and that the components are gorgeous. You're too kind, gang.Quarter to Three thinks it's weird to see so much color on the cards, but isn't going to let that stop them backing the Kickstarter.And finally, here's Kotaku announcing the fantastic news that we smashed our Kickstarter goals in the first twenty hours. It was actually six, but hey... who's counting?Everybody in the studio is industriously putting the finishing touches on the HoF2 Preview (formerly known as \"the Beta\", but there's so much excellent content in there we've outgrown the term), but I wanted to show you a cool new artifact that you'll soon be able to play around with.Say you're tasked with defending a gormless farmer from a horde of skeletons. Problem, right? Not if you're armed with some Holy Purification bombs.Skeletons! I hate them. I don't even like to admit that I have one.Ready. AIM...POW.Let's take a look at that again in slow motion.Another farmer successfully rescued from their own foolishness.The bomb artifacts (there are three kinds. Collect them all!) are introduced in the Lovers challenge, and they're provided to you by a mysterious goblin in a false beard. Whoever that could be...The Lovers is one of the eight challenges you'll be able to try in the preview event. If you still haven't signed up, there's still time! All you have to do is join our mailing list on the HoF2 page.PS. That was a clever headline and I regret nothing.It's time to harass another game developer in the middle of something much more important! This time it's designer Anna Zou, the former intern responsible for the creation of HoF's beloved mischievous goblin mentor, Mr Lionel.Lee: Who are you again, and what do you do at Defiant?Anna: I'm Anna and I do design-y things.What were you doing just before I interrupted you with this interview?I was working on the CENSORED Encounter Chain.Oh man, I'm going to have to bleep that name.yeah, whoops.I was working on a secret companion's encounter chain*...writing text and trying to resist making any more potato-related jokes.Potato related jokes do seem to take up a lot of your time at the moment, so I'm going to return to that later. But first, how did you get your start with Defiant?In the third year of my Games Design degree I somehow landed an internship at Defiant. Then I got contracted on part time as a Junior Designer. Then I went to Japan for a year to eat all of their sushi and pat all of their tiny dogs.\nDuring my time over there, I got offered a full time position as a Designer so I flew back and it's been jolly good times ever since.I can't say for certain why I was offered this position - probably because I threatened a lot of people, but I can't be sure.Should I speculate on why?Well, you already sound crazy. Now I need to know why you think you got the job.Apart from the threatening, I didn't do much of note during my time as Junior Designer. I did make the encounter Mister Lionel, and apparently people liked that, so presumably, that is a reason why.We had to lock down Mister Lionel. Didn't want you going off to a competitor and creating the hilarious hobgoblin Doctor Leonard for them, subsequently weakening our brand.Yeah I'm pretty locked down - that was the extent of my creativity so....But I can tell you why the community responded to Mr Lionel - you get him in your deck relatively early on so more players experience him, the card has multiple outcomes, there a very tangible benefit in getting a shield, and the encounter itself is just weird enough to be memorable long after the game is over.Weird enough to be memorable is my motto in life.I'm getting that on a shirt for your next birthday.Do you even know when my birthday is Lee? Hmm?That's why we have these interview questions, Anna!You just wanted to strengthen our friendship?Couldn't be stronger - we have an unbreakable bond already. Moving on, though. Do you remember how it was that you came to create the Mr Lionel encounter? Was there any kind of design brief, or did you just go \"A goblin in a fake beard is going to be weird\"I was tasked with looking over the analytics to see if there was anything I could fix. Before the Mister Lionel encounter there was a big spike at the end of the Queen of Dust challenge where players would die a lot, and it turns out the final fight was way easier with a shield.So rather than giving a shield to the player for this challenge, I thought it'd be more fun to make an encounter that gives you one, but also provides a place that player can gamble their things away, because gambling is fun, kids.So the encounter was a reaction to the data Defiant was pulling from the early access builds?Indeed.There's a hot scoop. That's one of the archetypal HoF cards and it only exists because players were terrible at the Queen of Dust! I hear that the recurring ghost encounter is also yours?The Queen of Dust is quite a trying fight without a shield I'd say, so really you could say we were the terrible ones for even making it like that.Yes, I've actually completely forgotten the name of the ghost cards. Probably because they weren't weird enough to be memorable.(Anna and Lee are talking about the Hand of Fate cards called \"Asleep in the Forest\" and \"Asleep at the Inn\". They're great.)That being said, I hope people cried genuine tears of sadness when they played those encounters. If not, then I'll be very disappointed in everyone, especially you.I bawled like a baby. Again, this is a sequence demonstrating one of the key conceits of Hand of Fate - despite being a card game that resets itself every session, your experience is persistent and the cards themselves evolve as you play. I think that took a lot of people by surprise - they were expecting a tropey dungeon generator but there's a narrative thread that carries through from start to finish.Yeah, that's something that I love about HoF too - that you unlock a new card and a world of potential awaits. As somebody who used to play those old text adventures on the computer machine, HoF definitely scratches that itch. Except it's better because it has pretty card art.Speaking of HoF too... you're now working on HoF2. What an elegant segue!You impress me more every day. Yes! HoF2! Should I say something else?The fun part about working on HoF2 is that I get to essentially play more of the game as other designers finish making encounters or challenges too. And then we critique them harshly, but that's also part of the fun!As a designer, what excites you most about HoF2 (beyond the obvious \"there will be more Hand of Fate!\")?I really like how HoF2 has more content for deck-building - not just in a \"win the challenge\" kind of way, but also in a \"I wonder what happens if I put this in my deck with this\" way. For example, what happens in an encounter can change depending on what Companion you took along or if you have a particular number of blessings etc.Creating encounters that make players want to experiment with their decks is exciting to me.Ooh, card synergies! Can you provide an example?Spoilers! Well I can say there's a blessing in the game that adds an extra Huge Success into the Chance Card mini-game, so even if the mini-game didn't have a Huge Success to begin with it would add one, and open up this new branch to the encounter that is previously undiscovered.I'm not sure if this is too much of a spoiler or not.WhaaaaaaaThat's amazing.And of course, companions may make their own little quips and comments on the encounters as you play.Thank you for bringing up our companion characters! Has their inclusion changed the way you approach encounter design for HoF2?Narratively, we're able to give more of a voice to the people in the HoF universe. Like what is Malaclypse's take on the scourge of corruption or maybe you can find out about what the deal is with the raiding Northerners from a Northerner himself, Colbjorn.So we took a new build to PAX East recently, and this build featured what might be your magnum opus - the Lovers challenge. Can I ask you about that? Can I ask about Oswin? What's the Deal with Oswin?You may not.(The Lovers challenge tasks the player with escorting a farmer named Oswin on a journey to meet his beloved. Oswin is notable for a number of reasons: he's incredibly handsome, he's obsessed with potatoes, and he can't stop getting kidnapped by skeletons.)I think it's pretty clear what his deal is - he likes potatoes and rightly so. Potatoes are the king of vegetables.You don't have to convince me.If I may be so bold.You may.Thank you.But yes, he seems to just be your run of the mill, friendly farming chap. One does wonder how he got into a relationship with such a woman though.You're creating a scenario where I have to go back and leave editor's notes in parentheses in this interview, Anna.Haha, yeah, should I be more clear (I don't want to spoil the Lovers surprise ending).It's fine, I can go back and provide a synopsis. This'll be crystal clear. What's the design intention of the Lovers? What are you trying to get the player to do/learn?Initially my design intention was to make sure that this challenge wasn't a typical story of two star-crossed lovers and that it had a distinct challenge goal - which is keeping a companion's health from dropping to 0. We also wanted bombs to be introduced, which tied in well with the keeping-Oswin-alive-in-combat thing.From there it all sort of evolved. I think a lot of challenges are designed like that, we have a broad topic with maybe some beats we have to hit, and then it changes and grows organically as we create and test and see what works.What do you think makes for a good HoF encounter?The writing has to be not crap of course, if it can surprise the players in some way, if players can use it for their nefarious deck-building purposes, if it is intriguing narratively...that is a general list off the top of my head.Personally I love encounters like the Devil's Carnival in the first Hand of Fate, something that draws you in and has many different branching possibilities on what happens. Some people, I'm sure, aren't a fan of encounters like that. Which is fine, because one of our goals as designers is to make sure that the encounters do different things and are unique from each other.And to close this out: what else do you like to play? What are you playing at the moment?Any sort of turn-based strategy game I'm into - XCOM or Divinity: Original Sin kind of games. That being said, I've been sucked into the addictive-ness that is Overwatch lately.Oh and board games! Inis is such a good board game.What do you like about Inis?For those who haven't played it, it's a game with a Celtic theme you have to place down as many of your dudes as you can on the map, or in particular regions. This is all affected by what Action cards you have in this round and what the other players have. It's just good fun to plan what you're going to do in your head and hope that everybody else doesn't counter you or do something you don't expect - which of course they usually do. You never know who's going to win.And finally: what is the goblin situation vis-a-vis Hand of Fate 2?Well, Mister Lionel has made an appearance in the game already if you played the last PAX build. Goblins are still around and stealing shiny things, despite the Empire's best efforts to stamp them out. Some have allied themselves with the Thieves Guild - as much as one can ally with goblins.That's what the people want to hear. Thanks, Anna!Thanks for having me!If you follow our social media accounts (and if you don't, what are you doing? Get over there, they're great!) you might have noticed some strange movements on Twitter. It seems the Dealer somehow managed to escape from whatever nightmare hellscape he's been residing in since the conclusion of Hand of Fate, only to find himself trapped in the wholly new hellscape that is Twitter.For a while, he seemed content to simply needle the designer of our upcoming Hand of Fate boardgame, or engage in a Dealer-Off with the talented voice actor, Anthony Skordi. That didn't provide the challenge he was looking for, however, and so last week he launched into a full pick-a-path adventure, polling the community to determine the protagonist's actions.The complete adventure follows, but be warned - the Dealer took to tweet-chains like a pro, so this is preeeeetty long.Are you still here? I told you he was wordy. All that trouble and he ends on a cliffhanger? Perhaps he'll get a chance to conclude his tale at a later date. Stay tuned for further adventures!We are as keen as you are to find out what’s going on with the impending tabletop adaptation of Hand of Fate, so we sent our communications manager, Lee, deep into enemy territory (or at least a hostile Slack channel) to get this interview with Rule & Make’s Michael “Barantas” McIntyre, designer of Hand of Fate: Ordeals!Lee: SO! Who are you, exactly, Michael?Michael: I'm 26, male, live in Brisbane with my lovely wife. I would describe myself physically as soft.Accurate. How did you end up designing the Hand of Fate boardgame?Well, the first time round or the second time? There is a fun story there. Well I think it's fun.Tell me the story!Well, sit back and let me spin you a tale like silk from chaff.A year or so back, maybe more... through the grapevine we had heard word that Defiant were wanting to make a board game from their super great game Hand Of Fate.At this point I had only played a little Hand Of Fate so I was intrigued. I was discussing the prospects of this with Brendan Evans, the designer behind Skyward. We were throwing around a few ideas but nothing really came of it aside from me playing a whole lot more Hand Of Fate. I got really into it.Fast forward a few months I'm working in a computer store and in walk some members of staff from Defiant. I end up serving them somewhat purposefully. (My co-worker regained consciousness later on) and I pitched them a concept right then and there, dropped them my details and waited for a response.I never heard back. Was I crushed, destroyed, heartbroken? Nope. This was a reasonable thing. I think I had come across as somewhat of a raving fan who wanted to show them how I had all the red string connecting pictures in my garage to explain who the Dealer really was.But no loss here. I always think, take every opportunity.But clearly, all that hard work and obsession eventually paid off.35% hard work 60% obsession 5% desperation.Moving further down the road, I'm working with Rule & Make. Doing conventions, spruiking merch and doing some design work when they mention Hand Of Fate. So I was like \"Oh yeah they were looking for a boardgame right? I was working on my own thing for that at one point.\" For a couple of weeks I didn't hear anything about it until I get a call one night. \"Hey, we would like you to work on the Hand Of Fate board game for us.\" I was so excited. But in a totally professional and reasonable way.From there everything has been a massive blur as we have been hammering out iteration after iteration of Hand Of Fate: Ordeals.Seriously, one day we will get to release photos of all the versions we have. It's crazy.So let's talk Hand of Fate: Ordeals. There's a guy in the videogame, and he's clearly sitting down to play a boardgame. Why couldn't we just print that?Short answer, the dealer really disagrees with being put away in a box every night. I have the scars to prove it.Long answer, so much of Hand Of Fate comes from your interactions with the Dealer and we wanted to bring you something newer and a bit different. Since we wanted the game to be multiplayer and we didn't want the game to run itself, we needed to reimagine the Hand Of Fate experience for you and your friends on the tabletop.Plus if you've already played Hand Of Fate you know the outcome, you know the story. So we're making something that builds on that and becomes its own beast.Okay, next question! Videogame-to-boardgame adaptations are becoming increasingly popular, but a good videogame design doesn't necessarily translate cleanly into a physical game. What are the pitfalls you've had you avoid with the adaptation?Combat and Literal Magic.We are really fortunate that Hand Of Fate is such an awesome genre mash of action combat and card game that we have so much that we can draw on to build this board game.That said, we can't have straight combat like HOF has. It just wouldn't translate right unless we strapped some sort of rockem sockem robots to the side of each game. So we have opted for something a little different. That's all under wraps at the moment, but our playtesters have given us some very positive feedback.Our other issue is that in HOF the dealer is literally magic. While we have tried our hardest to add the ability to make cards fly around the table into perfect piles, using incantations to defy the laws of physics by drawing energy from alternate dimensions was not within our budget. So we have had to capture the same deck building and board setup in a smooth and easy to do manner but sans the flying ball of cards.What have you done to capture the unique feel of HoF in the boardgame?The feel of Hand Of Fate I think is two fold.First is the genre mash that is deck construction + turn based dungeon crawler.Hand Of Fate has an amazing and rich world that is told through the encounters you discover and the cards you earn. We wanted to bring out that emergent storytelling within the board game as well.The meat and potatoes of Hand Of Fate is a punishing and gruelling trek against the odds in which the player is constantly tempted to push their luck in order to claim victory.In Hand Of Fate: Ordeals you are still driven to push against the odds and take risks, but you also need to be doing this faster and better than your opponents.Oh. And you will probably die.Nice.Obviously, I've been tremendous to work with, but what has it been like running playtest sessions with some of the designers from Defiant?It's been great. Stepping into the offices for the first time kinda made everything real for me. Everyone at Defiant has been really eager to play it and they give great feedback. Having Morgan play and watch the game had been pretty intimidating, but luckily he is a nice guy.It is really interesting to see people so involved in the property get cards and be surprised and excited as they realise what they are or how we have tweaked things for Ordeals.How has the game changed between playtests? Which battle plans failed to survive contact with the enemy?How long do you want this interview to be? laughs The game has changed so many times. It never started with a board, we went through so many iterations of how to get cards. I would be very keen to show all the steps we went through once people have had a chance to see it.Last one: what's your favourite thing about the HoF boardgame? What is it that you personally can't wait for the audience to experience?I really like the bit where you get to draw cards. Drawing cards is just my favourite thing.Hehe.But really. The style of the game is what I like most. It's the combination of rogue-like and deckbuilder that I enjoy the most. Being able to change up, each game, what I will focus on building while trying out new card combinations.Excellent. Is there anything else you think fans of Hand of Fate should know?I think that people should know that this game isn't just Hand Of Fate the board game. It really is its own thing. You can play this to get the same kind of experience as Hand Of Fate but also something new and interesting.Thanks so much, Michael. We'll have much more information on Hand of Fate: Ordeals soon!",

      "Being located on the other side of the world to most gaming news outlets means our press releases tend to get distributed while we're asleep. The upside of this is waking up to a pile of positive responses. It's like Christmas!Hello, yes, we are releasing on the PS4 alongside the PC and Xbox One in 2017. We'll have a new demo on display at PSX 2016 this weekend, and you should come say hi! We're also showcasing our latest companion, Captain Estrella Fiore.We'll have more to say about Estrella on the weekend, but the feedback so far has been fantastic. As an added treat, here's a couple of pieces of early concept art our character artist begrudgingly (very begrudgingly) gave up.Our full announcement follows:BRISBANE, QUEENSLAND – Nov. 29, 2016 – Hand of Fate 2, Defiant Development’s upcoming action RPG that blends roguelike dungeon crawling, tabletop roleplaying and, collectable card games and roguelike dungeon crawling, will launch on PlayStation 4 in Q1 2017 simultaneous alongside the previously announced Xbox One and PC releases. Defiant Development will showcase a brand new demo of the game at PSX 2016 in booth B1008, debuting the third companion, Estrella Fiore.Captain Estrella Fiore is encountered by the player in the midst of her third military campaign to the North. She is a terror at range, and while her interests align with the player's, she'll be a fearsome companion. Should the player find themselves on the wrong side of the Empire, however,  Estrella will have some hard choices to make. On the tabletop, her unwavering persistence will also grant a second attempt during the new Pendulum minigame, designed to test precision and timing.Our heroine will lean on Estrella and other companions for support as she clashes with all-new enemy factions, including the new Greed and Frost suits. The Greed faction employs deadly assassins and alchemists to hound the player with swift attacks and evasive manoeuvres, while Frost’s Northerner giants leverage brute force and deadly homemade weapons to deal massive amounts of damage.Hand of Fate 2 builds on the original game’s distinct RPG storytelling and combo-driven combat with the addition of companions, new fighting styles to accompany the addition of two-handed and dual-wielded weapons, new level objectives, a map-based meta board game, and powerful new cards which can instantly sway a game in the player’s favor.In Hand of Fate 2, the magical dealer returns to train a new heroine in the game of life and death so she can exact revenge on the protagonist of the first Hand of Fate, who now rules as a xenophobic tyrant.The game’s challenges will be built from collectable cards. Players will create a deck from these cards, which the dealer then adds his own trials to, before laying out a hand to create a board game. Our heroine will travel from one card to the next, revealing new challenges to overcome including fierce third-person combat, dangerous locations to explore, tense minigames, and Dungeons & Dragons-style decision making.\nThe original Hand of Fate garnered more than 2.2 million downloads.",

      "By\nEric Watson\n2017-11-07T21:38:24.31ZReviewHand of Fate 2 is a satisfying sequel and a meatier dungeon crawler, but still somewhat hampered by limited combat.My Fame score was too high. When I drew the Infamous card again, I was faced with a choice: fight my way out of an angry mob of peasants, or submit to a trial by fire. I opted for the latter and was presented with a rotating beam of light along a pendulum of moving blocks. When I failed to stop the marker on the right block, the Dealer cackled with glee. My heart sank as he drew Pain card after Pain card and my health dwindled into nothing. I should have murdered the damn peasants.Hand of Fate 2 is, like the original, a world literally made of cards. The campaign is presented as a world map divided into 22 challenges, or levels. These challenges provide specific objectives, and rules, and dying fails the entire challenge. Each challenge places a series of cards facedown on the table, like a digital board game. You move your token from card to card with each one revealing a new encounter that could mean potential gold, food, loot, or combat.The mysterious robed figure known as the Dealer returns from the first game, bearing scars he earned from it. He still introduces each challenge with acerbic wit, mocking every failure and adding a colorful level of commentary to each card I encountered. Oddly, the Dealer ends up a bit sidelined this time around, as the storytelling in the cards themselves has been greatly enhanced.The outcome of nearly every card is determined by either a mini-game of dice, cards, or dexterity, or a battle in a combat arena. Most cards offer interesting choices and different levels of risk and reward, from deciding whether to help or capture a thieving child to playing multiple games of chance with an ogre—or just fighting him instead.RPGs using dice rolls is not exactly a new concept, but it's new for Hand of Fate. The sequel smartly expands by adding multiple games of chance and dexterity to its unique card-based series of dungeon crawls. Additions like this make Hand of Fate 2 feel like a much improved sequel.Each challenge you unlock presents a different storyline with unique cards, rules, and objectives. I was impressed with how deeply some of them could alter the game.One challenge tasks me with gathering resources to defend a fort from a never-ending barbarian horde. It transformed into a turn-based strategy game as I avoided enemy patrols, discovered secret paths, and worked to efficiently gather wood and stone, all while still traveling between cards across the table.A particularly difficult challenge crippled me from the very beginning, leaving me with only 10% health and no way to heal naturally. I failed again and again, finally returning later once I had completed other challenges and acquired better healing and life gain cards to add to my personal deck. Unlocking new cards and strategically building my personal deck for each challenge remained satisfying throughout the campaign.Companion cards are one of Hand of Fate 2's best new features. There are four in total, unlocked over the course of the game. Each is unique, wielding useful powers in combat and on the strategic layer. Colbjorn the barbarian, for instance, can unleash an effective stunning charge in combat. On the card screen he can add an additional die to any dice rolls, which was often the difference between success and failure.Companions’ stories are told through a series of companion-specific cards, compelling tales of heartbreak, betrayal, and redemption. Companions are also woven into other cards’ stories and frequently chime in during BioWare-style cutscenes. These moments made the world feel much more vibrant and interactive despite how much of it is text.The last few challenges are a gauntlet of dungeon crawls as my team and I infiltrate a palace to embark on a little regicide. The finale presents its consequences based on how well you completed your companions’ storylines, kind of like Mass Effect 2. The final battle has a neat twist (and thankfully nothing like the awful QTE slog the first game’s end boss was), but still ultimately came down to a standard combat arena.Combat is unfortunately the least improved aspect of the sequel, despite still being a major focus of many challenges and cards. When you happen upon enemies the strategic card layer shifts into a colorful third-person action brawler. Weapons come in multiple styles which are now designed to tackle specific enemy types, such as light weapons against thieves. Each weapon has a built-in special attack that can be activated after a certain number of combo hits, with more powerful weapons capable of stunning multiple enemies or delivering massive blows. Attacks can either be blocked or evaded, and you’ll know which to use depending on if the attacking foe glows green or red.Enemy types are fairly limited and largely unimpressive, from standard barbarians, soldiers, and ghouls to a few interesting things like giant ogres and fire-spewing grenadiers. The arena background art and unit animations look great, but you’re still mostly just fighting humans in small spaces.By the halfway point in the campaign I saw almost everything the Dealer would throw at me. Later bosses scale up with more HP and armor, and regular enemies mostly rely on large numbers to offer any amount of challenge, which leads to awkward Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-style enemy fights in which I would be surrounded by a dozen units while they politely engaged me one at a time—an issue which plagued the first game as well.At its best the rhythm of combat can be exhilarating. Many of the final battles in each challenge left me with a sliver of health as I quickly dodged to deliver the final blow, knowing that falling here would cause me to fail the entire 30-45 minute challenge. But in reaching that point most fights grew repetitive, particularly if I hadn’t yet found a decent weapon. It takes too long to kill anything even with the upgraded starting weapons, and you never have many options beyond frantically clicking, dodging, and occasionally unleashing your weapon ability or artifact. I also constantly struggled with the annoying fixed camera and auto-targeting. It never felt like I had firm control over my character.Weak combat would be a killer for most RPGs, but Hand of Fate 2 more than makes up for it in the vastly improved strategic layer, and lovely storytelling. The deck-building strategy remains satisfying and the new variety of challenges adds a roguelike replayability to obtaining the gold rank for each one. If the first Hand of Fate was an interesting but flawed proof of concept, Hand of Fate 2 is a fully realized version of that deck-building dungeon-crawler.What is it?

      "A Unity ID allows you to buy and/or subscribe to Unity products and services, shop in the Asset Store and participate in the Unity community.LanguagePublished: January 5. 2015Read more about Hand of Fate and Defiant Development“We have an avid bunch of board gamers here at the office, and we especially like card games,” says Defiant developer Liam Hill. “Lots of them are played during our lunch breaks.” The studio’s upcoming Hand of Fate began with the idea that they could take the architecture and randomness of roguelike games, and afford the player more control over the challenges they would face, along with the rewards they would receive. “The card games that we play in the office are filled with ‘Random Event’ decks and ‘Treasure’ piles, and out of these two concepts sprung Hand of Fate,” says Hill.There are currently ten full-timers at Defiant, along with between one to three contractors at any given time. Most of the team members have worked together on previous projects, and have even worked at different studios together prior to Defiant.The team has used Unity since starting Defiant four years ago, having shipped a number of different projects on it for various platforms (including mobile hits Ski Safari and Heroes Call). “When we initially decided to use Unity for development, we were coming from our previous experience with custom engines that required a lot of work to get the best out of,” says Defiant’s Dan Treble. “Unity lets us punch above our weight, and allows us to ship Hand of Fate on multiple SKU's—including both next gen consoles—with relative ease, and with a much smaller team than we used to have in the AAA days.”The studio’s Morgan Jaffit tells us that the team is big believers in building and testing, and as such had a demo up very early on. In fact, he says, it was much easier to get a prototype up than it's been to finish the game. “We first showed the game to the public at GDC after a couple of months of prototype development, and even then it was clear we were on to something,” he says. Since then, he says various features have become invaluable, including blend shape support added in Unity 4.3, “without which we couldn't have brought the dealer to life.” He also notes that Marmoset Skyshop has added huge amount to the look of the game.According to Jaffit, much of the game is very similar to that original demo. “You can go back to some of our earliest videos—like our Kickstarter trailer from last year—and see the same concepts and core ideas in place,” he says.  Different elements of the game have evolved as time has passed, certainly, and deck-building has become significantly more important to the experience. “Ultimately, though, we had a clear vision at the start, and around that vision the game has grown into its own thing as we went. A lot of the details were missing, and we've gone through and filled those out along the way.”Treble says that generally speaking, the team goes to great lengths to keep everything as simple as humanly possible. “We keep all of our assets’ text, and try and split them up to avoid multiple people editing the same files,” he says. “Static batching is currently saving our frame rate.” They’ve also built a handful of tools within the editor, to help the designers create encounters, sequence animations in time to voice over, and to profile the scenes for memory and performance. “We’re producing builds monthly at the moment; we branch them a week before they’re due, and switch into bug fixing mode.”Jaffit remembers a moment at PAX Australia 2013, where Jerry Holkins from Penny Arcade played the game and pegged it as a “deck-building roguelike”. “This was a key moment, as we’d been struggling to get a succinct summation ourselves for weeks,” he says.Indeed, the years have taught the developers at Defiant a great deal about process. “We’ve learned to work in smaller, iterative cycles—approximately two weeks apiece—to keep track of progress,” says Kim Allom. “Short cycles work for small teams because it allows for more efficient resource use, due to frequent and regular checks on current project progress.” Allom says that when the team can spot an oversight or tweak a feature early in its development, it saves valuable time on backtracking. “It helps us [avoid] time spent on devising plans on how the tweak may effect other systems that the feature may link to, because it was further along in development.”With a haul of $54,000, Kickstarter certainly played a role in getting Hand of Fate off the ground—but it didn’t get them all the way. “The game has gone much longer than we anticipated, so we've definitely ended up spending more than the Kickstarter funds,” says Jaffit. “That said, the Kickstarter was really about finding our audience early.” He points out that Hand of Fate is a niche game, in that it appeals to fans of card games and deck-building who also enjoy an action component. “We wanted to make the best game possible for that niche, and Kickstarter helped us to find people who were enthusiastic and make them part of the development process. That's been worth much more than the funding.”“I'm incredibly proud that we've delivered something unique,” says Jaffit of the game that Hand of Fate has become. “There are no other games that do what Hand of Fate does, and we've given a sense of atmosphere and place that's incredibly strong. Everyone on the team has helped make that happen, and I think it comes across when you play.”Defiant recently announced that Hand of Fate will be coming to Xbox One, which means that the team has covered most of the available home platforms, including PC, Mac, Linux and PlayStation 4. “The team is currently going through technical requirements, and we’re excited by the idea of the public playing our game on console,” says Allom. The studio plans to release Hand of Fate in January 2015.Self-avowed “big fans” of the Unity Asset Store, the team at Defiant Development has been able to work smarter and faster because of it. Here’s a list of the many tools they’ve employed in creating Hand of Fate:\n•   Amplify Color \n•   BIG Environment Pack \n•   cInput Pro \n•   Hand Painted Texture Pack - Natural Surfaces \n•   Hand Painted Textures - Ground Pack 1 \n•   InControl \n•   Medieval Environment Pack \n•   NGUI: Next-Gen UI \n•   Pre-Integrated Skin Shader \n•   ProFlares \n•   Sage: Anim Graph Editor \n•   Skyshop: Image-Based Lighting Tools & Shaders \n•   Texture Pack 02 \n•   Top-Down Assets MobileHand of Fate visual style comes from the mind of Shawn Eustace, art director at Defiant Development. “He’s steered the games vision from the beginning,” says Morgan Jaffit, pointing to the difficulty of driving both a realistic high fantasy in-game style, alongside the illustrative, wood-cut style for the game’s cards. “Working back and forth between these two disparate parts of the experience and making them feel like they belong to the same world was extremely important, and Shawn's managed to harness the skills of our seven person art team incredibly well,” says Jaffit.PurchaseEducationDownloadUnity LabsResourcesAbout UnityGet Unity newsTo start receiving news from Unity Technologies, click on the link we've sent to your e-mail account.Something went wrong, please try again.LanguagePartnersWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

      "In Hand of Fate, you use a constantly growing deck of cards to form the very dungeons that you move through. You challenge increasingly difficult bosses, and seek to defeat the ominous dealer. Although Hand of Fate hinges on cards, it’s not a card game; it’s a roguelike action/RPG, and a surprisingly fun and original experience that comes together admirably.The dungeons are randomly assembled, so you never know what boons or burdens are under each card tile, but you can stack the deck with a few cards prior to each adventure. The rest of the deck is determined by the dealer, and you have to change your playstyle to accommodate. Some levels may curse you each time you opt to use a shop, so you may want to prepare your deck accordingly.You assemble equipment and encounter decks, which can be edited before each adventure. Weapons and armor you discover are drawn from the equipment deck. When you step over a card tile, the card comes from your encounter deck. These cards can be standard enemy encounters, which offer fast-paced action combat with blocking, swinging, special abilities, and a lot of dodging. The battles are fun, but take a backseat to the non-combat encounters that constantly leave you wondering if you made the right choice to gamble with drunks at a tavern or attempt to get a blacksmith to craft you the perfect weapon.Encounter cards aren’t always fights; they contain myriad other options that don’t take place on the battlefield at all. A player could wander through a secret portal to end up on another map entirely, meet a bard, explore a chasm, or strike a deal with a demon. These encounters often have tokens associated with them, and if the card is completed in a specific fashion, that token yields permanent cards to add to your core decks. A good portion of the game is management of these other encounters instead of a focus on fighting, as acquisition or lossof core resources can come from these events.Tokens are persistent, and you keep them even if you fail a map, which hedges any frustration that comes from dying during a level. You are constantly progressing, making things potentially easier on your next attempt. For instance, if you make a blood bargain with some vampires, it may cost you a nearly lethal amount of health and make you easy pickings in the next battle, but the token you acquire offers you some magical gear for the next attempt. This feels like an excellent compromise, making Hand of Fate sort of a “roguelite” as opposed to a strict, unforgiving roguelike.You manage three key resources along the way: gold, food, and health. If you run out of food, each tile movement costs you health instead of recovering it, so management of all three resources is crucial as you wander the dungeons. Combined with the other systems in play, these elements make Hand of Fate feel like an awesome tabletop experience with the dealer as a sort of dungeon master – you never know exactly what’s going to happen next, and it keeps things continually exciting.I noticed a difficulty spike toward the end, but overall the card-based journey is a fun, challenging jaunt that should leave you craving more as you run into disasters and tough battles, taking your tokens and licking your wounds as each attempt brings you just a little closer to the next boss. While the game could use some enemy variety, overall the good mix of encounters and potential outcomes shine and keep things interesting the whole way through.This review pertains to the PC version of Hand of Fate© 1991 to \n  document.write(new Date().getFullYear());\n Game Informer.

      "Video games long ago freed RPGs from the confines of the kitchen table, but some would argue something vital was lost along the way. The intimacy, unpredictability, and the friendly antagonism between Player and Dungeon Master. There’s a reason people still break out the graph paper and 20-sided dice even when there are much more technologically-advanced roleplaying options available.The Hand of Fate games attempt to combine that classic RPG appeal with more modern elements. Your adventures are literally laid out on a table by a shadowy card-dealing DM, but you also engage in real-time hack ‘n’ slash combat and other distinctly video-gamey things. Is Hand of Fate 2 a successful melding of old and new? Or should the game be thrown on the discard pile?Related Hand of Fate 2 Runs at 2160p on XB1X, 1620p on PS4 Pro; Dev Investigating Switch PortAs mentioned, Hand of Fate 2 pits you against the Dealer, who builds mildly-randomized quests, called “challenges,” using cards. They’re arranged on the table in different configurations and each turn you move one space, flip the card you landed on, and deal with whatever it throws at you. You may have to engage in a little “Choose Your Own Adventure” decision making, take part in a game of chance, or clash with a pack of baddies. As you make your way through the cards, you’ll also need to keep a close eye on your health, money, food cache, and level of fame.Each challenge is partly made up of its own unique cards, but before embarking you also choose your battle companion and a selection of encounter and equipment cards from your own deck. In theory, this gives you some control over how challenges play out, but, particularly at first, the effect is rather limited. The cards exclusive to each challenge are always the most important, and your deck simply isn’t varied enough alter things in an interesting way.Related Hand of Fate 2 Interview – Supporting PS4 Pro & Scorpio, Not Ruling Out SwitchTypically, I’d just choose the most obviously beneficial/powerful cards repeatedly. Why include, say, the Raiders Ambush card that may help or harm me, when I could just stick with the Arm Wrestling card that’s easy to win at and pays a ton of gold every time? It just didn’t feel like there was a lot of strategy to card selection. At least, not at first. Every time you complete a challenge, you’re awarded new cards and eventually your deck swells to the size where choosing cards becomes a bit more interesting. Even then, there still a lot of powerful, purely-beneficial cards you’d be a fool to leave out.Challenges are initially fairly straightforward but quickly become more creative. You may have to search for relics in a vast wilderness, deduce the identity of a would-be assassin, or gather resources to defend a fort from a barbarian horde. Some challenges aren’t so much creative, as they are sadistic – the less said about the one that starts you off with only 10 health points, the better. Hand of Fate 2 manages to convey an impressive array of different narratives with just a few cards strewn across a virtual table.While I admired the ingenuity of Hand of Fate 2’s diverse challenges, I didn’t always enjoy playing through them that much. Most the game’s events include an element of chance — a random card selection, roll of the dice, or blind decision. The consequences for failure are often nasty. Sometimes there’s no way to avoid punishment. Don’t like that your dumbass character just ate poison berries and permanently lost 25 percent of his health? Too bad! Once you learn the correct choices and strategy for each encounter you’ll be able to squeak by, but it may take a while to get there.Hand of Fate 2’s frustration factor is only compounded by its combat. Several times per challenge you’ll be whisked away to various 3D arenas, where you’ll test your mettle against packs of enemies. The battle system is simple enough – you can attack, dodge, block, counterattack, shield bash, activate you or your companion’s special move, and take out stunned enemies with a gory finisher. Imagine if Batman: Arkham Asylum looked kind of janky and didn’t handle particularly well, and you’ll have a good sense of what you’re in for. Arkham-style combat requires split-second timing, and Hand of Fate 2’s laggy, unresponsive controls aren’t up to the task. Whether or not your block or counterattack registers is pretty much a crap shoot, and enemies love to swarm you and attack from behind.The combination of randomness and uninspired combat means you’ll be dying a lot in Hand of Fate 2, and when you do, you’ll have to restart your current challenge from scratch. Played almost all the way through and died fighting the boss? Sorry, that’s 40 minutes of your life wasted. Worse, with the occasional exception, most cards are only gained by fully finishing a challenge. There aren’t a lot of options for grinding or improving through defeat. You can try to take on a different challenge, but if all the available options are just as difficult (as they often are), you may find yourself banging your head against the wall, hoping for a lucky run so you can finally expand your deck. The feeling of growth you get from a good RPG is lacking – as I built my deck I didn’t necessarily feel any more powerful.Hand of Fate 2 delivers around a couple dozen challenges, which took me about 20 hours to play through. Unfortunately, the game started to feel like a slog well before I reached the end. The game’s uninspired story didn’t help matters. Some individual character moments or bits of saucy dialogue are enjoyable, but the overall plot, focused on a loosely-sketched conflict between a powerful Empire, northern raiders, and dark magic wielders, is by-the-book fantasy stuff. The meta-story isn’t any more compelling – the game is rather vague about why you’re participating in the Dealer’s twisted game until near the end. It’s difficult to care about a game if you don’t know what you stand to win.This review was based on a PC copy of Hand of Fate 2 provided by publisher Defiant Development.Hand of Fate 2 captures some old-school RPG charm, but deals a few too many bad cards in the process. The game’s appealing premise is marred by unsatisfying progression, punishing randomness, and clunky combat. Nostalgic RPG fans will find things to appreciate here, but given the popularity and diversity of actual tabletop gaming these days, it’s hard to fully recommend the half-stacked Hand of Fate 2.Enter your email address to subscribe to our daily newsletter",

    "title": "Captain Forever Remix",
    "text": [
      "Captain Forever is a series of space shooter games by Australian developer Jarred \"Farbs\" Woods. Its name stems from both its development process, with new versions of the game being continuously developed and released and its endless gameplay. There are four games in the series, the first of which is free and paying supporters may gain access to any future sequels released without being required to make any extra payments. In May 2018, the first three games in the series, namely Captain Forever, Captain Successor, and Captain Impostor, were re-built and bundled as Captain Forever Trilogy on Steam. All current Supporters are to be granted Steam Keys to redeem the Trilogy, and as of May 2018 the Supporter program stopped accepting new members.A standalone \"remix\", Captain Forever Remix, was created by Pixelsaurus Games who worked in conjunction with Woods to bring the title to modern systems. Remix was released to Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux in March 2015.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nCaptain Forever was inspired by the 2007 freeware game Battleships Forever, which itself drew inspiration from the 2003 game Warning Forever.\nIn each game in the Captain Forever series, with the exception of Captain Impostor, the player pilots a ship with the ability to be expanded by attaching 'modules' (such as lasers or boosters) gained from defeated enemies to a command module, represented by a box containing a broken heart. The goal in the game is to keep your ship alive for as long as possible. As the game progresses, stronger enemy ships (labeled according to letters from the NATO phonetic alphabet) arrive. Destroying stronger ships increases the Law (levels within the game), until Protectors (Peacekeepers in the original game) arrive to attack. The game effectively ends after the first Protector is destroyed (replacing the command module's broken heart with a complete one) but the player may continue accumulating parts indefinitely. If the player's ship is destroyed, it explodes, destroying all ships in the immediate area and clearing the area for the player to begin rebuilding their ship from scratch. The default background is a grid of green lines over a black background with a faint image of a pilot's face in the middle. The background can be changed, however, to an image taken by the player's webcam.\n\n\n== Sequels ==\nCaptain Successor: Launched for supporters in November 2009, as the original game was made freely available to all players.  This new game introduces a variety of new weapons, propulsion and defensive modules, as well as more types of enemy ships.Captain Impostor: Released in March 2010, but is only available to paying supporters. It introduced the Clone Drive which copies enemy designs entirely and cannot be constructed module by module.Captain Jameson: A project that was intended to become a full-fledged RPG, it got scrapped in early 2013, but is still playable by Captain Forever supporters. The modern version of this is The Dawn Star.\nThe Dawn Star: Originally labeled \"Captain Jameson Reboot\", is a revision of the previous iteration. A commonly agreed origin of the name comes from a member page on the game's forums. The purpose is to further expand the game and to improve game mechanics and aesthetics.\nCaptain Forever Trilogy: The bundle was released in May 2018 and consists of Forever, Successor, and Impostor. All three games were rebuilt and available on Steam. Additional module types were added to the game, such as angled shield modules and graphics were updated.\n\n\n== Reception and awards ==\nCaptain Forever won the Best Game award at China's first Independent Games Festival in 2009.Captain Forever was also named as one of the 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.\n\n\n== Captain Forever Remix ==\n\n\n=== Gameplay ===\n\nAt its core, the Remix version is similar to the main Captain Forever games. The player controls a spacecraft which they can build from various modules, fighting against other spacecraft and using modules knocked off from those to expand their own. The Remix version adds a more direct goal - completing 10 stages as the player races to the end of the solar system, facing strong enemies in each turn. The game is structured as a roguelike, as the encounters at each stage are procedurally-generated, and should the player's core unit be destroyed, they must start the game from the start. Each stage is completed by meeting a specific goal, such as destroying a ship of a given level (as assigned by the game). A larger meta-game, based on progress during a given playthrough, unlocks new \"starter kits\" for the initial ship, such as ships geared for long-range attacks, or for close-range overpowered attacks. The starter kits can be upgraded as well in the meta-game, providing better modules within the kit at the start.The game is framed around Natalie Norberry, a schoolgirl that imagines herself as a cartoon character, Captain Forever, fighting to race to the edge of the solar system against enemies set at her by her younger brother.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nCaptain Forever Remix was a project born out by Pixelsaurus Games, made up of Dean Tate and Brian Chan, who had met while working at Harmonix before moving on to other studios. Both had tired of the larger studio environments and opted to work together on an independently-developed title. While brainstorming ideas, they recalled fond memories of playing Captain Forever and started to work a pitch to approach Woods with.They initially pitched the idea of Captain Forever HD, providing updated graphics and support for modern systems. Woods countered the idea, suggesting that they completely remix the game to keep the core gameplay but give it something new so that Tate and Chan's talents could be shown off. Encouraged, the two developed the Remix version under the idea of Saturday-morning cartoons to provide the childlike setting for the game. This direction allowed them to set the visual style for the game - where the backgrounds are inspired by a messy child's room - and to envision new module types they could include in the game. Woods was not directly involved in development but was kept apprised of the state of the game, and has seen ideas presented by Tate and Chan that he anticipates including into his own titles. Remix was developed in the Unity engine, which Woods noted took Tate and Chan time to recreate the core game play from the original Flash-based engine.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWhat is Captain Forever?, an article explaining and praising the Captain Forever series",

      "By\nChris Schilling\n2016-06-22T00:29:04.173ZReviewA warmly affectionate remake of a browser classic, with enough new pieces to justify its existence.You’re never more vulnerable in Captain Forever Remix than when you’ve just destroyed an enemy craft. You might think it’s the moment when you’re facing an opponent three times your size with six times as many guns. Not so. Carefully approaching one such vessel from its left flank, I managed to chip away at its defences, dancing nimbly around its laser blasts until it was a much fairer fight. At least until it caught on to my plan and took out my outermost bulkheads, leaving me with just a single booster. I pinwheeled around madly, firing desperately in the hope that a bolt or two might just hit its now exposed core. Incredibly, they did. Boom.As the fragments scattered, I began to scoop them up and attach them to my tiny command module. But our battle had created enough noise to attract a gigantic blue monstrosity, which silently entered the fray from above as I was distracted by rebuilding. Two or three direct hits were enough to permanently curtail my careless scavenging. I could almost hear Liam Neeson over my shoulder, stroking his beard and musing quietly “there’s always a bigger ship”.Like the celebrated browser game upon which this is based, Captain Forever Remix casts you as both space pilot and space pirate: you target a ship, fire a broadside into its hull until it explodes and claim its booty. But your treasure here is another man’s trash: you loot parts not coins, turning engineer as you bolt the most useful bits to your own craft and let the rest of the detritus float off into the unforgiving void. That’s the idea, anyway; quite often you’ll end up destroying the guns or shields you wanted most to get to the command module, your enemy’s last line of defence. Lose your own module, of course, and it’s game over.At the heart of Captain Forever is a fascinating tension. You need to keep your soft core protected, but you don’t want to make your ship too unwieldy. Quick and manoeuvrable seems like a sensible choice, but if you’ve got more boosters than guns you risk leaving yourself underpowered in a firefight. And while heat-seeking missiles might seem like a smart addition, are they going to give you the precision you need to target an opponent’s weak point without demolishing its most valuable assets? It’s a game where you have to make on-the-fly choices almost every minute you’re out there. Can I afford the extra bulk of these healing modules, or should I nab an extra booster? And you thought Telltale had the monopoly on tough decisionsAll of this was true of the original, but Pixelsaurus Games has built upon that elegant design in a host of smart ways. The most obvious difference is the addition of a story mode of sorts: you progress through the galaxy across ten levels, moving onto the next planet once you’ve beaten a higher-level rival, with a minute to sift through the remains and take what you need before the warp. Beat the fifth level and you’ll unlock another selection of parts to use from the off, this time with a focus on sniping. As you’d imagine, this makes for a nervy change of pace, as you zoom the camera as far out as it will go, and edge your way towards another ship’s signature, knowing they’re every bit as well-equipped as you to take a ship down from distance. Unlock the melee set, meanwhile, and you’ll engage in messy, close-quarters skirmishes. Brandishing buzzsaws to tactically dismember opponents? Why, it’s like a top-down Dead Space.While the presentation lacks the sparse beauty of the original’s irresistible combo of crisp neon geometry and stark blackness, it compensates in exuberant character. It’s possibly the first Nickelodeon-inspired roguelike, populated by a cast of misfits and oddballs that make Ren and Stimpy look comparatively normal. Expect a light dusting of narrative rather than a deep, twisted lore: all you need to know is that the action is prompted by a girl imagining her brother has become an omnipotent pink mutant, and she assumes her alter ego Captain Forever to take him down.Alas, in my hands, she was more Captain Ten Minutes. This is a savagely tough game on the default difficulty, seemingly a response to complaints during Early Access that it was too easy. Opponents are deft and aggressive, and occasionally comically overstuffed with ordnance. Perhaps I’m just a terrible engineer, or just not quick or clever enough to be able to improvise in a pinch, but once you’ve lost a piece or two, recoveries are difficult against foes this relentless, and retreats aren’t easy when thrusting forwards launches you into an ungainly spin. After a while I retreated to the relative safety of the sandbox mode, where your last 5,000 ship designs are stored, so if you have a build you’re particularly fond of, you can recall it and start again with a little more firepower. Here you can call upon Steam Workshop designs shared by other players; the thrill of commanding something grotesquely overpowered proved a blissful release after my struggles in the campaign.If it’s best played in short bursts, Captain Forever Remix is the kind of game I can see myself returning to regularly, tinkering with elaborate designs before watching them get blasted into space dust. After all, while Galak-Z remains my galactic go-to for thrilling dogfights, it doesn’t let me build a ship out of space Lego.What is it?

      "(User scores are recalculated daily)Captain Forever Remix recreates the original Captain Forever title with enhanced gameplay. Your objective is to design the most powerful spaceship you can from randomly generated parts from the ships that you destroy in the rougelike framework.Each individual game in Captain Forever Remix starts off the same with players building a starting spaceship from a handful of parts. These parts include the likes of missile cannons, engines, bulkheads and other modules that provide unique benefits. As players play more and more games the beginning pieces available will change which provides the underlying progression given the rougelike nature of the game where ship destruction ends your particular run.With your starting ship designed using the simple drag and drop interface players step into the procedurally generated level where you’ll encounter other ships. Your goal in each level is to destroy a particular level ship and is best achieved by exploring the surrounding area first to take out smaller ships and with luck find chests. Once your goal is achieved you’ll transport to the next level which features higher grade ships and potentially traps such as space mines which complicate matters further.By destroying these weaker opponents command module or locating chests you’ll get new modules to attach to your ship which you can opt to take or leave behind. In doing so players will slowly improve their strength either through greater movement capabilities, more damage or unique skills such as life steal. Players are not limited to changing their ship design after enemies are defeated either and can be done at any time, even in combat which creates some interesting on the fly decisions.For example players might find themselves surrounded by enemies in a ship with poor manoeuvrability and move their weapons to all sides of their ship to counter all opponents at once. While Captain Forever Remix does not feature a mini map players receive pings (similar to ripples) that indicate the locations of ships.It’s fast, fun, simple and always different which makes Captain Forever Remix a potent roguelike space title.Summary:Quick Links:Videos:Games Finder aims to provide the ultimate games like resource that allows gamers to easily find similar games based on their gaming history.About | Privacy Policy | Contact Us | Stores Like Finder |All names, brands and imagery used are trademarks and/or copyrighted materials of their respective owners.

      "Intro:Captain Forever Remix is brought to us by Pixelsaurus Games and Future Crayon, it’s an action game that closely resembles Asteroids in gameplay. In this game you travel across our solar system in the imagination of two kids, blasting enemies apart and collecting their parts to create a better ship for yourself.Gameplay:The controls of Captain Forever Remix again reminded me of Asteroids, using the arrow key to move the ship, but with the mouse coming into play to drag parts that you’ve just blasted off your enemies to add to your own ship, with an option to customise the controls on an option menu that pops up on start up this game’s controls were really easy to master. Playing the game was really fun, being tricky enough to challenge but not so impossible that the game gets boring and the randomly generated enemies made sure that my ship was unique in every play-through. The funny and wacky feel of the game really fit in well with it’s story, being the imagination of two kids playing a game where one has taken over the solar system and the other is trying to save it.Media:Captain Forever Remix’s cartoon-like artwork really fit into the feel of the game, the graphics were clear with bright colours and worked well on my computer because the game give you the option to choose the right settings for the computer on the options screen that pops up when the game starts. The audio, though a little bit annoying, fit the style of the game well and the game sounds were clear and also tied into the style of the game well, the volume level of both are changeable so if, like me, you find it a little irritating it is easy to adjust them, even during in-game.Final Verdict:Captain Forever Remix was a really fun game to play, it is simple to play but is still challenging enough to remain interesting. The funny and wacky feel that it gives is very entertaining and everything in the game fits well with that feel. The only issue I had with it was that the music was a little irritating but that was easily fixed. I especially like the ship customisation being an important part of the game, it’s an old concept made better in Captain Forever Remix.Summaryfunny and wacky feel that it gives is very entertainingThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

      "Runestone Keeper is a roguelike video game developed and published by Blackfire Games, with the iOS version developed by Cimu. It was released on March 23, 2015 for Windows and Mac OS X, October 31, 2015 for iOS, and August 11, 2017 for Android.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game is a roguelike that has been compared to Dungelot for the fact that the player explores levels by tapping on dark tiles to reveal them, but also adds \"extensive RPG elements\". The player can choose from six different classes and explores the level for keys as well as items. Each level has 56 tiles and the player can only move to the next level down by finding the stairs.To attack enemies, the player taps on the tile they are on, but each monster also has unique skills, like deflecting or absorbing damage. Enemies will usually counterattack only when attacked, unless they are ranged, while other enemies gradually get stronger if they are left alone. Wiping out all monsters on the floor gives the player an additional bonus.The player's own stats can be buffed by equipment, and items can give the player temporary advantages. Using items costs \"Soul\" points, making them only able to be used at specific times. The player can also sacrifice various things at altars to pledge themselves to a god and obtain a stat boost.When the player dies, they will bring back all of their money to their home base, allowing them to upgrade the base, buy characters or increase the power of abilities.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game takes place in a town above a mysterious dungeon known as the Runestone Dungeon that is said to contain great power. Many different warriors come to descend into the depths of the dungeon, but they are all trapped forever within it. Each time the player defeats the final boss, the game's universe \"resets\", unbeknownst to the player character, although other NPCs are aware of this. Each run of the game ends with the final stanza of The Hollow Men.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAlexandru Chirila of Softpedia scored the game's demo 4/5 stars, calling it \"a wonderful little dungeon crawler\" and \"a well-polished game even though it's still in the works\". Carter Dodson of TouchArcade called the game \"a solid game to check out\" and said that he \"had fun with it\". 4Gamer.net also recommended the game to players who were interested in roguelikes.\n\n\n== References ==",
      "Runestone Keeper is a rogue-like game. Each time a new game is started, the dungeon levels are generated; monsters, devices, exits, etc are placed randomly. The player has to start over if the character dies. The game will allow you to \"Save and Quit,\" but death is permanent (no loading from an old save point).Unlike other games, the character's avatar does not show up on the dungeon. Gameplay is slightly similar to Minesweeper, in that only the cell the player clicks interacts with the character (with few exceptions). If the player clicks the monster, it attacks back. If the player uncover a trap, they take damage from that trap, and so on. Most monsters and devices do nothing if they are not interacted with.As a rogue-like, the placement of items, traps, monsters and shops is random. Therefore, there is no build and strategy that is guaranteed to work everytime, and player are encouraged to adapt their strategy to progress further.The game shows the dungeon floor on the left, and the character statistics on the right.Kill monsters awards the character with experience points (XP). After a specific amount of xp is collected, the character reaches a new level. The character's life point and mana point is refilled, and the player can choose to upgrade one of the 4 base attributes by 1 point. The level cap in basic mode is 10.The basic attributes are:OffensiveDefensiveOthersArmor works like extra Life Points. Physical attacks (both melee and ranged) depletes Armor before reducing Life points. Traps that inflict physical damage (like Spike Traps) also deplete armor first.At the beginning of a dungeon level, the character's armor is refilled. The amount of armor depend on the character's equipment. Every hero starts with a Padded armor which gives 10 armor points. To increase armor points, the player can wear items that give bonus to armor. Worshipping the God of Rock gives you 10 extra armor points. If the player find an Anvil, it can be used to completely refill the armor points for free. Armor can also be temporarily increased by using skills.Strategy: Armor points are set based on equipment worn when you first enter the dungeon level. It is recommended that the player put on the equipment that provide the most bonus to armor before descending into the next level, to maximize the amount of armor points gained. After that, the player can swap them out for equipment that provides other bonuses.Resistance reduce elemental damage by a flat percentage. For example, if the character has 10% Resistance get hit by a monster with 10 Elemental damage, they will take 9 damage.To attack a monster, the player clicks on the monster portrait. The basic battle round works like this:For monster with melee attacks, they will only attack when the player clicks on them. Monsters with ranged attack, on the other hand, will attack every turn.The battle rounds will be changed based on various factorThe purple bar measures your soul points. Using items and devices on the dungeon consumes soul points. You collect 1 soul point on clicking on a mist-tile. There are several items that allows you to reveal more than one mist-tile per click, but you still get only one soul point per click on mist-tiles.Goddess of Benevolence and the God of Treasure benefits greatly the player upon collecting soul points.Soul bar capacity is 60 soul points by default. Every dungeon level has 56 tiles, meaning up to 55 soul points can be collected per level.Maximum number of souls can be increased from 60 by activating a tomb tile (50% chance of increasing by 2, and 50% chance instead of decreasing maximum hit points by 2).",

There are a few problems with translation but nothing new if you're familiar with chinese to english translations. \n\nAs far as the weird access permission popping up at game launch it's the same one a lot of games require except you accept by installing the game by default. This leads me to believe that the developers aren't that familiar with xbox in general and I'd guess any patches are unlikely.One person found this helpful.4/29/2018SeltharinRating:1/5As has been stated, the game requires permissions. I have never been a believer in allowing software developers to have that kind of access to my information. I decided to overlook this seeing as how the cash was already spent, and installed it. After hours of grinding, the game bugged out, causing the loss of all saved info. From this point forward, every restart of the software was clean as if no gameplay had occurred. \n\nFinal verdict: Invasive and unplayable.

      "Skyshine's Bedlam is a turn-based tactical roguelike and simulation game developed by Skyshine Games and published by Versus Evil. It was released on September 16, 2015 for Windows and Mac OS X.\nIt received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art and music, but criticized its story and high level of difficulty.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe player is the overseer of a massive wheeled fortress known as the Dozer, and must cross a post-apocalyptic wasteland safely. The player can choose a route on a minimap, which determines what types of encounters they have. The player can also upgrade the Dozer in order to make traversal of the wasteland easier.Fights take place on an isometric grid. Squad members come in four classes, each with their own specialties. Soldiers cannot be replaced when they die, and it is almost inevitable that casualties will occur.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe player must navigate the Dozer from Bysantine, a futuristic metropolis, to Aztec City, a distant utopia. Many factions control parts of the wasteland in between, such as Cyborgs, Mutants, Marauders, or A.I. Each trip is procedurally generated, and events occur differently in each playthrough.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe setting of the game was formerly a tabletop RPG, and was based on 80's science fiction and Dungeons & Dragons. The developers were also inspired by the fast pace of games like FTL and XCOM.The game uses the engine of The Banner Saga. It was originally known as simply Bedlam, but changed its name to avoid conflict with the game Bedlam released shortly beforehand, despite having already filed a trademark for the name. It was developed after a successful Kickstarter campaign which raised $166,540.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game received mixed reviews, with an aggregate score of 67/100 on Metacritic.Ian Birnbaum of PC Gamer rated the game 72/100, calling it \"punishing\" and \"stressful\", and saying that the difficulty was too high for him to enjoy. He stated that the inability to recruit new squad members if your existing ones died was where the game \"crossed the line from enjoyably brutal to stressful frustration\". However, he praised the soundtrack, saying that it was his \"favorite [...] in any game since Bastion\", and called the art \"wonderful\".Mat Paget of Gamespot rated the game 60/100, saying that while he believed it would be the \"perfect game\" for him at first glance, it did not have \"much strategic depth\" or a reason to \"care about [the characters]\". He called the story \"devoid of interesting or layered tales\".Artur Cnotalski of Eurogamer Poland rated the game 40/100, saying that it was \"monotonous\", with the storyline \"devoid of any depth\".\n\n\n== References ==",

      "Bedlam is a lawless wasteland, ostensibly ruled over by King Viscera and his Marauders, but in truth they’re just one faction among many trying to kill each other and everyone else. There’s also the Rogue AI, the Cyborgs, and the Mutants. They’re all out for blood, or fuel, or human remains that could be used for both. There are rumors of a paradise city far down south, Aztec City, but it’d be madness to try and cross Bedlam. So of course that’s exactly what you’re going to do.Skyshine’s Bedlam is a turn-based roguelike that combines the structure of FTL with the aesthetic of Mad Max.You’ll be crossing the desert of Bedlam in a dozer, a huge armored colony on wheels. You begin with a few resources, some soldiers, and 1000 civilians; how far you get is based on strategy, skill, and a little luck.You move through Bedlam like a board game. The dozer is a big red game piece that slides from node to node over a map of the desert. Each move adds a number of days to your journey, and each day uses up fuel and meat. You’re in constant need of resources, and each node presents you with a random event that can result in treasure, battle, death, or nothing of special note. There’s a good variety of events, and even a few that can branch in story depending on what ancient artifacts you’ve found, but the real highlight of the game is the combat.Skyshine’s Bedlam is the fastest turn-based combat I’ve ever seen in a game. Normally in this type of game turns are based on teams (my team moves then your team moves), but Bedlam speeds up the whole process by only allowing you two actions per turn: Move two characters, shoot twice, or move and then shoot, those two actions are all you get.This means things are always happening, there are no stretches of inactivity where you hunker down and wait for the enemy to come to you. The thing to learn about Bedlam is to give up any hope of perfection. The speed means that you can’t play defensively: Retreating with one character leaves all the others exposed. Soldiers will get hurt and have to sit out the next few battles as they recover, but wounds are better than death. The game is less about setting up long-term strategies and more about how well you react when your back is against the wall. It’s a fascinating departure from the usual turn-based combat design.This become more apparent the more you play, and the more you learn how to use each of the four soldier types. The Frontliners are your bait; men and women with a shield and energy sword, they don’t do much damage but they can take a ton of it. Deadeyes are snipers, prone to dying in one hit, but armed with a damn strong rifle. Gunslingers are your grunts—average health, average damage, average range—and in my experience are the ones most likely to die as they’re strong enough to fight in the front but easily killed in one enemy turn. Finally there are the Trenchers, the shotgunners, the guys who need to get in close but can thankfully push an enemy back with the force of their gun.This collection of types plays well off each other—almost too well. One makes up for the other’s limitations to such a degree that it’s tempting to think of them less as individual soldiers and more as different limbs of a single fighter. The game actually allows you to name each soldier, and provides backstory for all of them, but I was never that invested in them as individuals. They existed as cogs in my combat machine, each in their place and each with their role. The extra attention to narrative is still appreciated, however.The soldiers that do stand out as individuals are the elites you can pick up along your journey. These encounters are always marked on the map with a specific icon, so you know what you’re getting into, which is a nice bit of warning as these are very hard battles. A single elite can decimate your team if you’re not careful, but win the fight and they’ll join your crew, and boy are they worth the effort.That little warning before fighting an elite is indicative of Bedlam’s attitude towards the player: It’s more forgiving than most rougelikes. You can flee any battle at any time, saving your soldiers at the cost of some number of your civilian crew (who lose faith in you and abandon ship). However, this really only affects your ending score, or if you run out of meat it means you have fewer emergency rations at your disposal. On that note, if you do run out of resources the game gives you a Hail Mary shot at survival: You spin a virtual six-shooter in a game of Russian Roulette, with a 50/50 chance of death or a random event. The event isn’t a guarantee of survival. It can be anything from a helpful stranger to a sandstorm that kills you for good, but it’s the chance of survival that’s important. That chance encourages you to keep playing even if you’re having a bad run, because with the right roll of the dice you might get a second wind.Bedlam is also easier than most other roguelikes. The Normal difficulty is pretty brutal (the enemy AI is noticeably more aggressive and tactical), but Easy mode is, well, pretty easy. I got to Aztec City on my first playthrough of Easy with plenty of fuel and meat to spare. Yet this victory didn’t leave me entirely satisfied, I felt no desire to put the game aside now that I had “beaten” it because I knew it was going easy on me.There’s also a lot more content that’s locked behind the other difficulties. On Normal you can find other dozers, which allow you to play as those other factions, or you can hunt down King Viscera himself and free Bedlam from his marauding rule. Bedlam is more than just a game board, than just a space to move through, it’s a world of mystery and secrets and violence, and I want to see more of it. This journey is more important than the destination.Improvising is one thing. Improvising in a trio setting is another thing.

      "No one ever asked for a video game that was one part Roguelike, one part Oregon Trail, one part Mad Max, and one part tabletop miniatures game, but Skyshine is giving it to us anyway in Skyshineâs Bedlam. Bedlam was one of the biggest and most pleasant surprises for me at this yearâs E3 - not just a new IP, but nearly a new genre of game. It runs off the same engine that The Banner Saga runs on, but it couldnât be more different. While one tells the story of the mythic end of times in a world loosely based off of Norse and Viking mythology, the other is about highway battles, explosions, mutants, cyborgs, and a whole lot of guns.The concept of Bedlam is simple in an, âeverything is horrible in the futureâ sort of way. You live in a horribly overcrowded slum of a city in the post-apocalyptic future. For the longest time, everyone just accepted that this was the last bastion of civilization. But recently, a new rumor has started to make its way around the city, a rumor of a veritable paradise on the other side of the expansive desert wasteland only known as Bedlam. You command a group of road warriors traveling in a gigantic building sized truck called a Dozer. Your goal, make it to the fabled Aztec city before your resources dry up, or the Bedlam claims you.This is where the Oregon Trail and Roguelike elements come into play. Moving around the Bedlam is as easy as choosing a destination and clicking on it. Most destinations have a few resources at them, like food, or fuel, but moving to a destination costs food and fuel as well. The better your Dozer, the less fuel you spend, and the more people on the Dozer, the more food you spend. Of course, more people means more warriors in case you need to go into battle, and also more technicians which do things like upgrade your Dozer, your weapons, your ability to supply food, your special abilities, and more.Your food and fuel expenditures also change based on what race you choose to play. Playing as humans requires food and fuel in moderate amounts, but you can also play as rogue A.I. who require next to no food and a ton of fuel. Different races also have their own unique abilities and combat units as well.Get exclusive PC Game Trainers at Cheat HappensAs you move from location to location, a variety of different events will occur. Some of these events are simple meetings with merchants and travelers. Some are natural disasters like sandstorms and sunflares. Sometimes youâll be lucky enough to stumble upon an oasis or a couple of rogue travelers that would love to join your band. Usually, however, you will be confronted with marauders who want to raid your Dozer for all of its supplies.This is where things change over into a sort of miniatures game. Before battle you get to choose six of your most powerful warriors to lead the charge, and equip them with whatever guns and armor that you like. Then, you are taken into a map with a grid on it, which should look familiar to anyone who has ever played The Banner Saga before. After that, itâs time for strategy.Every turn you and the enemy get two action points. You can use an action point to either move a unit or attack with a unit. In short, starting a turn with an enemy in your attack range means you can deal double damage to it.The trick is that every class in the game has widely varying attack ranges. The sniper, for example, can only move 3 or 4 squares at a time and can only attack from a massive 6 squares away. Anyone closer than that canât be attacked. Melee units can move a ton of squares at once but can only attack the square right in front of them. Then you have shotgunners, who can move up to 4 squares and attack at 3 or 4 squares, and Gunslingers, who can move about the same but can attack a little bit further out.Every class appears to beat another in rock-paper-scissors style. Snipers do the most damage, for example, but also are hardest to maneuver into attack range. Melee units, by definition, need to stand in front of an enemy to attack them, and so you can use this knowledge to your advantage. Just maneuver a sniper such that its attack range is around another unit of your choosing. Then, when the opponentâs melee unit moves in to attack next turn, use both of your action points to shoot it in the head from range, taking it out before it can do any damage.As you kill your enemies and move on with the game, units will start to obtain veteran status. Veterans have more life and do more damage than simple grunt units, and when equipped with the right weapons, they can easily cut down wave after wave of enemies. Be careful, however, because once a unit dies, it is gone for good. If you put all of your eggs into one basket, equipping one veteran with so much stuff to be a powerhouse, one unlucky shot will leave you with no power, no items, and no chance to survive out in the wastelands.Oh, and did I mention that thereâs no way to save your game, at least not in a way that lets you continue when you die? You can save the game and put it down to pick it up the next day, but if you die you just go back to the title screen. No victory for you. If you do manage to beat the game, however, you get to play a New Game + with all your stats and items intact. Now your goal is to travel back to the overcrowded city of Byzantine, where you started your journey, in order to defeat the corrupt ruler that controls it.Yes, itâs exactly like Mad Max: Fury Road, and itâs awesome.Skyshineâs Bedlam is slated to come out for the PC in the Fall of 2015.System: PCDev: Skyshine GamesPub: Versus EvilRelease: Fall 2015Players: Single-playerScreen Resolution: 480p-1080pBy\nAngelo M.

      "Looks a lot like Fallout TacticsCame here to say this. This isn't ftl meets fallout. It's fucking pixelized fallout tactics.I think he is more referring to the selection of the Dozer and Ftl's ship selection and the fact that every race is unique with a backstory.I'm not sure what you mean by pixelized, but it looks like they're using flat shaded 3d models on hand drawn backgrounds.  Either way, it looks more 'Hi-fi' than Fallout Tactics, at least imo.  Tactics, BedlamIt's FTL's overworld map with Banner Saga's combat in Fallout's setting.It's really not. BEDLAM is much more simplistic than Fallout Tactics.It's not even pixel art :/If the turn based combats are as good as in Xcom, it can be interesting. But from that video, the level design was too empty / not interesting for turned based strategy. Also, I guess it's a matter of taste but the art of the games seems very 2000's cartoon.They're not.They're very Banner Saga and not in a good way.Personally, I really enjoyed Banner Saga's combat. Unfortunately, BEDLAM has retained almost none of the features of that combat I enjoyed. It's overly simplistic and the difficulty is far too capricious.Im having trouble figuring out how this is really connected to FTL. I thought the defining feature of FTL is the \"taking control of the ship\" aspect, not the fact that it's ever so slightly a roguelike.This seems more like a turn based strategy game, like final fantasy tactics advance. I might be too upset about the fact that this has almost nothing to do with strategic real-time-with-pause crew based vehicular post apocalyptic combat, but that seem to be a much cooler thing than what this really is.I think he got the FTL part from the random text events and the way you move across the world map. Fair enough I guess, but I agree that FTL is for me more defined by the very unique combat system (especially the controlling of a complex system in a pausable real time environment). On first glance something like \"Jagged Alliance meets Fallout\" seems more appropriate, but I don't think that gets as many views as an FTL comparison.I never played fallout (untill 3), did fallout 1 and 2 not have random encounters?They did. As you traveled the main world you'd be pulled into encounters that way. Whether it be a pack of Deathclaws looking for food or a special encounter with the TARDIS.Random events aren't FTL exclusive or made by them. They just handled and executed it in a well done manner that really fit in with the game. I still don't see how this game relates to FTL at all.Maybe from the sentence immediately preceding this? I mean, crewmates in a vehicle move from point to point on an 2D overhead map engaging in a mix of random and scripted encounters while overall danger increases. That is FTL-like. Also, like a few other games likely. I don't get why people are getting so bothered by loose analogies.The overworld map is more like FTL than pretty much any other game ever. You start at one side and need to get to the other, going from point to point, managing your crew and resources like fuel, with little events popping up along the way.It's just the combat isn't like FTL's at all, and that seems to be what's throwing people off.I've bought two games the past year that were hyped as like FTL. Neither were remotely close and both were huge disappointments.I'm guessing one of those was Convoy? What was the other? I really wanted to like Convoy but not enough random encounters and simplistic combat which boiled down to \"how fast can i push this guy off a cliff/into a wall\" let it down for me.Pixel Piracy and Sunless SeaWho described Sunless Sea as an FTL-like?The only similarities are that you manage a crew, but even that isn't anywhere near FTLs crew management.The creators of Sunless Sea said on their Kickstarter that FTL was their inspiration.They cited like 10 vastly different games as influences. They didn't claim it was FTL on a boat or anything.-Mitch HedbergBeing an inspiration doesn't always mean theyre going to be really similar. And wasnt there a free/earlier version of sunless sea out before hand people could play and see exactly what they were getting.Sunless Sea is all about the reading, not the gameplay. At least for me.Not played Pixel Piracy. I loved Sunless Sea though. Combat wasn't particularly exciting again but the narrative was wonderful and kept me playing. Also that soundtrack.. man...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd0Ct88V4xYDidn't bother with Pixel Piracy but I really enjoyed Sunless Sea, why didn't you care for it?It was just too slow and too text heavy for what I was looking for. It might have it's own merits, but it was not the pick-up-and-play, insane action that is FTL. Describing it as such was a vast misrepresentation and I likely would not have bought it otherwise.  I might have better things to say about it if I didn't feel actively deceived by the creators.Actively deceived? Vast misrepresentation? Are you kidding me?Believe it or not, the games actually are quite similar, and the inspiration is pretty obvious. But being in the same genre doesn't mean they should be the same game. They, in no way, deceived you, especially not actively. If you spent a minute (like literally one minute) actually researching the game or the developer, you would have known what you were getting into.Sunless Sea never, EVER claimed to have \"insane action\" or be \"pick up and play.\" I mean, it's a spin-off of Fallen London, for god's sake, and that's pretty much like playing a book.You don't have to like the game, but don't act like the devs lied to you.I've had a really great time with Dungeons of the Endless.Have you tried Convoy? I will probably pick it in next saleWait for it to be like a dollar. Seriously. I backed the game and had zero fun with it. It was subpar on all levels, a huge missed opportunity in my mind.My feelings as well.I wonder to what extent this is the result of a limited mechanical vocabulary on the part of the reviewer: referencing known games, without being able to separate core mechanics from \"mechanics present in a game\".It might also be an issue of audience name recognition, if he likened this game to wasteland 2, the comparison would be more accurate, which is more important (given the potential interested audiences) than ensuring more people get the reference.Still, if an individual wants to be taken seriously as a reviewer/curator, they need to be more exacting with their descriptions and summaries.I wholeheartedly agree, it seems low effort on the reviewer. I thought that we sorta got away from describing things like this back when farcry was called skyrim with guns.I'm pretty sure FC3's title was a legacy joke on Fallout 3's, the original Oblivion with guns (and far closer considering its the same engine). Or maybe some people are just stupid and took the joke seriously.Yeah the joke was that Fallout 3 would be Oblivion with guns! Partly because it was funny but also because people didn't have much faith in Bethesda to deliver the Fallout experience. It didn't end up being Oblivion with guns too much, for the most part.It seems more akin to an open-world, rogue-lite version of the Banner Saga that happens to be set in post-apoc wasteland, but maybe it's the double-wide elite unit he recruited and the animated art style that makes the comparison for me.They did licence the banner saga engineAh, makes sense. I wasn't sure because of health being de-linked to combat strength, but that fits more in a setting with prevalent firearms. Something about the food/crude system on the overworld map seems familiar as well.The overhead map, with it's randomly generated and scripted events you embark on, as you manage resources, and move to whatever end point- is similar to FTL.The combat is not like FTL. Also, it's not in space. Are these things not obvious? Maybe you're just bad with analogies?It's just that the defining feature of FTL to me is the combat. For fallout the defining feature for me is the setting, so it sorta fits this game. Thus I criticize the description of the game being FTL meets Fallout, because I don't think it is accurate portrayal of what it actaully is.I might be wrong in the expectation of what FTL would be, but considering that the rest of the comments here seem to complain about the same thing I think I'm at least partially justified. and to reiterate, I'm complaining about the title of this youtube video showing off this game, not the game. I think it's misrepresentative of the product, and on reading other people's opinions might be a thinly veiled means to attract a larger audience on the part of the video creator.Except the youtuber is the one who used that description, not the creators.And besides, that attitude is a little bit close minded. After all, before the FPS came the Doom clone, and before the open world game came the GTA clone. Just because a game uses similar mechanics to a previous title doesn't mean it isn't fun, or can't hold up on its own.The be fair, the developers mentioned that the game was heavily inspired by game such as FTL, XCOM and the Banner Saga on their Kickstarter page.Being inspired is different than being like a game.I dont think the intention is ever to be like a game.  When people pitch theses ideas, they throw games in the mix to give you an idea of what to expect.  That doesn't mean this game plays like Fallout, FTL, XCom, or the Banner Saga, but it helps give you a vision of what it could be like.If they wanted an FTL clone, they could have just re-made FTL and put a Fallout aesthetic over it.Not everyone knows the genre names. Comparing your game to other games would be a good way to advertise to the general population.Jeez, man. It's just a quick way to effectively communicate the jist of what to expect in the game in a single short sentence. Don't hold it against the game...And if you got the store page on Steam (where the vast majority of people will first discover this game) they don't list any other games at all, neither does the E3 trailer. It's not the centerpiece of the marketing in any way. I think you're just trying to turn nothing into something.That's not how it works, but ok.These are all appropriate comparisons for the different mechanics of this game, as I can see from the video in the OP, so what wrong expectations do you think have been set?Is some idiot going to read those 4 titles and think it's a space flight as you try to protect your ancestral homeland from invading aliens as you move your family to the American west? Shit, if the kickstarter people didn't make some of those comparisons, you'd see it in just about every review of the game you'd read. Because these are pretty simple and very broad comparisons to make in terms of game style and game mechanics.I don't think that having games be derivative works is really a bad thing, mediocre games can just as well carve their own path. the problem here is that describing something as a combination of other things is way too vague, and definitely not representative of the product being described for most people. though it is better to be described as your own thing than to be describe as the combination of parts of others.And anyway, most everything is in some way a derivative work.I've put in about ~8 hours so far into this game and right now I would say that the combat takes a lot of getting used to. In its current form it seems superbly unbalanced and unwieldy. It's not the \"rogue-like\" difficulty that's intense but once you've put time into you get a handle on it. This games strategic combat feels very stilted in its limitations and the factions' special abilities are incredibly strong, which makes it HARD but not in the sense that oh once I get the hang of it I'll be good, it's always just going to be hard due to balance issues and very obvious limitations. Again, I've only put 8 hours in. I've yet to complete an actual run, I've gotten pretty far on normal difficulty but we'll see how it goes. The management of upgrades and resources seems pretty okay, fuel being the hardest part to manage and easiest to use/waste up and cripple your run.Right now I feel like this isn't a game thats going to grab me and keep me playing like Risk of Rain and FTL and Dungeon of the Endless did. There arent very many unique events, you'll see the same ones run to run. The combat isn't as immersive and fun and gripping as the other three games I've mentioned. The balance of the game just feels difficult for difficulty's sake. I think at its CORE the game has something there and maybe in my next few hours of play I'll stumble onto something that'll keep me interested. As of now... I'm uhhh not sure it was really worth 20 bucks.I don't know why people are so focused on the title of the video.The game looks really fun, I didn't know it was coming out today, and I really want to pick it up now.Please read the reviews and watch some gameplay because this game is not the same quality.The same quality as what?  I watched the video that OP linked, and it looks fantastic.Looks wise is as far as it goes.I don't understand.I'm sorry for being so short winded. Really though,read some reviews and watch some videos. It is not a good game, at least in my opinion.I'll be honest. Whenever i see a sales pitch that basically describes a game as a combination of multiple other, more famous games - my interest in it all drops rapidly.With the multitude of indie games describing themselves in a similar way in the past several years, with the majority of them being disappointments - it now does more harm than good from a marketing perspective.I think it's important to distinguish between a DEV comparing it to other games, or someone else comparing it to other games.I went to a PAX panel where someone started describing their game to the panelist, and the panelist immediately told him to stop comparing to other games because you're just telling the person to play that original game.But it can be a great way of describing gameplay without too much need for extended description.  The best example I can think of is the Darksiders series.You now have a basic understanding of a game thanks to 3 other tentpole games.  If I started describing action/adventure with puzzles, z-targeting, loot, equipable items, lots of violence, and an anti-hero protagonist, you start to get a basic idea of Darksiders 2.  It's much easier to say Zelda + God of War + Diablo.See, I prefer the list of features to a combination of names though. What features does the game take from Zelda? What does it take from God of War? And now there's some Diablo in there? All the name drops tells me is what games the reviewer happened to be thinking about while he/she played. No game can include all of the features of three different games without becoming a convoluted mess, so I'm left wondering. Am I getting an open world game with a dark, edgy main character and a loot system? Or is it a top-down RPG laden with over the top QTEs? Will I be delving through dungeons, fighting endless hordes of monsters while a small, floating companion character shouts at me every minute? Do I even want any of those things? Geez this game seems way too convoluted for me, next review please!I'm not saying that one way is right and the other is wrong.  If you are interested in the game already (in your example, reading a review), then I 100% agree with you.  However, if someone had no idea the game existed and you want to explain it in one sentence to grab their attention, using big name games is a great way to do it.  After you have their attention, then tell them how the game actually plays.That is the definition of jaded. There is no issue comparing a games features to other games - it gives the uninformed user perspective and incite on the game they have not played.Granted, if that game does not live up to that description - they are going to be hurt by false claims. But that is on the developer and will only hurt them in the long run.A well informed gamer, even one who does the bare minimum of research, can see if descriptions like these are truthful or not. But to dislike a game because of a comparison is petty and dismissive.Edit: Also, in this case the FTL/Fallout comparison was from the streamer - not the devs. However, I believe the devs used a similar comparison as well.I played this game for about 10 mins at PAX. Which isn't long enough to have a great opinion, but I defiantly had some gripes. For one the combat was very strange. Almost everyone had a min-max range with their weapons, usually by like 1 tile. This meant if you are the gun slinger and someone is 4 tiles away you can't hit them. If they are 6 tiles away...you can't hit them. That makes sense for a sniper, but everyone? Also I felt fuel ran out way to quickly.Who is this reviewer?It's like he's trying to emulate TB/u/manyatruenerd.He's more trying to be /r/nerdcubed than TB. He's guy who did that Fallout 3 Kill Everything run a while back, and the New Vegas No Healing run.He is trying oh so hard.very mixed reviews on this game. I think I will stick to Convoy for my post apocalyptic FTL cravings.I don't get it. In this game you have soldiers with machineguns, dual pistols, shotguns, etc. And yet you can only fire at enemies that are two tiles from you, what's the advantage of a melee class? For once i would really love to see a game with a combat system like fallout, wasteland 2, Jagged alliance have.Mainly extra hp and movement speed. That said, if you can get a high level frontliner, you can smash faces really easily. Most other classes are slow, and have low hpIt's the new lovecraftian horror simulator with crafting, realistic water physics, and racing mini-game elements! It's Metroid meets cooking mama!Next alpha patch will add dragon breeding!Anyone who backed on KS not get their Steam key yet? Wondering how they are exactly rolling this out. Kind of disappointing that backers are still waiting for Steam keys while people who didn't back can just go ahead and buy the game and start playing.Check your email, I've gotten like three messges now reminding me its out and with a link to the humble key it gives youHUGE fan of FTL. HUGE fan of turn based combat games. I can't wait to give this a try. Any Kickstarter backers out there care to give their thoughts on this one? I would 100% have backed this on Kickstarter had I noticed the campaign before it ended.I backed it at tier 4 ($25), but it looks like they only gave out early access keys to those who backed it at the tier 5 mark ($30) and above. The began sending out Steam keys late last night, so any early reviews or gameplay videos of the game will come later tonight or tomorrow.The combat in this reminds me of XCOM/Wasteland 2. Could be pretty interestingI like the idea of this game, but the combat seems very clunky and just unenjoyable. I am not an expert when it comes to this type of games, but I can usually figure out how the game works pretty quickly (Xcoms, Fallauts, etc.). There are weird range limitations in this game and it is not very clear straight away where/who you can attack. It is simple, but unintuitive.The combat looks interesting if a bit unintuitive. While the 'two actions per round' system is of course very weird (most of the people in a combat just end up standing around without doing anything), I like that it enables you to beat a battle with less people if you choose to do so. More people only provide more meat to absorb hits with and more flexibility (due to different placement/skills).Can anyone who actually played the game for some time comment on it?[removed]Please follow the subreddit rules.

      "Last week, we asked Gameological readers to submit questions that we could pose to developers on the E3 2015 show floor. We picked four of our favorites (and carried over one from last year’s batch); those questions constitute The Gameological Questionnaire.It’s essentially Oregon Trail in a Mad Max-like post-apocalypse, but the strategy game Skyshine’s Bedlam wears a host of other ’80s-era influences on its spike-covered sleeve. That’s because every member of the veteran three-person team behind the game—which was funded by a Kickstarter campaign last fall—are huge fans of ’80s pop culture. I survived a short demo from Sam Gage, Bedlam’s creative director, who was also kind enough to answer The Gameological Questionnaire.The A.V. Club: What’s one thing in the game that took a lot of work to get right but that players might not notice?Sam Gage: That is a good question. I guess trying to get the combat to feel right, to feel fun. To get enough craziness in there to make it just feel very arcade-y and very fun. I think the thing we’re striving for the most is to keep it as simple and arcade-y as possible, like the fewest mouse clicks as we can do—and, you know, just get into the fun as quick as possible.AVC: It’s taken some time to figure out the balance of that?SG: Yeah, yeah. Snip this, snip that. Add this, Add that. Yeah, just getting the feel right, that game feel.AVC: How long have you guys been working on this game?SG: We started talking about development way back in February or January 2014. And we talked about it, we kind of thought about it, got everything going, and we finally sat down to do the Kickstarter that we launched in October. That was basically just getting everything ready, and “Here’s our pitch.” After that, it’s been about nine months of solid development, and we’re looking to do a release in September. So we’re launching in about two months, hopefully, two-and-a-half months.AVC: If you were to put a retro game playable into this game, which one would it be and why?SG: Galaga has always been one of my favorites. What’s the other one? Road Blasters, that’s another one of my favorites when I was a kid. You know, the car-driving game where the weapon comes down. That was my favorite. You had the gas pedal—that was super fun. But Galaga, that’s the classic one. That sacrifice play to let your ship get taken up by the guys, and you wait, and you finally shoot them, and you have dual shooters. That’s just one of the best game mechanics ever.AVC: How would you put it into your game if you could?SG: Well, most of our game is about sacrificing stuff to get better. That is one of my favorite gameplay elements, is, “Lose this to gain that.” That’s just fun stuff to me. Harsh decisions.AVC: If you had tried to make this game 15 or 20 years ago, what would you have had to do differently?SG: Absolutely nothing. We are actually making this game as if it was 15 or 20 years ago. We’re trying to make an ’80s game, like this is all Judge Dredd, Heavy Metal magazine, Mad Max: Road Warrior. You know, the new one’s out. It’s totally awesome, but Road Warrior, that’s the stuff that we grew up on as kids. Me and John Mueller, our artist, it’s what we love. Post-apocalyptic anything. Mad Max is just insane, so we want to capture that feel. This is the game we would have made when we were 15 years old, with all the stuff we wanted to see when we were 15.So, yeah, I want to see mutant dinosaurs and robots and cyborg zombies, and I want to see stuff blowing up all over the place, and I want my mutant puke monster to melt guys with their vomit. It’s fun stuff. We don’t want to hold anything back. We want the apocalypse to be fun. We want to be colorful. You don’t want to be oppressed. You want to get in there and be like, “Yeah, this is the apocalypse I want. I’m awesome. I’m bad-ass.” That was Mad Max. “I’ve got my car, I’ve got my dog, I’ve got my shotgun.” That’s a fun apocalypse, and we want to capture the same thing.AVC: If my resume included a whole summer spent just playing your game, how would I talk about it as valuable experience?SG: Well, you’ve got to prepare for the apocalypse. It’s coming. This is the year of the apocalypse. We’ve got Mad Max, we’ve got Fallout 4, we’ve got Skyshine’s Bedlam. I mean, you got to prepare for it. Zombies are coming. The nukes are coming. Who knows? I don’t know. It’s human nature. We’re preparing ourselves for the worst.AVC: All right. Apocalyptic preparation on the resume?SG: That’s right. Apocalyptic preparedness.AVC: If this game were the main course of a meal, what would be the appetizer and the dessert?SG: Meat and meat. The whole game is about getting meat. That’s all, in the future, everyone eats, and our director is vegetarian, so it’s even funnier.Killing bad guys in crazy, wacky ways is the cherry on top of the dessert for me. Like, melting guys with mutant puke.AVC: What’s the most outrageous way to kill somebody in the game?SG: Right now, all the normal classes, they have a random chance of doing a deathblow against the other guys. The frontliners will actually kick the enemy in the crotch and do an elbow drop, taking out the guy [with the] last hit. The trenchers, the shotgun guys, they’ll do an uppercut, launch the guy in the air, and he’ll fall and land on his neck. That’s fun. I think my favorite, though, is the electrocution. The Looney Tunes black skeleton back and forth, and then exploding, their bones fly everywhere, and just their skeleton feet are left standing. We want that Looney Tunes. We don’t want a blood and gore game. We want that, just, “Wait, what just happened? What just happened? Did you see that? Did that really just happen?” That’s what we want.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement",

      "Counter-Strike (also marketed as Half-Life: Counter-Strike) is a multiplayer first-person shooter initially created by Minh Le and Jess Cliffe as a mod for Half-Life. By the fifth beta, Valve Software started actively participating in the development and ultimately bought the rights to the game and offered the original developers jobs at the company which both of them accepted.After about a year in Beta stages, the first full release of the mod was published on November 9, 2000 and the game was also available at retailers in North America shortly thereafter, on November 14, 2000.Since the creation of the franchise, various sequels and spinoffs have been created, such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, and the latest in the series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.The fast-paced and team-oriented gameplay of Counter-Strike has stayed relatively the same throughout the years. In it, two teams, the Counter-Terrorists and the Terrorists, fight to complete an objective or eliminate the opposing team. Although basic, it is considered one of the most revolutionary online games of all time. The original Counter-Strike came exclusively with multiplayer, without computer-controlled players. Over time, however, several server-side modifications have added bots for in-game use and bots were officially introduced in its later successors, Counter-Strike (Xbox) and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero.Counter-Strike has been praised worldwide for its highly competitive multiplayer. The decision to make the game multiplayer only roots back to its mod origins. Doing a single-player game would have entailed much more work as new models and AI code would have been needed for enemies as opposed to a multiplayer game which requires considerably less work.[2]There are three official scenarios, each with their own teams, objectives, and maps. In all cases, the two teams are the Counter-Terrorists face off against the Terrorists.In the original retail release, a short single-player only training map was included but this was removed when the game was transferred to Steam.There are three official scenarios in Counter-Strike: Assassination, hostage rescue and bomb defusal. A fourth scenario, known as escape, existed during the Counter-Strike Beta. The scenario itself is still playable, but all of the official maps were removed prior to the game's release.In this scenario hostages are being held by the Terrorists. Official maps feature between 3 and 5 hostages, though most maps feature 4 hostages. The Counter-Terrorist team needs to rescue these hostages by escorting them to a hostage rescue zone. The Terrorists must prevent the hostages from being rescued. Victory can also be attained by eliminating the opposing team.This scenario features two bombsites and one Terrorist starts off with a C4. The bomb must be planted at either bombsite. After the bomb has been planted, it will explode after a certain amount of time. During this time, Counter-Terrorists may attempt to defuse the bomb and successful defusal will make the Counter-Terrorists victorious. If the bomb explodes, the Terrorists will win the round. It is also possible to win a round by eliminating the opposing team.This scenario is the least popular of the three and only a single map, Oilrig, is featured in the latest release of the game. In this scenario a single player on the Counter-Terrorist team takes the role of a VIP that must make it to a VIP escape zone. Some maps feature only one escape zone while others feature multiple escape zones. The Terrorists have to take out the VIP and successfully eliminating the VIP will yield victory to the Terrorists. Both teams have a restricted arsenal of weapons available for purchase. Like in other scenarios, victory can also be attained by eliminating the opposing team.Counter-Strike features a large variety of maps that take place in different environments including urban, arctic, jungle and desert settings. During the post-beta stages, maps were still rotated in the official distribution on a slightly smaller scale. Since the release of Counter-Strike 1.6, no maps have been added or removed from the game.It should be noted that the majority of maps for the game were created by people that were originally simply hobbyist mappers. When Valve Software later bought the rights to Counter-Strike and its content these became the first works published at retail for many of the level designers.[3]There are 25 official maps in the latest version of Counter-Strike.*This map was exclusive to the mod edition of the game.Counter-Strike features a variety of weapons, ranging from knives to shotguns and submachine guns. The weapons for Counter-Strike were chosen mainly based on two criteria. For one, the weapons had to be satisfying to use and they had to look and sound cool. The other criteria was realism and what weapons the factions would likely be using in real-life. The former of these criteria was given more weight than ensuring authenticity.[4]Inspiration for potential weapon candidates were taken from various movies.[5] For example, the movie Ronin inspired the inclusion of the Krieg 552 and M249.[6] Further inspiration was also taken from the movies Air Force One and the Professional.[5]Most of the information regarding the weapons themselves was sourced from the internet or from gun magazines.[7] Because limited information was available regarding some of the weapons, Minh Le had to guess how some weapons could have functioned when animating them and thus a few weapon models exhibit differences when compared to their real-world counterparts.[8]Counter-Strike notably features left-handed weapon view models. These models were made as left-handed because the creator of these models and the main man behind Counter-Strike, Minh Le, is left-handed and thus preferred animating the weapons from that side.[9] The game features a possibility of changing the models to right-handed, but as the models are simply mirrored from their left-handed counterparts they sport some inaccuracies when compared to their real-world counterparts.Counter-Strike features a total of 25 weapons, some of which are exclusive to the Counter-Terrorists and others which are exclusive to the Terrorists. The list also indicates the original name of a weapon from the mod release if applicable.Along with the weapons, there are nine pieces of acquirable equipment, three of which are grenades. If ammunition, the radio and the flashlight are to be included, the number of equipment is increased to twelve.Counter-Strike features a number of different factions that are aligned either with the Counter-Terrorists or the Terrorists. The only difference between factions of the same side is the player model that will be visible to other players. Thus for example on snow themed maps, players may favor picking the Arctic Avengers when playing as Terrorists due to their white camouflage.Player models for the Counter-Strike Beta had been created by Minh Le, however for the full release Valve Software stepped in to provide new player models because the old models were inefficient in terms of polygon count and texture sizes.[10] These models were created by Chuck Jones and Stephen Theodore.[11][12] In Counter-Strike 1.1 these models were enhanced with higher resolution textures and the C4 and the defusal kit were re-added to the player models.With the release of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero 1.1 on April 28, 2004 it became possible for owners of Condition Zero to use the enhanced player models in this game. Previously, there used to be no direct way of disabling these upgraded models.[13] In the update issued on February 2, 2013 it was finally made possible to toggle these models at will via an Enable HD models if available checkbox.[14] Ticking this checkbox will also replace all models used from the original Half-Life, including the scientist model sometimes used for hostages, with their HD counterparts.Each team has four available factions that players can choose as their third-person model.The game started out as a Half-Life modification on the GoldSrc engine. It went through numerous iterations and it grew in popularity to become one of the most popular first-person shooters of all time. During the fifth beta Valve Software decided to get involved and eventually purchased the rights to the game.On August 31, 2000 it was announced that Counter-Strike would be released as a retail product in addition to also being available as a mod for Half-Life.[15] The decision to turn the game into a retail product was made as it was felt that a retail release would make the game more accessible.[16] Valve Software also wanted to see how the market would react to a multiplayer product that didn't require Half-Life.[16]With the impending retail release, various legal issues had to be sorted out. One of these issues was the weapon names. They were changed to bogus names in order to avoid legal issues.[17] In addition to simply purchasing the rights to the game, Valve Software also had to approach each level designer and artist to secure the rights to the maps and textures. Some textures were found to have dubious origins and they had to be remade or censored, which lead to some changes in maps for the retail release.[18][19] While Minh Le had hoped that all maps would have been made part of the retail release,[20] Valve opted to only include some of the maps in the retail release. For the maps that weren't purchased by Valve, Minh Le decided to reimburse the authors out of his own pockets despite him having no obligation to do so.[18]Naturally, the new version of the game would also feature new content. Three new weapons were modeled for the release by Minh Le. Also, all new player models were provided by Valve Software.[10] Maverick Developments was also contracted to produce a training map for the retail version of the game.[21]In October it was stated that the mod version of the game would be released as soon as the retail version had gone gold.[22] On November 9, 2000 it was announced that the retail release had gone gold, thus the mod version was released.[23] The retail version appeared on store shelves in North America on November 14, 2000.[24]Much like during the beta stages, various patches were released for the game after its full release. Since Valve was now involved, updates that needed substantial changes to the engine were also possible. This included the introduction of a brand new spectator mode in Counter-Strike 1.1, voice-over communications in Counter-Strike 1.3 and anti-cheating technology in Counter-Strike 1.4. On June 12, 2002 Counter-Strike 1.5 was released which was the final version of the game available as a separately downloadable patch before the game was transferred to Steam.Counter-Strike had already made an appearance on Steam during early closed beta testing of both Counter-Strike 1.4 and the content delivery platform in early 2002.[25] In March 2002, this beta testing was also opened to the public.[26] However the use of Steam at this point was strictly for beta testing purposes and there were no plans to make the actual game available via Steam yet.[27] Valve had wanted to make the game available on Steam coinciding with the release of Counter-Strike 1.5, but they eventually fell behind schedule and the transfer to Steam had to wait until Counter-Strike 1.6.[28]In October 2002 the news were dropped that Counter-Strike 1.6 would initially be made available via Steam and that a beta test would precede the actual release.[29] Public beta testing was initially to commence in mid-November,[30] but the date was first pushed back to mid-December[31] until testing finally commenced on January 16, 2003.[32] However, due to overwhelming demand further beta admissions were quickly suspended since the Steam servers ran out of bandwidth.[33] Steam and thus the Counter-Strike 1.6 beta was made publicly available again on February 11, 2003.[34]The game would be updated numerous times during this beta test and Counter-Strike 1.6 saw the inclusion of new weapons and a completely new interface based on the VGUI2 technology by Valve Software. The official bot that was being developed by Turtle Rock Studios for Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was also beta tested by the public in Counter-Strike 1.6 between June 5, 2003[35] and September 9, 2003[36].[37] After over half a year of public beta testing, beta testing concluded on September 9, 2003.[38] The final release of Counter-Strike 1.6 was initially supposed to be released the very next day,[38] however last minute changes to the Steam network took longer than expected and the final version of Counter-Strike 1.6 was released on September 12, 2003 together with the Steam client.[39][40][41]Counter-Strike 1.6 ended up being the last major content update for the game and the version number is now commonly used as a title to differentiate the original game from the rest of the series. Since the release of Steam, various smaller patches have been released which have introduced fixes to bugs/exploits or smaller balance changes. A Counter-Strike 1.7 was planned for merging the online communities of Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero,[42] but such an update was never released.In 2007 an update was introduced that caused quite a lot of controversy even before its introduction: in-game advertisements.[43] Despite the negative reaction by the community,[44] these advertisements would go on to decorate parts of the interface and the walls of some maps for a period of six years before they were eventually removed in 2013 when Counter-Strike was transferred over to the SteamPipe content delivery system.On January 29, 2013 a beta of the game was made available for Linux and Mac OS X and on February 14, 2013 support for these platforms was officially released.[45][46]The sound effects for the game were primarily the responsibility of Jess Cliffe.[47] Sounds for the Radio Commands and the Announcer were in fact recorded by him.[48]Some sound effects were also done by other people.[8] For example, the sound effects for the M249 were contributed by an actual employee of Fabrique Nationale, the manufacturer of the weapon.[49]An advertising campaign was also launched by the publisher, Sierra Entertainment, in late 2000. This campaign saw advertisements for the game appearing in various gaming publications including Computer Gaming World and PC Gamer.[51][52] Sierra also launched their official website for the game on November 4, 2000.[53]Perhaps in an effort to increase the value of the original retail edition, other Half-Life mods were included in the package. These were Half-Life Deathmatch, Half-Life: Opposing Force Capture the Flag, FireArms, Redemption, Wanted! and Team Fortress Classic. All of these mods included only the multiplayer component.The official strategy guide for the game was published by Versus Books.[54] Other than including regular gameplay hints, it also includes 2D overviews of the retail version maps.[55] At the time of publishing this was quite useful since overviews weren't made part of the game until Counter-Strike 1.3.When Counter-Strike left beta stages and the first complete build was released, two different editions of the game were available: mod and retail. After the game was transferred over to Steam, both of these editions were discontinued and only the Steam version is still supported. Since the release of the Steam version, the legacy editions (mod and retail) have been retroactively referred to as the the WON version based on the name of the matchmaking service used by those editions.This was essentially the edition that was the most direct continuation of the beta releases. The mod edition of the game could be downloaded from the official Counter-Strike web site and required Half-Life to be installed in order to be playable.Because this distribution was a mod just like the previous beta releases, this edition of the game kept the real weapon names. Also, this edition had exclusive maps that were not included in the retail edition as Valve Software had not bought the rights to all maps.[56] The exclusive maps were Arabstreets, Dust2, Estate, Foption, Highrise, Inferno, Nuke, Rotterdam, Tundra, Vegas and Vertigo. Some of these maps were removed/introduced in subsequent patches.When Counter-Strike was transferred to Steam with version 1.6, this edition was discontinued.This edition was the first standalone release of Counter-Strike and Half-Life was not required to play the game. Since this edition of the game was like any other regular retail game release, Valve Software had to alter the weapon names and used made up names to prevent having to face legal issues.[17] On a more curious note, the names of two Terrorist factions were also slightly altered for this edition. It is not known why this change was made or why it was exclusive to this edition of the game.Valve Software had only bought the rights to some of the maps that were part of Counter-Strike, thus this release included fewer maps than the mod edition of the game.[56] Separate map packs were released via the official web site that added the missing maps to this edition.[57] However, the training map was exclusive to this edition of the game.[58]Older retail releases including the original Half-Life: Counter-Strike, Half-Life: Generation and Half-Life: Platinum Collection include this edition of the game.When Counter-Strike was transferred to Steam with version 1.6, this edition was discontinued.This edition of the game was based on the retail edition meaning that it uses made-up weapon names and the slightly altered Terrorist faction names. Compared to the retail edition many of the missing maps were added. The added maps were Dust2, Estate, Inferno, Nuke and Vertigo. Curiously the training map was removed.Newer retail releases including Counter-Strike 1 Anthology include this edition of the game.This is the only edition that is still supported and is still occasionally being updated. Owners of the retail edition or the original Half-Life retail release can migrate to this edition by activating the CD key on Steam.Counter-Strike has received generally favorable reviews, scoring an average of 88/100 and 89/100 on the aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings respectively.[59][60]Reviewers praised the teamplay and social aspects of the game. Scott Osbourne of GameSpot thought the round based gameplay allowed chatting dead players forming a sense of tension.[62] Clayton Wolfe of IGN thought that successful teamplay was the recipe for ensuring a victory for ones team.[63] At Computer Games Magazine, Bill Hiles stated that \"teamwork is crucial for success\" and noted that better players utilized coordinated team efforts to succeed in the game.[61]The choice of weapons was praised by Osbourne, with him stating that \"one of Counter-Strike's biggest appeals has always been the selection of weapons\".[62] Dan Watson of PC Gameworld thought the weapon modeling was excellent and that they handled realistically.[64]While Wolfe felt that the weapon purchasing system was frustrating at first, it quickly stated feeling like an enhancement to the online experience.[63] Watson thought the purchasing system brought a great deal of variety to the game, stating that \"one round may find you perched on a fire escape with a high-caliber sniper rifle, while on the next round you may choose to bust in the front door with a double-barreled shotgun\".[64]Journalists were torn on the graphical side of the game. Osbourne stated that \"the Half-Life graphics engine may be dated now, but Counter-Strike has always used it to its fullest potential\" and thought the new player model graphics were especially good.[62] Wolfe stated that \"visually the game will not disappoint\" even though the Half-Life engine was dated and thought the environmental textures looked \"realistic enough\".[63] Watson however thought the game had a noticeably dated look, stating that \"no amount of tweaking can disguise the fact that this engine is based on a two-year-old core, and a facelift would really work wonders\".[64]The weapon sound effects were well received by Osbourne, Wolfe and Watson. Scott Osbourne thought \"the guns sound remarkably realistic and powerful, which makes them viscerally fun to shoot\".[62] IGN editor Wolfe concluded that \"the realistic guns sounds are spot on\".[63] Watson thought the sound effects in overall were on par or superior to other games on the market.[64] However, Wolfe thought that the other sound effects used sounded wimpy and he had hoped for deeper bass and clearer sounds.[63]Generally, reviewer concluded that the retail release was a good buy for people who didn't own Half-Life or didn't have access to high-speed internet connections.[61][62][63] It was also seen as a good release from the point of convenience as everything needed to play the game online was available on a single CD.[61]As of December 3, 2008, Counter-Strike has sold over 4.2 million retail copies, more than any other Valve game besides Half-Life and its sequel, Half-Life 2.[65] Since Counter-Strike is also available as a modification for Half-Life, part of the Half-Life sales are commonly attributed to the success of Counter-Strike.[66] In fact, the sales of Half-Life increased year-on-year for a few years after its release which was very unusual at the time as most games had a shelf life of around 3 months. Gabe Newell attributed this pattern to the popularity of Counter-Strike and thought the release of the mod was the best thing that could have happened to Half-Life.[67]After its release, the game topped many lists as the most popular online game.[68][69] Even in 2015, 15 years after the release of the game, the game frequented the top 25 games played on Steam list and its longevity has outlasted both Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and Counter-Strike: Source.[70][71]Counter-Strike has won various awards. It won the Game Developers Conference Game Spotlight award in 2001.[72] The game was also granted the Game of the Year 2000 title by Gamers.com while Voodoo Extreme gave it the readers choice award.[73] Computer Games Magazine, Game Revolution, Electronic Playground and GameSpot (UK and US) all granted it the award of best online/multiplayer game of 2000.[73]Counter-Strike is considered one of the most influential multiplayer games of all time.[74] The game is also attributed to having pushed the competitive gaming movement forward.[75] It has also been reported that Counter-Strike was the first game for which a fantasy league was started.[76]Developer(s)Valve CorporationPublisher(s)Valve CorporationSierra EntertainmentPlatform(s)Microsoft WindowsMac OS XLinuxRelease date(s)June

      "Canals (de_canals) is a bomb defusal map featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.On March 15, 2017 Canals was added to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, along with the Spectrum Case and new models for the Phoenix Connexion terrorists.The map recreates the general area around Piazza San Marco (also known as the St. Mark's Square) in Venice. Recreated landmarks include Doge's Palace (Palazzo Ducale), Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri), St Mark's Basilica, St Mark's Campanile, St Mark's Clocktower, and the Columns of San Marco and San Todaro. [1]The base of St Mark's Campanile serves as Bombsite A, while Bridge of Sighs serves as Bombsite B.Canals is based on real-world environments and the idea for the map Canals originally came to Iikka Keränen after visiting Venice.[2][3] Originally, the map was called de_venice but despite the shared name, it was not related to the earlier cancelled Venice map by Ido Magal.[2] The aesthetics were intentionally given a clean and uncluttered look despite the real-world influence to enhance player visibility.[3]Creator(s)Iikka KeränenGame(s)ScenarioBomb DefusalMap GroupDefusal Group SigmaTerroristsPhoenix ConnexionCounter-TerroristsSEAL Team 6First appearanceCounter-Strike: Global OffensiveLast appearanceCounter-Strike: Global OffensiveThis article/section is under construction.While this article/section is still under construction.

      "Infinite Space Battle Poker is a hybrid cardgame that twists the mechanics and flexibility of poker into a head-on battle between mighty starships!  (Battle Poker features character, item and starship art from Digital Eel's Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars computer game.)  Note that this isn't merely a themed ordinary deck.  It's a completely diferent set of cards.  Here's how it works.First, any poker rules variant (draw, stud, etc.) may be used with the Infinite Space Battle Poker deck as long as the winner is determined by a standard five card showdown (each player shows and compares a five card hand).  (Tip:  We like using the Anaconda poker rules.)Second, rather than using standard poker hands (three of a kind, flush, etc.), the value of each player's cards is calculated as the strength of their fleet.  This result is affected by fleet composition, leaders, mercenaries and special cards.Card combat is E-Z to learn, and play results in a surprising variety of combinations.Five galactic races from the Infinite Space universe are represented as \"suits\" of a leader and several spaceships each.  Normally, ships of a single suit can be added together to determine the value of your hand.  Holding a leader of that suit adds +2 to the value of each matching ship.  Multiple leaders can be used to form a \"diplomatic hand\" while ignoring any ships.Where things get really entertaining is when the various non-suit cards come into play.  Mercenaries will simply work for whoever holds them.  The Mantle of Babulon allows an alliance between races, while the Chromium Gong can be used to destroy (discard) an opponent ship of your choice.  Finally, the Yellow Kawangi is a unique, powerful starship card that can take on an average fleet all by itself!Cheap and portable, requiring no batteries or internet, you'll want to carry Infinite Space Battle Poker with you wherever you go.  And remember-- it's the insterstellar card game that broke the Bank of Zelulig, the Pleasure Planet.  If it worked for Prince Arcturus, it can work for you!Advanced Search >$to                        $Browse Categories    Type        CCG        Stand Alone Game        Casual Games        Board Game Component        Entertainment Cards        Poker Deck Designs        Tarot Deck Designs        Gift Certificates        Publisher Resources        Bundles        Books About Cards        Strategy Guides        Tie-in Books        Tie-in Comics          Theme        Abstract        Brainy        Comedy        Fantasy        Historical        Horror        Nature and Animals        Sci-Fi        Sports        Superhero        Trivia        War and Battle          Age        Preschool        5 and up        8 and up        12 and up        Adult Only          Players        Solo        2 Players        3+ Players        8+ Players          Publishers        Digital Eel          Price   Pay What You WantFree$  to $     $('#nav-type').click(function() { $('#more-hider-f44546').slideToggle(); $('#nav-icon-type').toggleClass('widget-nav-item-title-icon-close'); }); \n $('#nav-theme').click(function() { $('#more-hider-f44547').slideToggle(); $('#nav-icon-theme').toggleClass('widget-nav-item-title-icon-close'); }); \n $('#nav-age').click(function() { $('#more-hider-f44548').slideToggle(); $('#nav-icon-age').toggleClass('widget-nav-item-title-icon-close'); }); \n $('#nav-players').click(function() { $('#more-hider-f44549').slideToggle(); $('#nav-icon-players').toggleClass('widget-nav-item-title-icon-close'); }); \n $('#nav-publishers').click(function() { $('#more-hider-publishers').slideToggle(); $('#nav-icon-publishers').toggleClass('widget-nav-item-title-icon-close'); }); \n\t$(function() { var options = { ajax : { rq_data : { filters : (($('#search_filter')) ? $('#search_filter').val() : ''), cPath : (($('#search_cPath')) ? $('#search_cPath').val() : ''), price_filters : [] }, url: 'includes/ajax/publisher_directory.php' }, item_title : 'Publishers', placeholder_text : 'Search Publishers...' }; $('#nav-counter-select-publishers').obs_filteredComboBox(options); });\n $('#more-hider-publishers').slideToggle(); \n  \n\n\nCard Creators\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nAscensionBoss MonsterButton MenMistborn House WarMurder of CrowsNumeneraPathfinder Adventure Card GameSpoils\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t$(\"#nav-community\").click(function() { $(\"#more-hider-comm\").slideToggle(); $(\"#nav-icon-community\").toggleClass(\"widget-nav-item-title-icon-close\"); });\n\t\n\n Follow Your Favorites!\nSign in to get custom notifications of new products!\n\n\n Recent History\nInfinite Space Battle PokerScanned imageThese products were created by scanning an original printed edition.

      "Infinite Space Explorers is a game of exploration and discoveries.  Fleets are moved from system to system on a star map.  New events occur, and new items and allies are found, along the way.  Conflict between competitive aliens is likely, and combat between starship fleets is almost certain.  All such interaction is handled by brisk card play.ISE is designed to set up and play easily and quickly, yet provide the essence of a star spanning galactic adventure.  Discoveries are randomized so each game is different.Infinite Space Explorers includes:ISE is based on the award winning indie computer games, Strange Adventures in Infinite Space and Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space and features the same oddball aliens, peculiar artifacts, exotic starships and artwork by Bill \"Phosphorous\" Sears.Please note that because of the particular board configuration used, ISE is played as either a two player game or as a four player game.  Rules for solo and three player games are not included.UPDATE: Infinite Space Explorers X-1 -- the first card expansion for Infinite Space Explorers -- has been released.

      "We have now reached our initial goal, but are still seeking funds for improvements to the game. See explanations of the Stretch Goals in earlier update.Latest update (4/28/2013): Success! Plus, art team members finally revealed!A long time (12 years) ago in a galaxy far, far away (a suburb of Seattle) three people working full-time in the game industry got together in their spare time and created something with a long name: Strange Adventures in Infinite Space. It was a genre-busting indie classic, with 8-bit graphics not because it was hip and retro but because I based its graphics engine largely on \"Windows Game Programming for Dummies\".Its strengths were in its quirky, humorous writing and the addictive nature of the short-form gameplay where your brutal defeat in combat would have you click the restart button rather than giving up. SAIS would soon be called \"The Perfect Short Game\" in an article by a Real Famous Game Designer and get all manner of accolades, followed by a sequel with an equally long name: Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space. In the meantime I had read up on OpenGL so the game was a bit easier on the eyes. It also made quite a splash and gained a cult following, partly because it was designed with user-made mods in mind.At its core, Sea of Stars is a single-player science fiction roguelike similar to Strange Adventures and Weird Worlds. Turn-based star map navigation is combined with a real-time combat system. The game provides a randomly generated open world for you to explore, and will only reveal a fraction of its secrets each time you play. There is no going back to a saved game - everything you do has a permanent effect. Death is frequent, but only makes you want to try again.Although Sea of Stars builds on the universe you visited in the earlier games, it is expanded with fresh new material and gameplay. Discovering the interactions between items, alien races, characters and random events will keep you busy for years - yet each session of the game is a complete adventure that you can finish in one sitting. To extend the game's longevity even further, we encourage people to make mods and even provide tools for it!One thing that has advanced since Weird Worlds is technology. I wrote a 3D engine for our previous game, Data Jammers: FastForward, and a lot of the code will now be reused to expand the Infinite Space universe into the third dimension. Other games and projects have resulted in a variety of subsystems, from procedural texturing to mundane data file handling. All kinds of fun and useful stuff.However, what will really set this game apart from its predecessors is what we are going to do within this expanded universe. The Sea of Stars will be more alive than before, both reacting to the player's actions and acting on its own. Locations like star bases will be real places with more to do than just trade items, and you may have to attack or defend one in combat. Individual NPCs as well as alien war fleets will go about their business that may or may not be aligned with your interests, and you will have to pick sides. Technology available to you as well as others will advance as time passes, including larger ships showing up.Of course, we won't forget the mod creators who helped make Weird Worlds great. Not only will all the content use standard file formats so you can use any editor of your choice, we will actually release tools to make things easier. This will ultimately evolve into a full-fledged mod editor within the game that will help you put it all together.Digital Eel is an independent game developer consisting of two guys, Iikka Keranen (programming, design, art) and Rich Carlson (audio, design, art). We have both been in the game industry since the 1990's and released a plethora of commercial titles while working on Digital Eel games on the side. Counting our video and tabletop games, Digital Eel has shipped sixteen titles. Between 2001 and his passing in 2012, we were joined by Bill \"Phosphorous\" Sears, a fellow game industry veteran and an amazing artist whose creative input will be sorely missed.Our games have won various awards, including four Independent Games Festival awards: Dr. Blob's Organism won the audio and visual art categories (2004), Weird Worlds (2006) and Brainpipe (2009) won in the audio category. Weird Worlds was also the Quest/Adventure game of the year at Game Tunnel and was nominated for the Seumas McNally grand prize at IGF.Sea of Stars will require quite a bit of content to be created, from starship models and character illustrations to music and sound effects. Without funding, it would be up to me (Iikka) and Rich to create all of it. Our estimated release date would be in the latter half of 2014, and Rich would possibly have to sell his cats to science.The good news is that there are several experienced artists as well as a great composer who have offered to work with us (Their names will be revealed when the project reaches its funding goal). With their help we can get this game done this year, and with your help we can pay them for it.When you make your pledge of $10 or more to support us, you don't just get the warm fuzzy feeling that comes from helping out an indie developer. You will also get goodies ranging from a digital copy of the game to tangible keepsakes that you will be able to pass down to your future descendants living on Gliese 581g. Check them out below.Digital copy of the game: Get Sea of Stars for PC as soon as it is released.Other Digital Eel games: At various pledge amounts we will throw in copies of our other titles, from PC games to board games. At the higher levels, your name and email address will be added to a list of customers who will receive every Digital Eel game as long as we keep making them! This is not a hollow promise; we intend to continue Digital Eel indefinitely.Beta participation: Get in the game before it hits the stores. The beta will start when the game is feature-complete but content and gameplay balance are still in development. Your feedback will influence the final product.Art prints: Receive a piece of Sea of Stars concept art or other art related to the Infinite Space universe. At higher pledge amounts, prints will be larger and more impressive. They will also be numbered and signed by the artist.Name a star or planet: Write your name among the stars! Every time someone plays the game they will be able to find at least one star and one planet named by Kickstarter backers. It could be your (last) name or a name you invented.Name a starship captain: Your name, or a name of your choice, is added to the roster of starship captain names in the game. These names may appear as the player character's name or a human NPC.Physical artifacts: Receive a solid piece of Sea of Stars memorabilia. These will be special, limited edition pieces only made for Kickstarter backers. At higher pledge amounts, the artifacts will be larger and more impressive with features such as gold plating.Create an item: Have an idea or even a sketch for a cool thing you want to find in the game? We'll work with you to create a lifeform, starship weapon, system or artifact as close to your concept as possible. One or more of these items will appear in the game each time it is played, so many people will see it!Create an event: Add your touch to the ever-changing story of Infinite Space. We will create an in-game event, mission or quest based on your idea.Appear in the game: We will create a prominent in-game character based on your photograph (yourself, a family member or friend) or sketch. The character may be a heroic space pilot, a villain, a star merchant... Our choice, but always someone you will regularly meet in the game.Design a starship or space station: We will create an in-game starship or space station based on your sketch or idea. These will be featured prominently either as ships you can command or space ports you can visit, or in a unique event or quest built around it. You will also receive a one of a kind, gold-plated metallic model of your ship or station as your \"physical artifact\".Your name in the credits: To recognize your generosity, the highest-level backers will have their names included in a special \"thank you\" section of the game's credits (you can opt out if you wish).In video game business, surprises are almost inevitable no matter how experienced you are. The largest risk is that the game could take longer to finish than expected, for example due to additional gameplay balancing required to make it more fun or to remove exploits. We don't wish to ship the game until it feels just right. If there were a significant delay, we would consider making a beta version available to all pre-purchasers in December 2013.Another possible source of delays is the amount of content required. If we missed our deadline because of unfinished content, it would be possible for us to slightly reduce the scope of the game for an initial release and then expand it in a free update. This would most likely be funded by the initial sales.Questions about this project?

    "title": "Darkest Dungeon",
    "text": [
      "Darkest Dungeon is a role-playing video game developed and published by Red Hook Studios. The game, following an Early Access development period, was released in multiple platforms on January 19, 2016, for Microsoft Windows and OS X, with a release for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Linux a few months later. An iPad version was released in August 2017. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released on January 18, 2018, while an Xbox One version was released on February 28, 2018.\nDarkest Dungeon has the player manage a roster of heroes to explore dungeons below a gothic mansion the player has inherited. Played out in a mix of real-time movement and turn-based combat, a core feature of Darkest Dungeon is the stress level of each hero that increases with further exploration and combat; a character sustaining a high stress level may gain afflictions that will hamper, or possibly enhance, their performance as an explorer.\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, garnering several award nominations, and went on to sell over two million copies.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt the outset of Darkest Dungeon, the player learns that they have inherited an estate from a relative who, while seeking fame and fortune by excavating the dungeons and catacombs beneath their manor, has unearthed portals to dark dimensions and released a number of horrific and evil creatures onto the world. As the current owner of the estate and the surrounding lands, the player must recruit a roster of adventurers and mount expeditions to cleanse the estate of its vile inhabitants.\nAs the player ventures into the manor, the dungeons below it, and the surrounding lands, they find their relative's memoirs telling of the terrible deeds he had done in pursuit of knowledge and power. Eventually, the player is able to send a party into the titular Darkest Dungeon, the source of the land's corruption, taking steps to reveal its ultimate form. Within the deepest chamber, the player encounters the disembodied spirit of their ancestor, who now remains as \"an Avatar of the Crawling Chaos.\" After defeating the ancestor's apparition, the party battles the Heart of Darkness - revealed to be the progenitor of all life on the planet. The party manages to defeat its physical form at great cost, but the ancestor's spirit reveals to the player that this has only delayed its inevitable awakening and, by extension, the end of the world. The ancestor explains that this is merely part of an endless cycle in the player's lineage, and that the player will eventually meet the same fate as he, and their descendants onward. The ancestor then accentuates this cycle by repeating his first words from the start of the game: \"Ruin has come to our family.\"\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a role-playing game in which the player manages a roster of heroes and adventurers to explore these dungeons and fight the creatures within. Prior to entering a dungeon, the player can use facilities in a town near the mansion to dismiss or recruit more heroes, send heroes to perform various activities that will heal them, gain new combat or camping skills, reduce their stress, or remove any afflictions that they incurred while in a dungeon, and buy and sell equipment and supplies to outfit their heroes, using money and loot gained during dungeon runs. Many of these facilities can also be improved to add more benefits or options to the player. The player can recruit up to twenty-five heroes on their roster at any time; each hero belongs to one of fifteen character classes, and has their own statistics and skills that can be upgraded over time. If a hero dies while exploring a dungeon, that hero is lost for good.\nSurrounding the Hamlet and the facilities that the player uses are four different areas that must be cleared before the Darkest Dungeon can be accessed. They are: \n\nThe Ruins: the ancient tombs and hallways of the player's ancestors, now crawling with skeletons and mad cultists, and host to a Necromancer and a mad prophet that are both there due to the Ancestor's machinations.\nThe Weald: the overgrown forest that surrounds the hamlet, now home to slime monsters, bandits, mad dogs, and cannibalistic hags.\nThe Cove: the murky caves beneath the cliff that the manor sits on, inhabited by fish-men and bandits, along with a Siren and a ghostly Pirate crew.\nThe Warrens: the sewers of the manor, filled with offal and swarmed with pig-men and other forms of misshapen flesh that are the misguided product of the Ancestor's first attempts at demon-summoning.Once enough heroes have been built up to the appropriate levels, they are sent into the Darkest Dungeon itself, where the final boss resides.\nOnce the player has completed preparations, they select four of their heroes to go explore a dungeon. Access to most dungeons requires completing several previous dungeons and collecting specific types of loot, with such later dungeons being more difficult than the earlier ones. Dungeons are procedurally-generated in a roguelike manner, and presented as a series of interconnected rooms with hallways between each. The parties move between rooms in a real-time, side-scrolling view, with the potential to discover interesting objects to search or random combat encounters during this time. When the party reaches a room, they may be forced into combat, but once clear the room remains a safe zone allowing the player to apply healing and other remedies to the party. When combat occurs, it plays out in a turn-based manner, with each character having their own order based on initiative that changes each turn. Heroes can use attacks, magic, special skills, or items during their turn to defeat the other party. The order which the party moves through the passages and rooms is critical as it affects who may interact with various items, and the available actions that a character can do while in combat; for example, a swordsman in the back of the party cannot easily attack, while range-attack characters like archers and mages can. The positions of heroes can be changed around, but this can consume time or a combat turn. While each dungeon has a target goal, the player can opt to leave the dungeon at any time, retaining all loot collected but forgoing the larger reward for clearing out the dungeon.\nA core element of Darkest Dungeon is its Affliction system, a concept of a hero's stress level or resolve. Though a hero will have little stress when they are hired, it will worsen from a number of factors encountered while in a dungeon, such as adventuring without food or light sources, seeing the death or wounding of a fellow party member in battle, or from blights cast on them by enemies. If the hero's high stress remains unchecked, they may develop afflictions that will interfere with the behavior of the character, such as being frightened and unable to fight directly. Less frequently, a stressed character may develop virtues that enhance their attributes, such as becoming more invigorated within battle. Some afflictions, left unchecked, may become permanent quirks that remain on the character. Other afflictions can be removed back in the village and by performing special activities, such as drinking at a bar or repenting at a church, that occupy the character's time, preventing them from being part of a dungeon party.  Allowing a hero to reach an extremely high stress level can cause them to have a heart attack, bringing them to the brink of death if not immediately tended to.  Stress can be lowered while in a dungeon through camping offered at specific locations, or other restorative items, as well as when back in the nearby town. While camping, the characters will have another set of available skills that can be used to help relieve stress and help with other party members.\nThere are two other game modes aside from Darkest mode, which is the \"Normal\" mode for Darkest Dungeon. The first is Radiant mode, designed to reduce the length of time to complete the campaign without compromising the core difficulty with the game. In Radiant mode, level limitations are less strict, the player gets to recruit stronger heroes and hero XP gain is accelerated. The second mode is Stygian mode, which is a much more difficult and challenging mode. Stygian mode not only has enemies with increased health and damage and an increase in light depletion, but a failure condition. Should the player fail to complete the game within 86 in-game weeks or have 13 or more heroes killed, the 'Thing' will be awoken causing a game over and the save file to be deleted. Also note that Radiant and Darkest mode give the player the option to toggle off gameplay features that increase the game difficulty, whereas the player cannot toggle these in Stygian mode.\n\n\n=== Downloadable content ===\n\"The Crimson Court\" DLC was released on June 19, 2017 for PC and August 22, 2017 for PlayStation 4, introducing a Courtyard environment, a new playable class, a faction with new enemies, five new boss encounters, as well as new trinkets and Hamlet upgrade buildings. Also of note is that a hero can be turned into a vampire via the Crimson Curse, a new status effect introduced in the DLC.\nThe next DLC, \"The Colour of Madness\", was released on June 19, 2018. Narratively, it has a meteor crash near the village that causes some of the villagers to turn into zombie-like creatures. This leads to new dungeons, monsters, and other aspects of gameplay. This will also add a new mode, a horde mode, where the player's party must survive as many encounters as they can against these new creatures.\n\n\n== Development ==\nChris Bourassa and Tyler Sigman had become friends while working at Backbone Entertainment, and had talked about the idea of building a game together, but their commitments to other studios left them unable to do so. During 2012 and early 2013, they had brainstormed a number of ideas for potential games to develop. In April 2013, they found they had the time to work on this project, and decided it was a \"now or never\" moment, forming British Columbia-based Red Hook Studios to develop the game. By 2015, their team included six people in addition to three more supporting their sound, music, and narration for the game.\nThe main gameplay of Darkest Dungeon started out as a tile-based game that had the player control a group of characters as they moved about in a dungeon, eventually transitioning into a combat mode when they had encounters. The two recognized that players would get bored of looking at icons of the characters' heads all the time via the top-down icons, which would not allow players to come to bond with the characters. This led to the concept of presenting characters from the side view in combat, making the player feel they were at the same level as the characters, alleviating some of these issues. This also enabled Bourassa, the principle artist on the game, have an opportunity to show off more of his work. However, this would have left them the need to transition from top-down to side-view and create more art assets. They worked around this by using the same side-view not only for combat but for dungeon exploration, creating the basic gameplay of Darkest Dungeon.The side-view mechanic then led into the idea of the characters being in ranks, allowing for certain attacks, abilities, or defenses if they were in the right rank; characters in the front could have powerful melee attacks but take more damage, while characters in the back would be more protected but limited to weaker ranged attacks. This was an idea inspired by The Bard's Tale, but they were able to expand upon it to create interesting situations, such as having characters pulled out of rank by an enemy attack. This in turn led to a new attribute for how likely a character could be moved out of position, creating strategies for the player as to handle a mix-up in the ranks during combat, as well as applying the same principles of rank to the enemy forces and making situations for the player to figure out how to take advantage of a weak rank arrangement. Furthering from these concepts, they crafted the character classes to have various strengths and weaknesses based on their rank positioning, created further strategic elements for the player to explore.One core idea of the game was its Affliction system, in which the dungeon-crawling characters would gain stress and eventually afflictions as they explored. Bourassa and Sigman noted that while they are fans of classic role-playing games such as The Bard's Tale, Eye of the Beholder, and Ultima Underworld, most of these games lacked the human element to the characters. They give an example of a character being down to their last hit point in battle and the player simply making decisions to win, the character reacting regardless of their low health. They instead wanted to \"toy with player agency\", giving moments where the player is reminded they do not have full control of the actions of the adventurers in the party. They also sought to alter how most loot systems in role-playing games work so that the player was not always focused on finding the best gear for the characters but instead working to support their characters. Bourassa and Sigman were aware that these facets may turn players away from the game due to the difficulty and inability to have full control, but continued to stay true to their vision of the game.The Affliction system was inspired by  psychologically traumatized heroes, both through historical events as well as works of fiction such as Hudson from Aliens and the soldiers from Band of Brothers who are transformed by the horrors of combat; Sigman pointed to the seventh episode of Band of Brothers where a soldier watches his friends die from a shell explosion, stares transfixed at the event, and then becomes unable to fight any more, as the feeling they wanted to capture. Though they were also inspired by Lovecraftian horror, they did not want to use the concept of \"insanity\" that is common in that genre, and instead focused more on the nature of stress and how it affected the human psyche. Because of the importance of the Affliction system to Darkest Dungeon, the developers spent significant time to make sure that the impact of stress and afflictions were emphasized dramatically in the game's presentation, using special graphics and sound cues to signal the onset of an affliction. They also created a \"bark system\", dialog stated by a character reflecting their current stress, affliction, and other attributes as another means to humanize the characters and remind the player that they do not have full control of the characters. Alongside the Affliction system, they developed the town facilities that are used to cure afflictions and reduce stress, using concepts they borrowed from tabletop games. They also included Virtues, positive afflictions that can result from high stress situations, and a means of tracking the afflictions of a given character over time, so that in future stress situations the character will often become encumbered by the same afflication, developing a behavioral pattern that the player may be able to use to their benefit.A disembodied narrator, voiced by Wayne June, was also included to comment in a sardonic manner throughout the game, furthering the atmosphere they wanted. Bourassa had listened to June's readings of various H.P. Lovecraft works prior to developing the game, which partially inspired Darkest Dungeon. When the two were preparing the game's first teaser trailing, they felt they needed a narrator and approached June for his work. Once the trailer was completed, they recognized that June's voice as narrator was a necessary element for the game. Art assets were created by Bourassa; in addition to the Lovecraftian nature, he wanted to give the game the look of woodcut and illuminated manuscripts, and took inspiration from eastern European artists such as Albrecht Dürer. He further modernized the look by using ideas from comic book artists including Mike Mignola, Guy Davis, Chris Bachalo, and Viktor Kalvachev. The game uses a homebrewed, lightweight cross-platform game engine developed by programmer Kelvin McDowell.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nBourassa and Sigman used their personal savings to fund the creation of Red Hook Studios, and sought to gain a grant from the Canada Media Fund, but were rejected. Having originally anticipated an eighteen-month development period, they sought a way to fund the extended development period. They launched a Kickstarter campaign in April 2014 for funding; prior to starting the Kickstarter, they made sure they had prepared enough of a media interest, including a trailer for the game released in October 2013, to attract attention at the onset of the campaign. Due to the early marketing, the funding goal of $75,000 was reached within the first two days of the campaign, and completed with over $313,000 of funding from over 10,000 backers.Darkest Dungeon was released on Steam Early Access on January 30, 2015 for Early Access backers, and Steam Early Access on February 3, 2015 for the public. They used feedback from the Early Access period, particularly through those that streamed their playthrough of the game, to help with playtesting and adjust the balance of the game, while also finding that their approach to gameplay and presentation was validated by positive reception from these streamers. Sigman noted that developing in Early Access was comparable to \"working while naked in a transparent cube suspended above Times Square\", but felt their transparency with players made the final product much better. Bourassa and Sigman noted that they had had some issues with user feedback during Early Access, specifically after they added two gameplay elements around July 2015: the addition of corpses which affected combat positioning issues, and the possibility of a stressed character suffering a heart attack and dying immediately. Some Early Access players were dissatisfied with these changes, feeling it put the player at far too much disadvantage to an already difficult game, and complained to the studio. Bourassa and Sigman had debated what to do with these two features and eventually opted to make them optional elements to gameplay. Though this change was generally met with approval, a number of these players remained bitter about the game throughout the rest of its development, and attempted to have the studio's and the game's reputation derided by Jim Sterling, who has frequently been critical of Steam and Early Access titles; Sterling instead found the game to enjoyable even with this change. Bourassa and Sigman recognized they could have done a better job in the social media to placate the complaints early on, but still felt they chose the right path with retaining these features and sticking to their vision instead of trying to meet all expectations from Early Access players.Though Red Hook anticipated releasing the game in October 2015, a personal loss affected one of the team members, and the game was subsequently released on January 19, 2016 for personal computers. A cross-buy version for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita were originally planned for release in the second quarter of 2016, but was pushed back to Q3 2016 to improve playability with the Sony controllers as well as to prepare these versions to align with new features to be introduced in the personal computer versions prior to this release. This version was released on September 27, 2016.The game's first major update in May 2016 following its full release, \"Everything Burns\", which among bug fixes and other small improves, adds in Town Events, where upon return to the town the player may encounter a random reward, such an extra recruit to join their party, or the temporary closure of one of the town facilities. Following on the previous issues with Early Access updates, some of these features can be eliminated or their frequency reduced in the game's options menu.The game's first downloadable content, \"The Crimson Court\", was released on June 19, 2017 on personal computers with the PlayStation 4 version to come later. The new content added a new hero class, a new dungeon type, new enemies and bosses, and other similar content to the game. Integration with Steam Workshop was added in an April 2017 update. Red Hook plans to develop additional downloadable content, to develop for other platforms, specifically highlight touch-based devices as they found their interface is already well-suited to this input mode.A version for iPad was released on August 24, 2017. This version will allow players to transfer save files from the personal computer editions to use with the iPad version. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released on January 18, 2018 via Nintendo eShop, alongside availability of \"The Crimson Court\" and \"The Shieldbreaker\" DLC. An Xbox One version is planned for release on February 28, 2018; it will initially be released as Darkest Dungeon: Crimson Edition which will include the \"Crimson Court\" content at a discount; after two months, that version will be replaced with the base game with additional DLC, including \"Crimson Court\", that can be purchased, as well as an Ansectral Edition that includes all DLC.Merge Games will produce a physical retail release for both PlayStation 4 and Switch versions, subtitled as Ancestral Edition and include both DLC expansions. It is expected for release in Q2 2018.Another DLC, The Color of Madness, was released on on June 19 2018 for the PC version of the game\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game received generally positive reviews on its full release in 2016, holding a score of 84 out of 100 on Metacritic. The Escapist awarded it a score of 4 out of 5, saying \"Darkest Dungeon will kill your party, drive you insane, and leave you a gibbering mess at the Sanitarium. Yet it's so compelling and rewarding at the same time, you won't be able to resist diving back in for one more quest.\" IGN awarded it 9.1 out of 10, saying \"Darkest Dungeon is a punishing and awesome game of tactics, management, and pushing your luck to the breaking point.\" PC Gamer awarded it 88%, saying \"A wonderfully executed, brilliantly stressful reinvention of party-based dungeon-crawling, Darkest Dungeon is great fun, even when it’s cruel.\" GameSpot awarded it a score of 9 out of 10, saying \"Darkest Dungeon plays the long game. It builds you up for a grand bout that will test everything you've learned, as well as your ability to plan several in-game weeks out.\"Red Hook Studios reported that a week after the game's 2016 release, over 650,000 copies of Darkest Dungeon had been sold, including those from Kickstarter backers and Early Access purchases. In November 2016, about a month after the release of the PlayStation versions, Red Hook announced the game had sold more than one million copies across all platforms. By December 2017, all versions combined had worldwide sales of 2 million copies.Darkest Dungeon was nominated for three 2016 Independent Games Festival awards: the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and for Excellence in Visual Art and Audio. It was nominated for the Most Fulfulling Community-Funded Game for the 2017 SXSW Gaming Awards. At the 2017  National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards the game won the award for \"Game, Original Role Playing\", whereas it was nominated for \"Performance in a Drama, Supporting\" for Wayne June as the narrator. At the same NAVGTR Awards the following year, The Crimson Court DLC was nominated for \"Game, Franchise Role Playing\" and \"Performance in a Drama, Supporting\" for June.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

      "Despair overtakes you as your houndmaster misses an all-important attack on an enemy fusilier, the lighter of the brigand’s massive boss cannon. The cannon is going to fire this turn, and there’s nothing left you can do to stop it. While your leper and bounty hunter land the finishing blows on the massive machine, your plague doctor and houndmaster fail to survive the encounter, joining the legions of the dead that occupy the hamlet’s graveyard. Dead champions never return, but their memory will haunt you through all the battles and dungeons yet to come.Tremendous highs and tumultuous lows combine in the Lovecraft-inspired, turn-based dungeon-crawler Darkest Dungeon. You’re always one hit point or one mind sliver away from complete collapse as you explore winding halls of ruins, warrens, coves, and the titular Darkest Dungeon itself. Featuring permadeath, procedurally generated levels, and some aspects of permanent progression as the player builds up the decrepit hamlet into a bustling economy, the game is ultimately about finding combinations of curious glory seekers and treasure hunters and putting them to work against swarms of deadly and debilitating monsters.This dread ensemble is a pleasure to manage down to the finest details. With 14 different classes to choose from, each with many unique abilities, weapons to customize, skills to upgrade, quirks to manage, and diseases and afflictions to cure, you’re always managing something.With perseverance, you can even the odds against the nightmares ahead. The game strikes a brilliant balance most of the time, constantly testing the player to weigh resources and risks, but training a fresh team after a massive loss can be time consuming and punishing. This too, can be an important lesson: In Darkest Dungeon, discretion is often the better part of valor, and while mechanics make cowardice costly, it’s far better than losing a team to the grave forever.Your hamlet will continue to improve even if your characters continue to head toward the grave, as most standard dungeon runs offer resources to help you upgrade your facilities. It’s an important and satisfying mechanic that gives some sense of progression even in the face of overwhelming odds.Darkest Dungeon tweaks the traditional task of managing character hit points by adding another element called stress. Darkness, enemy attacks, critical strikes, and watching comrades fall can all cause despair.A full stress bar gives the hero a chance for greatness in the face of terror, but the more likely outcome is a serious malady such as masochistic or antagonistic tendencies, which could lead your characters to injure themselves, become unresponsive to your orders, or chastise the rest of the team into deep depression.Managing these two resources along with light sources, provisions, and other supply items as you traverse the depths makes for an insightful lesson in risk-management, and it feels wonderfully satisfying when you deliver the deathblow to a crawling chaos. Depending on the dungeon run, your heroes may come back with diseases, maladies, or stress that should be taken care within the hamlet before sending them out to venture again, making the construction of many different teams a necessity so some can adventure while others rest.Darkest Dungeon boasts plenty of substance and style, but if you’re averse to crushing difficulty it may prove to be too frustrating to be palatable. The uncompromising difficulty and challenge will be attractive to some, but could put off players looking for a simple crawler where you can outlevel or outgear content, and the sometimes grindy nature of recouping losses can take its toll.Darkest Dungeon is an incredible take on the classic dungeon crawl. The game brings Lovecraftian lore to new heights with cool classes, powerful narration, stylish art, and addictive gameplay that will keep you crawling back to battle slithering monstrosities even as your favorite heroes become corpses.© 1991 to \n  document.write(new Date().getFullYear());\n Game Informer.

      "Darkest Dungeon is a new roguelike RPG from a new studio called Red Hook Studios. The goal of the project was $75,000, but the game has managed to get over $250,000.Backers flocked to the kickstarter, and it was funded within twenty four hours. If your wondering why it's because the developers are promising something new.Don't believe me here is a brief description.So to get more information on the game I asked for an interview, and they agreed. I had the chance to ask a few questions from our community, and a few I asked myself.RPGWatch: Thank you for agreeing to the interview. Can you give a short description on your game company, and your game Darkest Dungeon?Red Hook Studios: Thanks for the chance to talk about our project!  Darkest Dungeon is an unconventional gothic roguelike that puts a heavy emphasis on the stress levels and emotional state of its heroes.RPGWatch: Were did the idea or inspiration for the game come from?Red Hook Studios: We wanted to take the beloved dungeon crawling genre and look at it from a different perspective.  We thought it'd be a fun exercise to deliberately avoid the most fundamental assumption that many of these kinds of games make.  Namely, that your hero is a mindless avatar who is completely fine with a lifetime spent crawling around in the dark, fending off murderous hordes of awful creatures.  We want to create a game about flawed, human heroes – not immutable killing machines.RPGWatch: Can you name your top 3 CRPGs?Red Hook Studios: Eye of the Beholder 2, Ultima V, & Darklands number among our favs, but it's really hard to boil it down to just 3!RPGWatch: So why did you decide to use Kickstarter for your game?Red Hook Studios: It's a fantastic way to not only secure funding for a project, but also to market test a concept, and build a community.  We've really enjoyed participating in the ongoing dialogue with our backers via the comments section.RPGWatch: What's your opinion on crowd-funding, and do you think it's a viable alternative to publishers?Red Hook Studios: Crowd funding certainly opens up possibilities for small teams making interesting, sometimes risky games.  But that said, I don't think they have to be mutually exclusive.  Demonstrating that your project has great appeal and a supportive fan base might, in some cases, lead to a publishing arrangement.  I think both paradigms can coexist, but I'm thrilled that crowd funding has established itself as a legitimate platform.  More options for small teams is always better.RPGWatch: Your game was funded in almost twenty four hours were you surprised by the amount of pledges, and support from the community?Red Hook Studios: I was surprised, no question.  We had tried to build some momentum beforehand, and let our mailing list know prior to launching the campaign.  Our hope was that we'd get a strong day 1 showing, and take some of the stress out of the rest of the campaign.  To be funded and blast through the first couple stretch goals in the first 48 hrs was mind-blowing.  I don't think I looked away from my monitor for the first 15 hours.RPGWatch: Was the original funding goal of $75,000 enough to fund the game?Red Hook Studios: It was enough to create the simplest incarnation of the game that still delivered on our gameplay promises, yes.  All of us on the team have gone without pay for 9 months now, and that investment, coupled with 75k from kickstarter would have been enough to get us to the finish line, albeit with a much smaller scope than we would have liked.RPGWatch: How did you guys decide on what stretch goals to offer, and how did you calculate the cost of each one?Red Hook Studios: We took the game we wanted to make, and stripped out all the noncritical features, making them stretch goals.  This ensured that even getting our basic ask of 75k would mean we could bring a product to market.  Costs are tricky to calculate, but we made sure that we weren't committing to a feature that would cost more than the stretch amount.  You don't want to finish a Kickstarter campaign, only to realize you can't afford to do what you promised!RPGWatch: I always like to get an inside look at Kickstarters form the developers point of view. Can you share anything you have learned so far?Red Hook Studios: I think the main take-aways from our campaign are to build an audience early, demonstrate your commitment to the project by virtue of having something concrete to show, and think very carefully about your reward tiers.  The last thing you want is for your Kickstarter campaign to be your announcement party – showing up cold on the internet and asking for pledges is a harrowing prospect.RPGWatch: Roguelikes often have permadeath, and generated dungeons will your game follow the same pattern?Red Hook Studios: Yep – we've got both those things.  Death is something players will have to get used to. You'll manage a roster of heroes, like X-Com, so when one or two pass away, you'll want to sub in some qualified replacements.  As far as dungeons go, not knowing whats around the corner is integral to our experience, so we'll be making use of procedural content, peppered with some set-piece encounters.RPGWatch: What do you think is the best the best, or most unique feature of your game?Red Hook Studios: Two things, actually – I think our Affliction system really helps us stand out in the dungeon crawling genre, and I think our side-view rank based combat is really fresh and strategic.RPGWatch: I'm sure you answered this question before, but could you talk a little bit more about the camping system?Red Hook Studios: Camping essentially represents a respite from the trials of dungeoneering, and provides players an opportunity to mitigate some of the corporeal and psychological damage done to their party.  In the dungeon, camping can occur in most rooms (once any threats have been dealt with).  Heroes have specific camping skills which can only be used in this phase of the adventure – things like 'bandage' and 'encourage' are available to all hero classes, while more tactical and powerful skills are restricted on a class by class basis.  The Plague Doctor, for example may have 'Leeches', a risky all-or-nothing heal.  For his part, the Highwayman can steel his own resolve by polishing his flintlock, but while it benefits him, there is no gain to the party as a whole.  Players are limited by 'rest points', and will have to carefully consider which camping skills to use.RPGWatch: Can you go into more detail on the affliction system, and how it will affect gameplay?Red Hook Studios: When a hero reaches the top of his or her stress tolerance, they do an affliction check, and can either shake off the stress, activating their personality-based heroic moment, or they can fall victim to it, becoming ‘afflicted’.  Afflictions are broken up into families – depression, abusiveness, selfishness, etc – things that people tend to do when they are extremely stressed.  An afflicted hero may not always do what you tell them to, or may act out in unpredictable and undesirable ways!  Eating more than their share of food, striking a fellow adventurer, wandering off in the night, or just constantly complaining.  Their actions in turn have an effect on the other heroes, completing the gameplay loop.RPGWatch: Party members will have there own personalities, and opinions. How will they interact with each other, and how will they conflict?Red Hook Studios: Each hero in Darkest Dungeon is a distinct entity with his or her own set of quirks, strengths and predisposition towards a particular affliction.  Additionally, each hero has their own stress meter, which responds dynamically to virtually everything in the dungeon.  As heroes become more stressed, and ultimately afflicted, they begin to act out in a variety of ways outside of player control.  We are aiming to create chains of interaction stemming from the circumstances that the heroes find themselves in.  For instance, opening an iron maiden may send the Vestal off the deep end, causing her to become Abusive.  She in turn, might lash out another party member, causing stress and damage.  Conversely during camping, players can look forward to heroes discussing how they are doing, and what their concerns are - “uh...is that all the food we brought?”.RPGWatch: How will the town work in the game? What can you accomplish in it,and how does it fit into the games story?Red Hook Studios: The town is integral to both the story and the gameplay loop.  It provides a base of operations from which the player must recruit, train, upgrade and manage her roster of heroes.  Stress is crucial and persistent mechanic in our game, so heroes returning from the dungeon might need time in the tavern, the church, or the sanitarium to recover from their experiences.  We've gone to great lengths to make the town gameplay a legitimate and engaging part of the experience – no selling off your gray loot and warping back to the dungeon!RPGWatch: Can you give some details about your progression system. How much freedom players have to customize their characters, in terms of attributes, perks and equipment?Red Hook Studios: Players can rename their characters, upgrade their weapons and armor, as well as find and equip different (stat altering) trinkets.  Hero's combat and camping skills are also upgradeable, allowing players to experiment with different skill loadouts.  Perhaps most importantly, however, real character customization in Darkest Dungeon is a function of the heroes' experiences in the dungeon.  Quirks, heroic traits, and afflictions all manifest based on experience, and result from your decisions as a player.RPGWatch: Will fights always be of 1-4 enemies, with a formation of 2 in the front row and 2 on the back, or we might see some surprises?Red Hook Studios: We haven't shown everything just yet :)  Players can look forward to large, 2-spot minibosses, huge 4-spot bosses, and massive variety of encounter types.  I don't want to say much more just yet, but I'm personally very excited about where our combat is going!RPGWatch: Do you have any plans for DLCs, or expansions after the game gets released?Red Hook Studios: Currently we're focused entirely on the 1.0 release.  Obviously, if the game does reasonably well upon release, we'd love to support it with additional dungeons, hero classes, new skills and (of course) enemies and affliction types.  Right now, however, our eye is focused exclusively on making a great core game.RPGWatch: What's the intended play length? A short campaign that's easy to fail, like FTL, or a long descent into madness that few players will ever see the end, like more traditional roguelikes?Red Hook Studios: You maintain a roster of heroes in pursuit of a larger meta-goal, so it's closer to X-Com than say a pure roguelike or something like FTL.  We haven't really spec'd the total time it will take to complete the campaign, but given it's procedural nature, and inherent re-playability/new game+, it's a game you can sink as much time as you have into!RPGWatch: Do you want to add anything before we finish the interview?Red Hook Studios: We want to thank everyone who supported, pledged, tweeted, emailed and otherwise helped our campaign in any way.  We feel very lucky to have had such support from our burgeoning community.  If anyone reading this hasn't seen or heard of the game before, we'd love for you to check out our KS page.  And of course, thanks to you & RPGWatch for the interview!So if you still haven't backed the game the Kickstarter will end on March 14th. I wil finish the interview with my new pledge \"In Kickstarter I trust\". I mean it to I'm not joking.",
      "I’ve always loved difficult games. From the nail-bitingly complex Dwarf Fortress to The Binding of Isaac to Bloodborne and Furi, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of beating a level, puzzle, or boss, and knowing you overcame a challenge with nothing but skill. Even when things go wrong, and the game seems unfair, you know it was your fault for not taking the proper precautions, reacting slowly or making the wrong decision – and when you eventually pull through, victory is all the sweeter.Today, we’ll be looking on the opposite end of the spectrum – at a game that punishes even the best players and instils a sense of dread and hopelessness in all who lay their hands on it. It’s pretty wonderful.Chris Bourassa, Creative Director and co-founder of Red Hook Studios, describes Darkest Dungeon in grave, yet thrilling terms:‘Darkest Dungeon is a gothic roguelike RPG that explores the stress and trauma that might result from a life spent fighting monsters in long-forgotten tombs, catacombs and other awful places.  Steeped in cosmic horror and occultism, the game challenges players to recruit and manage a roster of heroes, grouping them into parties and sending them out on expeditions to reclaim their family’s estate. Unlike many RPGs, however, the heroes in Darkest Dungeon are human – flawed, and disadvantaged against the legion of supernatural antagonists that they must face.  Combat and exploration take a mental toll on the adventurers and players must manage their roster’s mental as well as physical wellbeing in order to succeed.’My first couple of hours with Darkest Dungeon were a harrowing experience. After an encouraging first expedition into the old, abandoned halls beneath my family manor, I got cocky. If I had enough torches, food, and bandages, I told myself, my tight-knit team of adventurers – and gamer’s intuition – would take care of the rest. I couldn’t have been more wrong. My team was confronted by a group of Lovecraftian cultists hurling eldritch magic – leagues above what my simple Crusader, Highwayman, Vestal (healer), and Plague Doctor were capable of. Though we dispatched the cultists, one of their spells had a permanent effect on my Vestal: she became abusive, throwing insults at her teammates wherever possible, raising their stress and making it easier for them to succumb to Darkest Dungeon’s many Afflictions. Shortly after that, my Highwayman lost all hope, my brave Crusader became a snivelling coward, and my Plague Doctor skulked off to the nearest tavern for a long, hard drink.Oh, well. There’s always more fodder– I mean heroes, arriving by wagon.As you might expect, Darkest Dungeon is famed for its mercilessness, turning against the player on a dime with its hair-trigger Afflictions and ferocious enemies. I asked Chris if he thinks Darkest Dungeon is balanced – i.e. fair to the player – and I really shouldn’t have been surprised by his response:‘Darkest Dungeon has never purported to be fair.  In fact, we go out of our way to tell players that they can expect bad strings of luck, unfortunate events, and general disaster around every corner.  Things are also not always in your control as a player – the game is built on the idea of making meaningful choices with permanent consequences, often with limited or imperfect information.  Darkest Dungeon is how you cope with the unexpected and the unfortunate, and as such, it can never really be ‘balanced’ in the conventional sense of the word.  You will lose a hero or two or five to bad dice rolls, the same way even the most experienced mountain climber can slip and break his leg.  The real question is: how do you deal with it?’The real stars of the show are the poor, tormented Heroes that make up your dungeon-scouring teams. Fresh and eager, they arrive seeking their fortunes – and almost uniformly end up dead, or far worse. Any long-lasting hero owes their success to intense therapy, prayer, drinking, strategy on the player’s part, and lots of luck.I asked Chris about the process of creating a new character class.‘It’s been a little different each time we go to bat.  Most of the time, we’ll first explore what we feel is fertile creative ground, always looking to sidestep mainstream RPG classes, or at least put our spin on them. Leading with the creative has served us well, and often sparks interesting game design discussions.  As the game has matured, however, mechanical opportunities have presented themselves, and we’ve developed outward from that – pairing a hero’s underlying skill mechanics with a strong thematic direction.  In the end, we’re looking for a strong visual, creative and mechanical identity for each of our heroes.  We want them to feel different from one other, and be memorable enough to stand out in a crowd.’Regarding unique characters, Darkest Dungeon has them in spades. While ‘normal’ RPGs tend toward the standard knight, rogue, healer, mage combo, Darkest Dungeon sports Heroes such as the Leper, the Abomination, and the Grave Robber. Over time, you’ll come to love your twisted little party as bad roll after bad roll inflicts them with disease and crippling mental trauma – until, eventually, they are too great a liability to keep around, good for nothing more than suicidal supply runs.It’s refreshing when a game offers a thematic style of play that is – wait for it – a natural result of the game’s systems. You aren’t told to treat new or useless characters like disposable drones to fuel your main party’s later expeditions, but as you learn of Darkest Dungeon’s cruel, merciless nature, you become cruel and merciless.Despite this, a lot of people complain about games that are ‘too difficult’ – Darkest Dungeon, in particular, has received some flak for its random nature, but that’s the point. The game isn’t about constructing an unbeatable team that can crush dungeons with ease, but just barely sustaining yourself against tides of bad luck and character deaths. I think there’s a lot to be said about generic assumptions stopping people from enjoying great games, but instead, I’ll let Chris explain why Darkest Dungeon needs to be punishing.‘It feels good to succeed when the odds are stacked against you!  From the outset, Darkest Dungeon has always been about subverting the power fantasy that exists in many RPGs.  When the game itself is the player’s chief antagonist, beating it can feel incredible.  The lower the lows, the higher the highs – and the more memorable the experience!’I finished by asking Chris for any hints about the future. What is Red Hook doing now? Is a Darkest Dungeon 2 on the horizon?‘We’ve just shipped a smaller DLC – “The Shieldbreaker” – which introduces a new hero to the roster.  Most of our team is now focused on a new, somewhat larger DLC, while a couple of us have started to break ground on our next game.  No details to share just yet, but it’s an exciting time at Red Hook!’Darkest Dungeon is available on Steam, PS4, PS Vita, and the Nintendo Switch.CALENDAR SUBSCRIBE:\nRSS iCalHEAVY is an independent online and print publication for heavy music, movies and related culture. The HEAVY Team are passionate about music and work hard to bring you the latest news, reviews and interviews every day.Thank you for your support.

      "This week, Red Hook Studios released the latest expansion to Darkest Dungeon, formally known as The Crimson Court. With this new DLC, we wanted to take a chance to catch up with Chris Bourassa and Tyler Sigman, the two leads behind the game, to see what they’ve learned about game development now that they’ve shipped a whole new update for their Kickstarter/Early Access success.The answer, as it turns out, is a whole lot. While our conversation (which you can watch in full up above) ranged from everything to designing The Crimson Court to the original design goals of Darkest Dungeon, you may want to know these key facts that came from our conversation with Bourassa and Signam.Making a game about stress helped Sigman and Bourassa understand how stress affected their livesAs they put it, the in-game character barks that drive up the stress level with other party members is actually a mechanic that Sigman and Bourassa saw reflected among their game development team in production. According to them, they wound up putting a moratorium on discussing stress as the project went on, instead electing to create a Slack icon based on the game’s stress icon to let other employees know when their mood wasn’t 100 percent.The game’s new character, the Flagellant, makes interesting use of the game’s death mechanicSince we figured we have some RPG designers in the audience looking for interesting character ideas, we delved into the design goals behind the Flagellant, the new class of character introduced in The Crimson Court. Sigman in particular took time to explain how this brawler, inspired by self-flagellating Spanish monks, is meant to encourage players to bring him closer toward death instead of avoiding it, and why it proved worthwhile with players.How Red Hook Studios planned to sell a $10 DLC \"with $15 worth of content\"Since most expansion packs are generally aimed at high-level, high skill players, it was unusual to see Red Hook Studios sell a separate campaign expansion that integrated with the core of the game, as opposed to appending itself at the end. Sigman and Bourassa explained their general intent behind “going back to the well” and why they think it’s a decent model for single-player DLC.If this was useful insight for you, be sure to follow the Gamasutra Twitch channel for more developer interviews, editor roundtables and gameplay commentary.",
      "When the going gets tough, the Crusader gets off, wildly swinging his broadsword in masochistic glee. Another member of the party is suddenly gripped with existential dread and is frozen with fear. The healer does her best until she falls victim, forever, to a combination of hysteria and slow-acting poison, and the mage casts her magic, but she’s in a poor position and falls victim to a barrage of arrows and a fear-indiced heart attack . And this ragtag quartet has only reached the third room of the dungeon. Now in final release after over a year in Early Access, Darkest Dungeon might just be one of the simplest yet simultaneously nuanced games you’ll play. Kudos to Red Hook Studios for layering their game with subtlety and depth in a way that isn’t opaque or confusing, instead being a great lesson on how to balance accessibility and complexity.Darkest Dungeon is a roguelike, heavily invested in what have become the fundamental tenets of the genre: character permadeath and procedurally generated levels that are just as likely to present a major foe in the second room as the twentieth. If you’re wary of the genre, at least take heart that in Darkest Dungeon, the combat is thoughtful and turn-based and there is some chance that careful preparation and savvy character management will see you through.First impressions are important, and thanks to its excellent voice over narration, evocative music, and dark, 2D gothic graphic novel art style Darkest Dungeon makes a great one, intriguing and grabbing the new player immediately. While the story is paper thin, it’s narrated with appropriate gravitas throughout, and that includes the ongoing narrative “color commentary” during the battles. After starting the game, it’s only a matter of moments before your four-member party is plunged into a dungeon crawl.Turn-based enemy encounters are the main course in Darkest Dungeon, and they are in one sense, totally as expected, with each character electing to use his or her turn to fight, heal, or use healing or buffing items on themselves or the party. There are over 14 different classes of heroes and naturally they have unique skills and abilities to bring to the fight. Positioning in the lineup during combat is incredibly important and sometimes characters will relocate to the back of the party on their own to heal or be sheltered, or out of cowardice. Or, they might rush forward in a show of unwise bravado.Darkest Dungeon calls the changing psychological states of the characters the Affliction System, based on the premise — and really, this is the biggest hook of the game — that the stress of exploring will impact the mental and emotional health of characters in many different ways. Some will see their comrades fall and be disheartened, while others will be inspired to fight harder. Some will call on God for help, and some will have a crisis of faith and lose the will to live. Some characters are masochists and love the pain of their wounds, other will be so frightened that they have a heart attack and die.To some small extent, the player can mitigate the influence of these emotional states through spells, potions, and healing items, but a more effective strategy is taking a balanced group into battle. The party is assembled in town out of an ever-expanding roster of characters who arrive at the tavern on the stagecoach. After a few rounds, all the town’s healing and crafting opportunities are available. You can send the more zealous heros to heal at the church, or rest a more sexually deviant character at the town’s bordello. Each of the businesses can be extensively upgraded which in turn makes the heroes that much stronger and more capable. Like in X-Com, one becomes attached to heroes and tries hard to hold onto the most skilled ones, but there will come a time when they are lost in battle forever. Death in Darkest Dungeon is permanent.The dungeons — each linked to a chapter of the game’s story — themselves are represented on the minimap as straight hallways and rooms, and each dungeon has several stages. Exploring each section of the dungeon reveals not only a plethora of enemy encounters but traps, chests, piles of books, and progress-blocking rubble. Sometimes an innocuous stack of dusty volumes will strike a member of the party with terror when the books are read. Having an adequate supply of consumables is critical. Shovels clear rubble out of the way, bandages can be used during battle, and of course, heroes have to eat to maintain their strength.Closing Comments:Darkest Dungeon is difficult, but not because its systems are unclear or unfair. In fact, the richness and complexity of its mechanics are miraculously transparent. What makes Darkest Dungeon challenging is balancing and equipping a party and the essentially unpredictable nature of the dungeons and combat. The art style — hand-drawn and evocative, with just enough effective animation to keep things interesting without adding overwhelm to the already busy nature of the action — is beautiful, and its music and stentorian narration are perfectly in sync with the characters. The whole enterprise is polished and a lot of fun.Version Reviewed: PC",

      "By\nIan Birnbaum\n2016-01-20T10:24:28.19ZReviewA wonderfully executed, brilliantly stressful reinvention of party-based dungeon-crawling, Darkest Dungeon is great fun, even when its cruel.The first one to lose his mind is the plague doctor. His crow-faced mask wobbles as his sanity snaps, and he starts to pour abuse on his comrades. As the party fights unholy monsters in the crypts beneath a swamp, the chaos and his shouting break the rest. An armored paladin falls dead from a heart attack. Another chokes on a cloud of spores thrown by a monstrous, sentient fungus. The mad plague doctor runs alone out of the dark. He’s sent to the sanitarium. Like all veterans of bloody conflict, he’ll never be the person he was before.In Darkest Dungeon, this disaster is known as “Week 3.” Every week goes about as well. Dungeon diving and tomb raiding have been staples of PC gaming for decades, but Darkest Dungeon is the first time I felt how awful this quest must be for the people involved. In Darkest Dungeon, explorers don’t just have to bandage their wounds and sharpen their axes—their biggest vulnerability is their minds.After getting bored drinking and fornicating his way through the family fortune, your dear father decided to investigate rumors of wondrous magic buried deep beneath the ancestral home. But he and his workmen dug too greedily and awoke an ancient evil, sending the countryside into ruin. Just before he sends a musket ball through his brain, dear old dad sends you a letter: come home, rebuild the local village, and defeat the evil. Bang. Splat.Once the road to town is reopened, you recruit heroes and send them into the dungeons four at a time. When (if) they return, they are damaged, stressed out, and hopefully a bit richer. While in town they can drink, gamble, pray—whatever they need to get their heads sorted out so they can walk back into the long dark. One half of Darkest Dungeon is managing this growing town, opening and upgrading blacksmith shops and taverns to give your heroes an edge in the fight.The other half is the real meat and potatoes: leading sidescrolling parties of four heroes in turn-based combat against otherworldly horrors. Entering a dungeon brings up a map showing a simple floorplan: a few rooms connected by hallways. There’s no need to explore, and most levels ask you to explore the entire level anyway. The map’s real purpose is to show you how much of the level remains. If things are going poorly and you still have half a dozen rooms to clear, it’s probably time to wave the white flag and get out.When your party of maniacs runs up against a squad of horrors, a short, turn-based battle starts. Combatants take turns using abilities to attack, heal, or cast spells. Especially at the beginning of the game, I found the few characters and abilities available made these battles more of a slog. Combat gets more fun as more character types arrive in town and new abilities get unlocked. Battles are always tense, though, and I found myself dreading them as expeditions grew longer and more dangerous.It’s hard enough keeping everyone alive, but battles put adventurers under a lot of stress, too. Seeing a friend die or barely surviving a critical attack has a tendency to make people freak out. When characters crack, they take on random debilitating traits like “abusive” or “afraid.” This is the well-executed balancing act of Darkest Dungeon: I love trying to keep people healthy and sane. It’s easy to do one or the other, but that’s not enough. Your heroes can die just as easily from a heart attack as from a sword.I also enjoyed tinkering with character classes in different party positions. The order of the heroes is important, with heavily armored tanks taking the front spot and spell-casters, archers, and healers holding in the back. Most melee attacks can only be aimed at the front ranks, and some spells can only be cast from the middle of a group. The most interesting classes are those in the middle. I enjoyed experimenting with characters who could fight in a melee role from one spot, but a support role from another.During one of my early expeditions, I had poured through character sheets to find the perfect set of four heroes and assigned them in the perfect order. In the team’s first battle, an enemy summoner opened a portal to hell. A massive tentacle reached through it and grabbed my healer, shoving her to the front of the party and flipping my careful plan right on its ass. Darkest Dungeon’s greatest delight is finding new ways to screw you.Calling Darkest Dungeon merely “Lovecraftian” is a disservice to the mythology developer Red Hook has built here. (It’s also an undue compliment to H. P. Lovecraft’s one-note writing.) Both the heroes (occultists, Amazonians, thieves, paladins, plague doctors, lepers, bounty hunters, rogues) and the enemies (skeletons, zombies, ghosts, enthralled souls, fish-people, mushroom-monsters, spiders, maggots) draw from a huge sampling of source material, and I love its unexpected variety.Darkest Dungeon is exceptional for how carefully-built and deliberate all its parts are. Every sound effect, every splash of color, and every character and ability all work to create an environment inspired by low fantasy novels and pulpy weird-horror magazines. When the Vestal, an acolyte of a Roman goddess of purifying fire, became racked with fear, she would cry out for her god’s protection in the darkness. When the hound master lost his mind to stress, he became bitter and withdrawn, commenting that his bumbling companions lacked proper training. I love that Darkest Dungeon takes inspiration from so many sources, yet uses all of those pieces to create character classes that serve a clever, foreboding fiction.There’s an important distinction, though, between the character classes and the individuals. The classes are interesting and unique, but the individuals are just meat for the grinder. The worst thing about Darkest Dungeon is coming to grips with the idea that there can be no perfection. As a habitual save-scummer, this was hard for me. The auto-save feature is always on, so every mistake, every critical hit or critical miss, is permanent. Every death is permadeath.This can be especially frustrating in early missions, when the slow trickle of heroes and their low-level abilities don’t always give you the tools you need to handle the pain coming your way. After an easy first mission, I consistently lost people, abandoned missions, or wrote off entire expeditions in the early weeks. During one very frustrating expedition, my healer kept everyone in tip-top health, but I had no way to manage stress. The mission ended in disgrace when four completely able-bodied adventurers died in an unprecedented quadruple heart attack. I’ve played a lot of permadeath strategy games, but I’ve never experienced a squad wipe due to acute mental distress before.One of the reasons I love Darkest Dungeon is that measuring the mental toll of adventuring feels so overdue. Game violence has been consequence-free for a long time, but that’s changing. The new Tomb Raider games show Lara Croft dealing with profound mental trauma, for example, and games like Viscera Cleanup Detail poke at shooters’ carefree bodycount.Maybe it’s even part of a growing cultural awareness of the cost of violence. With thousands of new veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, PTSD has become a household word. I think it’s fine to avoid the complex topic in a videogame, but walking into the subject directly is gripping where an artful evasion is the norm. This isn’t to say that Darkest Dungeon makes any kind of statement about veteran care or the cost of real war, but I do think these themes are engaging. Battling demons in a dungeon would really mess people up, and that’s not often acknowledged through game design in such a pronounced way.The more I played, the more I grew detached from the heroes in my roster. I even refused to rename or invest in the veterans of multiple tours—exactly the opposite of my squads in XCOM, which were all customized and named for family and friends. Becoming attached would make it more stressful to send them on another ill-conceived quest for trinkets and coin, and even more disappointing when they came back broken and despondent. When the cost is measured in sanity and blood, the most powerful lesson Darkest Dungeon taught me about adventuring is that it isn’t always worth doing.What is it?

      "Front page layoutSite themeDarkest Dungeon's first-ever DLC, The Crimson Court, is going to be a hard sell for many players. That's not just a pun on the expansion's extreme difficulty, either, although there is plenty of that here.For those new to the game—and perhaps looking at The Crimson Court as an excuse to hop aboard the crazy train—Darkest Dungeon is a brutal turn-based dungeon crawler. In-game time passes when you send bedraggled squads into the depths of different dungeons. Managing time, resources, and a revolving door of adventurers is a delicate balance that players either learn to walk or bow out of altogether.The Crimson Court DLC isn't self-contained, which presents the expansion's first structural hurdle. You either need to start a new campaign or use an existing save where you don't mind turning that balance inside out with new enemies, objectives, and dangers.That was a pretty tall request for me. I've got a friend or two who have been more than happy to play Darkest Dungeon to completion multiple times since it left Early Access in 2016. I'm not like them. I was plenty happy to beat the grueling game once and walk away. So when I learned that The Crimson Court's addition was more extension than expansion, I was worried I wouldn't be able work up the nerve to commit to the game again from scratch.Maybe I'm more like my friends than I thought. Either that, or the new, vampire-centric Crimson Court is just that tantalizing. Probably both.That's not to say Crimson Court is inviting. The expansion’s new horror begins on week five of a regular Darkest Dungeon campaign, at which point the Hamlet—your home-away-from-horror—is beset by mosquitoes. These literal and figurative buggers put a dent in how much stress your returning spelunkers regain in-town each week. In a game where too much stress can cause your party members to go off the deep end, that's a very frustrating development.The solution is to enter the aptly named Courtyard to burn out the mosquito nests therein. This new zone comprises the bulk of new content specific to The Crimson Court. Of course, you'll want to dive in right away: both to reduce the strain on your employees and to see the new stuff. I recommend waiting, however. Once you pop the seal on the Courtyard, new and potentially devastating enemies start springing up in each and every one of the game's randomly generated levels.That wouldn't be a huge problem, but these new tick- and mosquito-inspired foes can infect your party members with the so-called Crimson Curse. You'll end up spending a lot of time and energy managing the Crimson Curse, a change that fundamentally alters how you think about Darkest Dungeon.The curse is mostly bad. It lowers a given dungeoneer's resistance to just about every negative status effect, reduces their maximum hit points, and increases the chance that they'll go batty when stress gets too high. If that weren't enough, the curse gets worse and worse over time, until the infected adventurer croaks completely. And cursed allies also have a chance of infecting their companions back at the Hamlet.You can only mitigate the curse with the proper application of The Blood, a new resource that drops randomly from enemies. This actually buffs your cursed units for a time. Unfortunately, it also adds a random chance that they might freak out and perform negative actions, much as they would if they'd had a stress breakdown.Mercifully, you can cure the curse. But early in the campaign, curing is only possible by completing missions inside the Courtyard... which requires another random enemy-dropped resource called Invitations.Crimson Court's new enemies, zone, bosses, and hero class (a cross-breed support class and frontliner called the Flagellant, focused on making enemies bleed) are an enormous breath of fresh air. Darkest Dungeon gets plenty of (somewhat deserved) guff for overtaxing its same few areas to support a very long game. The Crimson Court almost sabotages its best feature—more space to play in and around—by stretching out its running time through a reliance on forced loot drops. Basically, a very grindy game got bigger to make the grind less noticeable, but it added more and different grinds on top.I'm conflicted. I have a pretty high tolerance for grinding in games, which goes as far as appreciation in the right circumstances. Vanilla Darkest Dungeon met those circumstances better than nearly any game I've ever played. So much of the game is about taking risks in the short-term and mitigating those risks in the long-term with better gear, soldiers, upgrades, and knowledge. The Crimson Court plays into that risk/reward structure perfectly.But even if the game needs a bit of grinding to work—for those scads of disposable units to turn into a few shining diamonds—the grind itself shouldn't be totally random. Far from it. Darkest Dungeon succeeds largely because, at any given point, you know what kind of danger you're throwing your resources into and what kind of rewards await. Missions warn you in advance how long and difficult they'll be, what kinds of enemies you'll face, and whether or not a boss is waiting for you at the end.Crimson Court's totally random drops on necessary items, like The Blood and Invitations needed to enter the Courtyard, slightly throw off the balance between firmness and fairness.Thankfully, the developers at Red Hook have proven themselves extremely amenable to rebalancing. In fact, The Crimson Court dropped alongside a massive update that changed many existing heroes, added entirely new building mechanics in the Hamlet, and just generally rejiggered the whole experience. Since its release, Red Hook has already bumped up drop rates on The Blood multiple times.Darkest Dungeon has never been a stranger to change. I'm confident that with enough time and tweaking, Red Hook will get its reconfigured concoction just right again. In the meantime, though, The Crimson Court is still a gruesome, enticing infusion for the game. It was enough to rope me back into the madness after I thought I was home free. And I'm very excited to see what comes next.Randomness keeps Darkest Dungeon's signature grind in a holding pattern, but new content breathes life into the whole experience.

    "title": "Enter the Gungeon",
    "text": [
      "Enter the Gungeon is a bullet hell roguelike video game developed by Dodge Roll and published by Devolver Digital. It follows four adventurers as they descend into the Gungeon to find a gun to kill their past. The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 4 on April 5, 2016, on Xbox One on April 5, 2017, as well as on Nintendo Switch on December 14, 2017.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nEnter the Gungeon is a fast-paced bullet hell shooter with roguelike elements, and is therefore often compared to The Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne. The player chooses between the four protagonists, all of whom have different special abilities, such as calling for support or lockpicking chests. A second player is able to join in for co-op mode and control a fifth character. While the player descends the Gungeon, they are set to go through multiple floors, each with a random number of rooms in it. While the rooms are pre-defined, the constellation of rooms in a floor, the enemies that appear in the rooms, and treasure are procedurally generated. Each room contains a set of enemies, which vary in strength, endurance, and attack behaviour, where the attack can range from simple, straightforward shots to a complicated mixture of shots fired at the same time. The player may dodge attacks by performing a dodge roll, which was inspired by the Souls series of video games, and are invulnerable during the action, or alternatively flip tables and use them as covers, although tables can be destroyed if they are shot at. The player has a limited number of \"blanks\" for each floor that can be used to eliminate all current projectiles and temporarily stun enemies. To defeat enemies, the player must use guns, which can be found in chests, won by defeating bosses, or bought at shops scattered around the floors in the Gungeon. The game features over 300 different guns and items that can be combined to achieve more powerful effects. At the end of each floor, a boss awaits the player; beating the boss grants the player a gun or item and currency to spend at shops and unlocks the next floor.As the player progresses through multiple playthroughs, they may encounter non-player characters that can be rescued from the Gungeon. Once rescued, these characters take residence at the Breach, a safe level above the Gungeon, and where the player, prior to starting a new playthrough, can spend a type of in-game currency earned from boss fights to permanently unlock special items that will then have a chance of appearing within the Gungeon for all subsequent playthroughs.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nEnter the Gungeon is set on a distant planet inhabited by living bullets and other strange lifeforms. A gun that could kill the past itself was kept deep within a grim fortress, until a deadly force tore the fortress down and reduced it to ashes. The fortress was rebuilt with the highest of security measures and six adventurers, each with their own stories and regrets, decide to enter the fortress and descend into the Gungeon to seek the legendary gun in order to defeat their own past.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDevelopment on Enter the Gungeon started in 2014, with four Mythic Entertainment employees leaving the company to fulfil their own project just before the company would shut down later that year. According to developer Dave Crooks, he had been listening to the soundtrack to the game Gun Godz by Vlambeer, and the name \"gungeon\" came to him the next day. Crooks presented the name Enter the Gungeon to his fellow team members, and they fleshed out the game's lore over a lunch meeting and then spent the next few weeks to prototype the game mechanics. Though Crooks stated that The Binding of Isaac was one of the game's biggest influences, they also were influenced by Nuclear Throne, Spelunky, Dark Souls and Metal Gear Solid.Dungeons in the game are generated in a procedural manner, but they found it was better to handcraft the individual rooms, playtesting those individually, and then using their random generation to connect these rooms into a dungeon. The designs of the guns took place over the two years of development, with most of the designs by team artist Joe Harty; several of the guns are inspired by other video games and video game systems, including the NES Zapper and guns similar to those appearing in games such as Mega Man, Metroid, Shadow Warrior and Serious Sam. The boss character designs were made by a combination of ideas from Crooks and Harty, which then fed into the gameplay programmer David Rubel to determine appropriate bullet hell patterns associated with that idea.The dodge roll mechanic was inspired by trying to include a similar mechanic of Ikaruga that enabled a player to easily dodge numerous bullets simultaneously, and took the ideas used in the Dark Souls series to have the character dodge out of the way. The team loved this mechanic so much that they opted to name their studio after it. Similarly, they included usable environmental features such as flipping tables or bringing chandeliers down onto enemies to encourage the player to interact with and use the environment to their own advantage. At one point they had included an active reload feature, similar to Gears of War in which pressing a controller button at the right time during a reload would increase the damage the reloaded bullets would do, but instead decided to limit this to a power-up that can be collected, finding that players were already distracted enough by everything else going on in the game and that felt the moment of tension when the player had to wait for the gun to reload was critical to gameplay.Dodge Roll eventually signed a contract with Devolver Digital. In December 2014, at PlayStation Experience, the game was officially announced and followed by an announcement trailer. Throughout 2015, the game went to multiple conventions, including E3 2015, where, during the PC Gaming Show, the co-op feature of the game was revealed. On March 2, 2016, it was announced that the game will release on April 5, 2016. The game is set to receive free post-release content, such as more weapons, enemies, and levels. The first of these, the \"Supply Drop\" update, which adds several new guns, enemies, and room layouts, was released for free on January 26, 2017.A port to the Xbox One, including cross-buy and cross-play support for Windows 10, was released a year later on April 5, 2017; it includes the \"Supply Drop\" expansion. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released in North America and Europe on December 14 and 18, 2017 respectively.A second major update, \"Advanced Gungeons & Draguns\", was released on July 19, 2018 for all platforms, which among additional weapons and enemies, was aimed to provide means to play the game that are friendlier to inexperienced players, but still offer more challenge for others.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nUpon release, Enter the Gungeon received mostly positive reviews, and holds a Metacritic score of 84/100 for PC and one of 82/100 for PlayStation 4. Jed Whitaker of Destructoid rated the game 9.5/10, with praise that the repetitive entering of Gungeon \"never quite feels all that repetitious\", however stating that \"[t]he only part of Gungeon that will surely turn off some people is the difficulty.\" Electronic Gaming Monthly's Spencer Campbell summarizes the game as \"overwhelming\", giving it a score of 9.0/10, however, also decries the difficulty to be too high by saying \"Even though there were a few times that I yearned [] for an easier difficulty [...], Enter the Gungeon's difficulty is actually one of the game's strong points.\" Vince Ingenito from IGN regards the large variety of guns in the game to be especially pleasing, but stating that a few guns are not very original or plain boring, rating the game 8.5/10. For Hardcore Gamer, Kyle LeClair gave Enter the Gungeon a score of 4.5/5, highlighting the game's \"terrific sense of humor, astonishing action, and style and charm oozing out of every corner of its pixelated world\", naming it to be \"[a]n absolute blast at every turn and just pure concentrated fun overall\". The Escapist's Joshua Vanderwall gave the game 3.5/5 stars, criticizing that \"the difficulty often comes from the game refusing to provide you the necessary tools\", also stating that \"[t]he learning curve is very reasonable at first, but there are regular spikes that less proficient players will find incredibly frustrating\".Enter the Gungeon sold more than 200,000 copies within its first week across all platforms, with Steam Spy suggesting that about 75% of these sales were made on Steam. By January 2017, the game has sold more than 800,000 units on all platforms, according to Devolver Digital,\nand reached over one million sales by July 2017.Enter the Gungeon was a financial success on the Switch selling over 75,000 copies in just two weeks and many more to follow after that.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

      "Dave Crooks talks about the foundation of Dodge Roll Games, the creation of Enter the Gungeon, and what their plans are for the game’s future. We also talked about the “Indiepocalypse.”Ian Miles Cheong /\nFeatures /\nDave Crooks, Enter the Gungeon, Interviews, PC, PS4 /Enter the Gungeon is out, and yes, it’s great. The recently released game marries roguelikes and bullet hell mechanics with a charming pixel art aesthetic that’s captured dozens of hours of my time. The game sold more than 200,000 copies in its first three days of release and is by all accounts a bonafide success, allowing the developers to create more content for the game and develop future titles. Dodge Roll Games revealed that the game turned a profit just 8 hours after going live.So I couldn’t turn down the opportunity to interview one of its creators, Dave Crooks, founder and producer at Dodge Roll. We talked about the game at length, how the studio founded and what their plans are for its future. We also talked about the so-called “indiepocalypse,” and how it doesn’t actually exist.Please introduce yourself to our fine readers and tell us a bit about what you do at Dodge Roll Games.Every project requires team work to be accomplished, and by the first impressions of the game, you appear to have found a lot of talent in your studio. Would you mind telling us about the members of your team?You’ve mentioned that most of Dodge Roll Games comes from Mythic. Would you mind going over some of the games your team has created and how their experience played into the development of Enter the Gungeon?Enter the Gungeon is a new take on the dungeon crawler genre, but it feels reminiscent of popular titles like Binding of Isaac. What other titles did your studio draw inspiration from?Every great game needs to have two things: An intriguing story and good game mechanics. You’ve mentioned that Enter the Gungeon’s story is based on Dan Simmons’ Hyperion. As the game is clearly more than just a dungeon crawler, how does the “Gun that can kill the past” play into the characters’ backgrounds? What kind of details can we expect to learn about the four playable characters?Your team has finished the main body of work for Enter the Gungeon, but I understand that you are committed to improving the game constantly to make the experience better. What type of add-ons can we expect to see?Throughout my time with Enter the Gungeon I find myself constantly using the dodge function. How vital do you believe this mechanic is to the player’s survival? And are there other mechanics we can expect to see added to the game?Many dungeon crawlers tend to be single-player adventures. What made Dodge Roll Games create a co-op “bullet-hell” dungeon experience? Do you have any plans to add online co-op?With the time your team has spent developing this game, what would you say was the greatest appeal that Enter the Gungeon has for drawing in new gamers?What would you say was the greatest challenge for you and your team with developing Enter the Gungeon?The “Indiepocalypse” has become something of a hot topic. (For our readers, the “Indiepocalypse” refers to the extinction, or at least diminishing popularity of indie games) What’s your take on the successes and failures of games within the scene? Are some developers just not making games most gamers want to play?What do you think of the Let’s Play scene? How big of an impact do you think streamers and LPs on YouTube have towards the success (or failure) of new, especially indie games?Do you have any words of wisdom for any people out there that wish to become game developers in the future?Thank you for giving us time to interview you and learning more about your studio’s project. What closing thoughts would you wish to leave our readers with?↑",

      "By\nJake Tucker\n2016-04-08T15:56:41.98ZReviewEnter the Gungeon is a good shooter that underdelivers on its promise. It's still fun, but there are better examples of the genre.Enter The Gungeon has a gun fetish. The story revolves around a giant bullet and a gun that can kill the past. Enemies are mostly bullets, the end-of-level lift is a shell casing, the in-game art modelled around gun paraphernalia, Even the health bar models its hearts on bullets.Enter The Gungeon is the latest in a long line of top-down roguelike shooters. It takes its inspiration from genre standouts Nuclear Throne and Binding of Isaac, but also adds many other cool touches to make something that’s a blast to play, even if it doesn’t quite match the highs of its peers.From Binding of Isaac, it borrows the chaotic room-based structure, and the ridiculous boss battle blocking your path to the floors below. From Nuclear Throne, the mass of guns and power-ups, the ridiculous weapons and host of weird and wonderful enemies.It’s one of the hardest top-down shooters I’ve played in a long time. Enemies in the first room are capable of spewing endless rounds your way, and even on the first floor death can come quickly if you get overwhelmed. There's also the bosses which, to a man, are the hardest things I've ever encountered.Gungeon's additions all feel meaningful. Every character has a dodge roll, making you invulnerable to harm while you’re in the air and allowing you to dance between incoming rounds. You can also kick barrels at enemies and flip tables to shield yourself from upcoming fire, allowing you to make yourself a spot of cover in the middle of a shootout.The floors of the dungeon – sorry, gungeon – are a series of hand crafted rooms, meaning you start to recognise slight similarities. It means you can have strategies for certain rooms, and none of the encounters feel truly unfair, even if you might feel like some of your deaths are a bit cheesy.One of the best things about the game is that combat is filled with decisions. Reloading, flipping tables, rolling across the floor. All of these are essential to the flow of combat, and how you use them will determine how successful you are. Many of the weapons also have secondary effects or function that you’ll have to factor into your strategies. One gun gets less powerful as the clip drains, while another alternates between spewing fuel and fire.The real complaint about the game is that, for all of the wonderful guns, power-ups and flow of combat, actually pulling the trigger on most of the guns feels flat. It's disappointing. For a top-down shooter, the fact that shooting feels a bit dull is a big problem, and it’s testament to how good the game feels everywhere else that I’ve enjoyed it regardless.There are four starting characters to choose from, and each has their own strengths. They're not all that different in playstyle, merely starting out with different sets of weapons and passive items, but one of them has a dog, and so became my go-to. Each of these characters has their own reasons for wanting to find the gun that can kill the past, although the narrative isn't terribly important beyond justifying why a bunch of sentient bullets want to murder you.There’s a lot to learn, and most of your information is going to come from within the Ammonomicon, a book which will give you information on everything you’re currently packing, in addition to anything you’ve discovered before. This is good because when you’re picking up weapons like a beehive, a camera or just a bit of tree, it’s invaluable to be able to work out how you’re going to kill folk with it.Over time, when returning to the Breach, you’ll notice it’s slowly evolving as your adventurers fight through the gungeon. Certain characters you find in the depths will return to the Breach and start to offer a variety of services. This gives Gungeon a light metagame to encourage repeated playthroughs, but finding all of the bizarre weaponry is very much its own reward.The loot is so bizarre that it’s a shame how tight-fisted the game is at handing it out. You’ll find new items and power-ups rarely, with a couple of chests per floor, a shop and the boss being the only real way to get the weapons and ammo. Frequently you’ll find yourself stuck with your starter weapons and several times I’ve had to plink at bosses with the starter pistol. Considering a good weapon is the only way to succeed, it can be infuriating.I like Enter the Gungeon a lot, despite it’s numerous little niggles. There’s a lot of depth here for fans of the genre, and importantly, it's a lot of fun. You'll die a bunch, you'll probably rage at a fair few deaths, but you'll keep coming back for more.What is it? A top-down shooter roguelike with a shedload of guns.Expect to pay: $15/£10Developer: Dodge Roll GamesPublisher: Devolver DigitalReviewed on: Intel i5, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 970Multiplayer: Local co-opEnter the Gungeon is a good shooter that underdelivers on its promise.

      "Click on below button to start Enter the Gungeon Download Free PC Game. It is a Full Version PC Game. Just download torrent and start playing it.Enter the Gungeon Download Free Full Game is a bullet hell roguelike video game developed by Dodge Roll and published by Devolver Digital. It follows four adventurers as they descend into the Gungeon to find a gun to kill their past. The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 4 on April 5, 2016.GameplayEnter the Gungeon is a fast-paced bullet hell shooter with roguelike elements, and is therefore often compared to The Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne. The player chooses between the four protagonists, all who have different special abilities, such as calling for support or lockpicking chests. A second player is able to join in for co-op mode and control a fifth character. While the player descends the Gungeon, they are set to go through multiple floors, each with a random number of rooms in it. While the rooms are pre-defined, the constellation of rooms in a floor is procedurally generated. Each room contains a set of enemies, which vary in strength, endurance, and attack behaviour, where the attack can range from simple, straightforward shots to a complicated mixture of shots fired at the same time. Enter the Gungeon Free Download.The player may dodge attacks by performing a dodge roll, which was inspired by the Souls series of video games, and are invulnerable during the action, or alternatively flip tables and use them as covers, although tables can be destroyed if they are shot at. The player has a limited number of «blanks» for each floor that can be used to eliminate all current projectiles and temporarily stun enemies. To defeat enemies, the player must use guns, which can be found in chests, won by defeating bosses, or bought at shops scattered around the floors in the Gungeon. The game features over 200 different guns and items that can be combined to achieve more powerful effects. At the end of each floor, a boss awaits the player; beating the boss grants the player currency to spend at shops and unlocks the next floor.As the player progresses through multiple playthroughs, they may encounter non-player characters that can be rescued from the Gungeon. Once rescued, these characters take residence at the Breach, a safe level above the Gungeon, and where the player, prior to starting a new playthrough, can spend a type of in-game currency earned from boss fights to permanently unlock special items that will then have a chance of appearing within the Gungeon for all subsequent playthroughs.PlotEnter the Gungeon is set on a distant planet inhabited by living bullets and other strange lifeforms. A gun that could kill the past itself was kept deep within a grim fortress, until a deadly force tore the fortress down and brought it to ashes. The fortress was rebuilt with the highest of security measures and four adventurers, each with their own stories and regrets, decide to enter the fortress and descend into the Gungeon to seek the legendary gun in order to defeat their own past. Enter the Gungeon Free Download PC Game.DevelopmentDevelopment on Enter the Gungeon started in 2014, with four Mythic Entertainment employees leaving the company to fullfil their own project just before the company would shut down later that year. According to developer Dave Crooks, he had been listening to the soundtrack to the game Gun Godz by Vlambeer, and the name «gungeon» came to him the next day. Crooks presented the name Enter the Gungeon to his fellow team members, and they fleshed out the game's lore over a lunch meeting and then spent the next few weeks to prototype the game mechanics. Though Crooks stated that The Binding of Isaac was one of the game's biggest influences, they also were influenced by Nuclear Throne, Spelunky, Dark Souls and Metal Gear Solid.Dungeons in the game are generated in a procedural manner, but they found it was better to handcraft the individual rooms, playtesting those individually, and then using their random generation to connect these rooms into a dungeon. The designs of the guns took place over the two years of development, with most of the designs by team artist Joe Harty; several of the guns are inspired by other video games and video game systems, including the NES Zapper and guns similar to those appearing in games such as Mega Man, Metroid, Shadow Warrior and Serious Sam. The boss character designs were made by a combination of ideas from Crooks and Harty, which then fed into the gameplay programmer David Rubel to determine appropriate bullet hell patterns associated with that idea. Enter the Gungeon for PC.The dodge roll mechanic was inspired by trying to include a similar mechanic of Ikaruga that enabled a player to easily dodge numerous bullets simultaneously, and took the ideas used in the Dark Souls series to have the character dodge out of the way. The team loved this mechanic so much that they opted to name their studio after it. Similarly, they included usable environmental features such as flipping tables or bringing chandeliers down onto enemies to encourage the player to interact with and use the environment to their own advantage. At one point they had included an active reload feature, similar to Gears of War in which pressing a controller button at the right time during a reload would increase the damage the reloaded bullets would do, but instead decided to limit this to a power-up that can be collected, finding that players were already distracted enough by everything else going on in the game and that felt the moment of tension when the player had to wait for the gun to reload was critical to gameplay.Dodge Roll eventually signed a contract with Devolver Digital. In December 2014, at PlayStation Experience, the game was officially announced and followed by an announcement trailer. Throughout 2015, the game went to multiple conventions, including E3 2015, where, during the PC Gaming Show, the co-op feature of the game was revealed. On March 2, 2016, it was announced that the game will release on April 5, 2016. The game is set to receive free post-release content, such as more weapons, enemies, and levels.ReceptionUpon release, Enter the Gungeon received mostly positive reviews, and holds a Metacritic score of 84/100 for PC and one of 82/100 for PlayStation 4. Jed Whitaker of Destructoid rated the game 9.5/10, with praise that the repetitive entering of Gungeon «never quite feels all that repetitious», however stating that [t]«he only part of Gungeon that will surely turn off some people is the difficulty.» Electronic Gaming Monthly's Spencer Campbell summarizes the game as «overwhelming», giving it a score of 9.0/10, however, also decries the difficulty to be too high by saying «Even though there were a few times that I yearned [] for an easier difficulty [...], Enter the Gungeon's difficulty is actually one of the game's strong points.» Vince Ingenito from IGN regards the large variety of guns in the game to be especially pleasing, but stating that a few guns are not very original or plain boring, rating the game 8.5/10. For Hardcore Gamer, Kyle LeClair gave Enter the Gungeon a score of 4.5/5, highlighting the game's «terrific sense of humor, astonishing action, and style and charm oozing out of every corner of its pixelated world», naming it to be [a]«n absolute blast at every turn and just pure concentrated fun overall». The Escapist's Joshua Vanderwall gave the game 3.5/5 stars, criticizing that «the difficulty often comes from the game refusing to provide you the necessary tools», also stating that [t]«he learning curve is very reasonable at first, but there are regular spikes that less proficient players will find incredibly frustrating».Enter the Gungeon sold more than 200,000 copies within its first week across all platforms, with Steam Spy suggesting that about 75% of these sales were made on Steam.

      "Mar\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t02Mar\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t02Posted by Dave Crooks Founder and Designer, Dodge RollEnter the Gungeon is done. Well, basically done. There is still work to do: bug fixing and balancing, and planning for updates — but we are at the end of the tunnel and our gunfight dungeon crawler will be available on PlayStation 4 on April 5. When I look at our game in its finished form, I feel incredibly proud of what our small team has been able to accomplish over the last two years. The game is so much bigger than our original vision, but it is also much better, more robust, and with more variety.We know that variety is king in a game like ours, so when coming up with ideas for guns, we did our best to eliminate the word “no” from the discussion. We’ve tried to pack the game with as much fun loot as we could.Enter the Gungeon will launch with 190 player-usable guns, ranging from pistols and rifles, to laser and beam weaponry, to much crazier weaponry as well. We have a gun that shoots sharks, a gun that shoots bees, a unicorn horn that shoots rainbows — there is a gun that can turn enemies into chickens, and another that might turn them into snakes. You can spread oil all over the floor with the Fossilized Gun, light it on fire using the Flare Gun, and put it out using the Water Gun, then freeze the water using the Freeze Ray.The loot you find in Enter the Gungeon isn’t just guns though, there are 200 items as well that can provide permanent buffs or temporary advantages. You might get the Shock Rounds that create an arc of electricity between the shots you fire, or the Heavy Bullets that make all of your bullets larger and slower, but more powerful. You might find a cardboard box to hide in and get the jump on enemies, or a roll of duct tape that binds two guns together.You’ll probably be very thankful for that extra firepower when dealing with the challenges the Gungeon will throw at you. It is you and your arsenal against 85 different breeds of enemies (plus mimics) and 20 murderous bosses. That includes a unique final boss for each of the four main characters that takes place in the past. Including co-op, there are 7 ways to “win” the game.Along the way you’ll run into Gungeoneers that came before you. If you rescue them, they may prove grateful and open up a shop, lend a hand deeper in the Gungeon, or challenge your skill for a prize. In most runs you’ll buy items from the local shopkeeper, but I’d warn against vandalism or stealing. There are more than 15 characters to find in the depths, and another five mysterious shrines to pray to, providing a variety of effects.When we started the game we thought to ourselves, “We’ll be done in a year for sure!” I can only laugh at our optimism, now that we are nearly two years into the project. I want to take a moment to thank Devolver Digital and the team at PlayStation for being so incredibly supportive of Dodge Roll and Enter the Gungeon. We wouldn’t be here without you!Enter the Gungeon will be released on April 5, 2016, and we really hope you like it!devolver digitaldodge roll gamesenter the gungeonplaystation gamesaj_hix36 said:March 2nd, 10:03 amThis came out of nowhere, but this game looks really cool!!deafwing said:March 2nd, 4:19 pmI have to agree – I WANT THIS!aj_hix36 said:March 2nd, 10:05 amDo you have a price you can announce yet?SaviorMachine said:March 2nd, 10:08 amI have been awaiting this title for what seems like ages.

(my downstream is ~40mbps, not a problem at all!) is there any chance of network co-op?can you talk about what makes it difficult to bring this game to Vita? Devolver has been great in publishing almost all of these retro-looking titles as cross-buy, so I’m curious what rendering/audio/AI computation makes it not “fit” on the Vita.will PS4 version have 24-bit FLAC audio assets?thanks for answering! :)Dave Crooks said:March 2nd, 3:03 pmHey there! Our levels are very large, with lots of lighting tricks, and tons of stuff happening at once. The game is built in Unity and is actually 3d: https://twitter.com/dodgerollgames/status/593625936131653632Because of these technical reasons, Gungeon would need to be basically re-coded- to run well on the Vita.  I wouldn’t totally rule a Vita version out, as I would love to see it there as well, but we are 100% focused on PS4+PC for the foreseeable future.Fuhr31 said:March 2nd, 12:27 pmAwesome, looks great.  Id be interested in knowing how it controls.  Is the co-op local, online or both?Dave Crooks said:March 2nd, 3:03 pmLocal Co-op!deafwing said:March 2nd, 4:20 pmDamn … no online-coop?  : / that’s kinda sad – game still looks like it would be fun thoughrabidninjamonky said:March 2nd, 1:36 pmLooks great, but I’ll wait for a vita or Android port.cadbane1995 said:March 2nd, 2:16 pmcant wait for this game! will definitely be a day one purchase for methat reminds me….the release date is April 5th. that’s the first tuesday of the month.\ni can smell this game being free for Plus.\nmaybe. xDKazeEternal said:March 2nd, 5:16 pmThis game looks pretty sweet.

Not some over-priced gamed  filled with micro transactions that only proves to be a waste because a “deluxe or XL” edition comes out a year later with all dlc.\nI will be buying this game on 04/05/2016.  The days of arcarde fun are back and better than ever!!Game_Over7983 said:March 8th, 5:03 amI don’t want this on PS Plus. No offense but normal PlayStation Plus users despise Indie and are too toxic. It would break my heart for Gungeon to be chosen for April’s PlayStation Plus Free Games which would make it be hated by the majority of those ”gamers” instead of staying an obscure classic.Pukezor_Galantis said:March 16th, 5:23 pmI’ll wait for the vita launch. Imo, this is the kind of game that suits the vita perfectly.Codfather_Sam said:April 1st, 5:11 amReally excited for this game, what sort of price will it be in the UK?Would you be willing to answer a few brief questions about PlayStation.Blog?"

      "Carlos Mejía Godoy, 75, was Sandinismo’s pre-eminent bard but changed his tune after president’s 2006 re-electionTom Phillips, Latin America correspondentSat 4 Aug 2018 18.00 AEST\n\n\nLast modified on Sat 4 Aug 2018 18.02 AESTOne of Nicaragua’s best-loved musicians – a former Sandinista troubadour who became one of president Daniel Ortega’s fiercest critics – has fled the crisis-stricken Central American nation claiming he feared being killed.“I had to leave Nicaragua because my life was in danger,” the veteran singer-songwriter Carlos Mejía Godoy told the opposition newspaper La Prensa. “I was told to get out as soon as I could.”During the 70s and 80s, Mejía was Sandinismo’s pre-eminent bard, with stirring pro-revolution anthems such as Nicaragua Nicaragüita, Las mujeres del Cuá and the Sandinista hymn La Consigna.But the singer-songwriter, who is now 75, changed his tune after Ortega’s 2006 re-election, like many disillusioned Sandinistas who sensed their movement had lost its way.In 2008 Mejía accused Ortega of building a “family dictatorship” that was a “sordid replica” of Somoza’s tyranny and demanded the Sandinista Front stop using his songs.A decade on – and with Nicaragua in the midst of an anti-Ortega insurrection that has claimed hundreds of lives – Mejía has again been speaking, and singing, out. “We live in a country where life is worth nothing but the people must carry on struggling in the streets,” he told El País last month, denouncing Ortega as “the apocalypse”.In an open letter to Nicaragua’s embattled president, Mejía wrote: “Daniel, stop this genocide now … stop this barbarity … stop the killing!!!”The former Sandinista balladeer has also been penning new songs in support of the protesters, among them Monimbó siempre con vos, a tribute to one Nicaraguan neighbourhood that rose up against Ortega.Mejía is now in neighbouring Costa Rica, where he joins a growing exodus from Nicaragua – until recently considered one of Central America’s most stable nations.Last week the United Nations said 23,000 Nicaraguans were seeking asylum in Costa Rica as a result of the “mounting political tensions, violence and serious human rights violations” back home. Others have fled to Panama, Mexico and the United States.During a recent fundraising event for Nicaraguan refugees at a jazz club in Costa Rica’s capital, San José, student leaders vowed to continue their fight for democracy, in or outside of the country.“I know it will be a long, hard and painful process,” Zayda Hernández told the audience. “But one day we will be able to go back and celebrate inside our country – with our families and with all of our compañeros – and say: ‘We did it!’”“It is our responsibility to put an end to this dictatorship,” she added. “Nicaragua has said: ‘No more!’ And that’s the way it’s going to be.”",

Home Office Secretary Sajid Javid said that the practice has no place in British society. The comments come as the Home Office has come under fire for failing to protect British women and teenage girls forced into abusive marriages.Sputnik spoke with Jasvinder Sanghera, a best-selling author, campaigner, speaker and founder of Karma Nirvana, a leading charity born out of personal experiences of forced marriages and honor abuse.Sputnik: How did you manage to escape forced marriage?Jasvinder Sanghera: I was born in England, I went to school in England and I watched my sisters who were all forced into marriages at the age of 15 years old and nobody asked any questions back then. When I was 14, my mother showed me a photograph of a man I was promised to at the age of 8 and I said, no, I'm not marrying a stranger, I was born in England, I want to go to school.READ MORE: UK Home Office Accused of Failing Victims of Forced Marriage in Visa ScandalMy mother was very clear that I would not put shame on the family and marry this man. So I was taken out of education and then at the age of 16, I managed to escape. So I ran away from home and my family‘s position was I had to go come back and marry this man or I was now dead in their eyes; so I never went back and I became a campaigner because my sister, Robina, tragically committed suicide, she set herself on fire and she died.Sputnik: How did your parents react to your refusal?Jasvinder Sanghera: They were very clear that saying no was not an option and I was held a prisoner at home until I agreed to the marriage. I was physically abused, psychologically abused and not allowed to go to school.Sputnik: What is the scope of this problem in Britain?Sputnik: The Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, pledged to do more to combat forced marriages; how sufficiently addressed is this issue at present?Jasvinder Sanghera: We're pleased to hear him say this, other home secretaries have said this in the past, I just hope that it is his intention now to look at the issue seriously. We know that over 40 visas have been granted to people to enter to the UK on the back of a forced marriage. Now, forced marriage is a criminal offense in Britain, so will these 40 people now be investigated for possible criminal offenses?READ MORE: To Curb Dowry, India's Top Court Wants Full Disclosure of Marriage ExpensesBecause I believe they need to; and also, we have a real issue where our police officers, social workers and teachers are not taking this seriously enough. They need to be trained to recognize that this is not a cultural issue, this is an issue of abuse and this is what needs to change. I'm pleased the home secretary has said this, but I hope that we see changes now.Sputnik: What are the roots of this problem?Jasvinder Sanghera: What we have to recognize is that these are families that have a belief and value system that there is tradition, which is an arranged marriage; we do not have any issue where people are consenting to marriages and there's an arrangement to the marriage, but what can happen is in these families — what they do is is when a young person says no, I don't want to marry, they force them, and they force them because they're trying to contain the practice of an arranged marriage.Sputnik: What is your advice to young women and girls who find themselves in this situation?Jasvinder Sanghera: When it happened to me 38 years ago there was no support available, today it's very different. The important thing to do is to talk to somebody that you trust. You can report it to the police and if you do, talk to the police and explain to the police not to talk to your family, because they may not understand that the family are the perpetrators.READ MORE: Twitter Ablaze as Ex-US Prez Carter Says 'Jesus Would Approve of Gay Marriage'Importantly, you can call a helpline, at Karma Nirvana we have a website, we have a helpline; if you call us, we never ever talk to your family. The important thing is that you speak to somebody that you trust and do not leave the country. If you are worried that you may be going on a holiday with your family but you could be forced into marriage, the important thing is to not go and then talk to somebody about that, because we can help you in this country, we can help you if you're out of this country too, but you need to know the numbers for the numbers for the Forced Marriage Unit and also the helpline numbers.Sputnik: Some cases are said to go unchallenged by authorities. What is the reason for their inaction?Jasvinder Sanghera: Many cases go unchallenged by the authorities and the sad thing is it's because they are not looking at the victim as being abused by somebody from their family members. So when we think about children under the age of 16, who are being forced to marry [with the] family organizing their marriages, what the authorities are doing is they are talking to their parents and they're taking their parents word for it.We need to challenge these people and also cases have been put forward where people have been charged, but they have not progressed into a criminal prosecution. We have to challenge the police, we have to challenge the Crown Prosecution Service and ask the question: \"why, for all the thousands of cases that are seen every year, have there have only been two criminal convictions in England?\"; that cannot be right, the law has been there since 2014.Sputnik: According to your website, your charity organization helps both men and women affected by honor-based abuse and forced marriages. I was really surprised because I didn't know men faced this problem too. Can you elaborate more on that?Jasvinder Sanghera: Yes, we support men and women, and we have since 2008, because the male experience and people overlook it, because men often have more freedom and independence than females, and that is still the case; however, what we have to remember is that very often, when it comes to marriage, they are still victims of forced marriage, because their family will say to them: \"you have to now marry who we say, you have to uphold the honor of the family and pass on these traditions, and, as a man, the responsibilities is on your shoulders\"; and they are forced into marriages.READ MORE: Woman in Plural Marriage Granted Benefits as Single by Swedish CourtWe get over 800 calls every month on our helpline and around 25% of our callers are men calling the helpline.

      "PopularIt is a saga that has run and run since erupting late in 2014. After the flashpoints of the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Pyeongchang followed by the FIFA World Cup in Russia itself earlier this year, many hope the issue will finally soon run its course.We often get told that, with so many other doping concerns to get our teeth into, we should give Russia a rest and focus on problems closer to home.And yet the resignation of Rob Koehler as deputy director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) last week highlights how Russia remains perhaps the single driving factor defining the politics of world sport behind the scenes.It has created, fermented and ripped wide open cracks between the International Olympic Committee (IOC), world governing bodies and those responsible for anti-doping and the current state of deadlock could reach another boiling point over the next few months.Koehler's departure remains shrouded in mystery and all that we have heard officially is that he sent a letter to WADA President Sir Craig Reedie informing him of his sudden plans to resign.I have been told that tensions have grown between him and Sir Craig which escalated at the Athletes’ Forum in Calgary earlier this year and that relations have never been the same since. On the other hand, others suggest we may be getting carried away and Koehler may be maximising a planned departure for political purposes.In comparison with some of his senior WADA colleagues, the Canadian was considered a hawkish figure on Russia. He has often been charged with providing updates on the issue but, more importantly, he had worked increasingly closely with the Athlete Committee as they repeatedly urged a harsh Russian punishment.Rightly or wrongly, he was considered by some to be responsible for strong views held by Athlete Committee chair Beckie Scott - a charge I am not sure about as Scott, a former cross-country skier directly affected by Russian doping, is perfectly capable of formulating her own views.\"Russia is not the only factor in these tensions,\" I was told. \"But it is the most important one.\"The IOC, if you can bear to cast your minds back, debated long into the night on the eve of the Olympic Closing Ceremony in Pyeongchang whether to lift their suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee. They ultimately decided not to, a decision considered unavoidable following two Russian doping failures during the Games, but then lifted it anyway three days later when the spotlight had shifted.Nicole Hoevertsz, the chair of an IOC panel tasked with sanctioning Russia, then said it was time for IFs to \"step up to the plate\" and prosecute cases.We have since seen one case in biathlon and others in athletics.From every other sport? Nothing.Winter IFs seem to be burying the issue under as much snow and ice as they can find while the International Swimming Federation threw all allegations into deep water virtually as soon as they emerged in 2016.Some of the smaller bodies are probably reluctant to press cases that they don't think they can win and it is possible that they are awaiting WADA assistance. Others simply don't care.After numerous delays, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) published two reasoned decisions explaining their decisions to either sanction or clear athletes disciplined by the IOC for doping at Sochi 2014.We were told in early June that further cases relating to 37 other athletes would be trickled out by the end of July but have heard no updates since. It is not clear if the IOC and relevant IFs have been informed about cases which have not been made public.The IOC have also stepped up their wider campaign to return Russia to the international fold.WADA Executive Committee and Foundation Board meetings in Montreal in May became increasingly tense when sporting representatives, led by influential IOC member and Global Association of International Sports Federations chief Patrick Baumann, repeatedly urged the organisation to abandon their Russian road-map and declare the country compliant despite key criteria remaining outstanding.Sir Craig and WADA director general Olivier Niggli stayed neutral and did not intervene.Both sides have been engaged in mudslinging, but there have been subtle attempts to undermine those - like Scott and Koehler as well as past and present IOC members Adam Pengilly and Richard Pound, United States Anti-Doping Agency bigwig Travis Tygart and WADA vice-president Linda Helleland - who have stood firm. I have been told that the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavia-heavy WADA Foundation Board is too influenced by geopolitics and is biased against Russia, but most of their arguments seem reasonable.On the one hand, the IOC are only responding to the criticism that they have themselves faced. But they do seem to be clamouring for Russia to return to the fold with a far greater zeal than they usually pursue anti-doping.Bach also attended the World Cup final in Moscow and met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in another sign of the way the wind is blowing.WADA compliance will presumably allow the International Association of Athletics Federations and the International Paralympic Committee to lift their suspensions of Russia.Of the two outstanding criteria, one concerns an acceptance of the conclusions of the McLaren Report conclusion that an \"institutional doping\" scheme did exist. Russia will never fully do this, to avoid losing face, but has gone some way towards doing so. It is becoming a rather nauseating semantic dispute and there is no point dragging this out too long.The second point relates to the opening up of the Moscow Laboratory for WADA to fully access far more complete electronic records than what they have already seen in the Laboratory Information Management System they obtained last year, without Russian help.If, as is claimed, there is genuine information which can still be accessed, to abandon this ambition and allow Russia to continue with their cover-up would show a complete disregard to get to the bottom of perhaps the greatest doping scandal ever.An Executive Committee meeting in the inauspicious location of Seychelles on September 20 will mark the next battleground.In the meantime, Russian influence is growing again in world sport. Steel tycoon Vladimir Lisin seems destined to take over as President of the International Shooting Sport Federation this year, unless an Italian barred from standing against him is successful in an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.Uzkekistan's Gafur Rakhimov, a Russian passport holder who counts Moscow among his places of residence, is also seeking to become permanent President of the International Boxing Association.An International Biathlon Union Congress in Croatia next month is also one to keep an eye on.Sweden's Olle Dahlin is the favourite to replace Anders Besseberg as President but is facing opposition from Latvian Biathlon Federation President Baiba Broka. According to the rumour mill, Russian officials are lobbying heavily for Broka as she will afford them a more sympathetic stance when the Austrian police investigation into alleged corruption surrounding Russia and the ex-IBU leadership is completed in December. We shall see.In the meantime, expect more sporting bodies to begin awarding events to Russia again, following the trend set by Moscow being named host of next year’s European Beach Volleyball Championships last month.It is certainly important to focus on the many other doping scandals affecting countries all over the world.But the fallout of affairs in Russia is not quite over yet and a delicate path between genuine anti-doping and political expediency is still being sought.Russian doping is a subject now considered increasingly boring by many people.Since joining insidethegames.biz in 2013, Butler has travelled to a variety of major global sporting events, including the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games as well as the most recent editions of the Asian, European and Pan American Games in Incheon, Baku and Toronto.

      "August 5, 2018 marks the one year anniversary of Ernst Zündel’s passing. He was essentially kidnapped from the U.S. and forced to remain in Germany. His wife, Ingrid Rimland, was unable to leave the U.S. to be with him. She risked jail time in Germany despite having no previous criminal convictions.His crime? Ernst Zündel was deemed a “security threat.” Not because he was ever violent or ever incited violence, but because he created a legal precedent in which:For the first time ever, “Holocaust” survivors and “Holocaust” historians were closely and critically questioned under oath about their claims and views.Few Canadians realize that Zündel did them “a favor by wiping off the books [the] disgraceful False News laws” strangling free-speech.An adapted extract from Revisionists. com.Ernst Zündel (1939-2017) was a German-born publisher, author and civil rights activist, who emigrated to Canada at the age of 19. He became a successful graphic artist, with his work appearing, for example, on the front cover of Canada’s national news magazine, Maclean’s. Setting aside his thriving career, he dedicated himself to the great task, as he saw it, of redeeming the sullied reputation of his fellow Germans.For seven years he was held behind bars, first in Canada and then in Germany, solely for the peaceful expression of non-conformist views. For some time he was the most prominent political prisoner in the western world.Zündel was an outgoing, good-humored man who was blessed with a rare combination of unflagging optimism and practical ability. He was perhaps best known as the defiant defendant in the much-publicized “Holocaust Trials” of 1985 and 1988. He was brought to court in Toronto on a charge of “publishing false news,” and specifically for publishing a reprint edition of a booklet entitled Did Six Million Really Die?Zündel’s two lengthy trials were something close to full scale debates on the Holocaust issue.For the first time ever, “Holocaust” survivors and “Holocaust” historians were closely and critically questioned under oath about their claims and views.To wage the legal battle that was forced upon him, he brought together an impressive international team of researchers, legal specialists, scholars, and many others. From numerous libraries and archives in North America and Europe, this group assembled at the “Zündelhaus” in Toronto one of the most extensive collections of evidence anywhere on this chapter of history.Among those who testified on Zündel’s behalf in the trials were Robert Faurisson, David Irving, Mark Weber, William Lindsey, Udo Walendy, and Bradley Smith. As a result of the two trials, an enormous quantity of evidence and testimony challenging the prevailing Holocaust narrative was presented to the court and thereby was made part of the permanent public record. Perhaps the most important evidence was the historic testimony of American gas chamber expert Fred Leuchter concerning his on-site forensic examination of the alleged extermination gas chambers in Poland.Zündel was found guilty in the 1985 trial, but the verdict was set aside by the provincial appeals court. It ruled that the judge in that trial had, among other things, given improper instructions to the jury, and had improperly excluded defense evidence. At the conclusion of the second Zündel trial in May 1988, a jury declared him guilty. A few days later, he was sentenced to nine months imprisonment.French scholar Robert Faurisson wrote at the time:On appeal, Canada’s Supreme Court threw out the 1988 conviction, declaring on August 27, 1992, that the archaic “false news” law under which Zündel had been tried and convicted was a violation of the country’s Charter of Rights. This was more than a personal vindication by Canada’s highest court; Ernst Zündel secured an important victory for the rights of all Canadians.His next great legal battle was fought before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal [which operates outside of normal legal standards] in Toronto. The charges, instigated by Jewish groups, accused Zündel of promoting “hatred or contempt” against Jews through the “Zündelsite” website operated by Ingrid Rimland from the United States. In this legal action, as the Tribunal’s presiding Commissioner declared, the truth or validity of the supposedly “hateful” items was not a consideration. (Ultimately the Tribunal declared the “Zündelsite” to be unlawful, but because it is based in the U.S., the ruling has been unenforceable).During the 42 years he lived in Canada (1958-2000), Ernst Zündel was never convicted of a crime. He was, however, repeatedly a victim of violence and hate. He survived three assassination attempts, including by arson and pipe bomb. Even Irv Rubin, the American Jewish Defence League leader, was caught breaking into Zündel’s home with a member of the “Jewish Armed Resistance Movement” who had previously claimed responsibility for one of the arson attacks. He also endured years of legal harassment and repeated imprisonment.After more than four decades in Canada, including a failed effort to acquire Canadian citizenship, Zündel moved to the United States. On February 5, 2003, Ernst Zündel was arrested at home in the mountain region of eastern Tennessee. U.S. authorities seized him on the pretext that he had violated immigration regulations, or had missed an interview date with U.S. immigration authorities, even though he had entered the U.S. legally, was married to Ingrid Rimland, an American citizen, had no criminal record, and was acting diligently, and in full accord with the law, to secure status as a permanent legal resident.After being held for two weeks, he was deported to Canada. For two years — from mid-February 2003 to March 1, 2005 — he was held in solitary confinement in the Toronto West Detention Centre as a supposed threat to national security.His arrest and detention generated widespread media attention. A few Canadian newspapers and several independent analysts acknowledged the injustice of his incarceration. The country’s most prestigious daily, the Toronto Globe and Mail, affirmed in an editorial (“Zündel doesn’t warrant a security certificate,” March 6, 2004) that he posed no risk to people or property, and that he was being held unjustly on a bogus “guilt by association” pretext.In another editorial (“The Zündel Case,” Oct. 23, 2004) the influential paper called Canada’s treatment of Zündel an “abuse of the secret-trial legislation.”Bill Dunphy, a veteran investigative journalist and editor for the daily Hamilton Spectator, also protested the injustice. He spent six years probing Canada’s “white supremacist” movement, and got to know Zündel well. Although he has no sympathy for Zündel’s views, in a hard-hitting column (Hamilton Spectator, May 14, 2003) he told readers:Zündel was held in Canada not because his views are unpopular, or because he was a “security risk.” He was in prison because Jewish groups wanted him there, and because he promoted views that the Jewish-Zionist lobby considers harmful to its interests.This lobby was the decisive, critical factor in the decades-old campaign to silence him. The only sustained and institutionalized effort in Canada to imprison Zündel came from this lobby, which includes the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Canadian Jewish Congress, the Canadian Holocaust Remembrance Association, and the League for Human Rights of B’nai B’rith (Canada’s counterpart to the U.S.-based “Anti-Defamation League”).On March 1, 2005, Zündel was deported to Germany, just as Jewish groups had been demanding. Upon his arrival at Frankfurt airport, he was immediately arrested and taken to Mannheim prison to await trial for the “thought crime” of “denying the Holocaust.”A few months later the public prosecutor in Mannheim formally charged Zündel with inciting “hatred” by having written or distributed texts that “approve, deny or play down” genocidal actions carried out by Germany’s wartime regime, and which “denigrate the memory of the [Jewish] dead.” …. The 14 specific violations cited by the court included postings on the U.S.-based “Zündelsite” website. The court thus upheld efforts by German authorities to punish individuals for writings that are legal in the country where they are published. Jewish groups quickly, and predictably, expressed approval of the verdict.Zündel was released from prison on March 1, 2010 — five years after his deportation to Germany, and three years after his conviction by a court in Mannheim. Banned from returning to either Canada or the U.S., he went to his family home in Germany’s Black Forest region, where he resided until his death. Unable to leave the U.S. and be with him, his wife Ingrid Rimland died two months later.WearsWar recommends The Barnes Review (TBR) journal to anyone interested in real history. Founded in 1994 by Willis Carto, TBR is a semi-monthly magazine designed to publish history not available in most establishment publications. Named after historian Harry Elmer Barnes, the goal of TBR is “to bring history into accord with the facts.”[1]The prior May/June 2018 issue of TBR, for example, has an article documenting that James Earl Ray was not the lone assassin of Martin Luther King. This article shows that the real culprits—certain agencies of the federal government—got away with the crime because of the cooperation of a compliant news media.[2] Similarly, this TBR issue documents that Sirhan Sirhan did not murder Robert F. Kennedy. The evidence shows that the fatal shots that killed RFK came from the rear, and that prosecutorial misconduct along with Sirhan’s “defense” attorney sold him down the river.[3]TBR is best known for its Holocaust revisionism and defense of Germany’s actions during World War II. TBR is not adverse, however, to publishing factual articles that put National Socialist Germany in an unfavorable light. For example, TBR published an article by John Wear that discussed the illegal medical experimentation at Dachau during World War II.[4] TBR also published another article by John Wear documenting strong evidence of the existence of Germany’s euthanasia program.[5]TBR is also not adverse to publishing articles that correct articles previously published by TBR. For example, two TBR articles had stated that National Socialist Germany was close to building a nuclear bomb during World War II. TBR later published an article by John Wear contradicting these articles by showing that Germany did not have the material and technical resources for such a massive project.[6]TBR is necessary because our mass media and educational system often suppress real history and fail to discuss the power of Jews and Zionists in our political system. Dr. Matthew Raphael Johnson writes:TBR is unlike any other history magazine on the market. We strongly recommend that our readers subscribe to TBR to learn real history that is suppressed by our controlled media.ENDNOTES[1] Tiffany, John, The Barnes Review, “A Titan & His Legacy,” Vol. XXII, No. 1, January/February 2016, p. 3.[2] Shannan, Pat, The Barnes Review, “Who Really Killed Martin Luther King?,” Vol. XXIV, No. 3, May/June 2018, pp. 40-45[3] Shannan, Pat, The Barnes Review, “Don’t Forget RFK,” Vol. XXIV, No. 3, May/June 2018, pp. 58-64.[4] Wear, John, The Barnes Review, “Medical Experimentation at Dachau,” Vol. XIX, No. 3, May/June 2013, pp. 44-49.[5] Wear, John, The Barnes Review, “Euthanasia in the Reich,” Vol. XXII, No. 5, September/October 2016, pp. 34-40.[6] Wear, John, The Barnes Review, “WWII Atomic Debate: Axis Powers Were Nowhere Close to Developing A-Bombs,” Vol. XXII, No. 4, July/August 2016, pp. 42-45.[7] Johnson, Matthew Raphael, The Barnes Review, “What Makes TBR Different,” Vol. XXII, No. 4, July/August 2016, p. 3.Accountant by day, censored historical sleuth by night!\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tView all posts by wearswarAdd CommentAnother ethno-patriot destined for tomorrow’s Hall of Martyrs.

      "134.2m sharesOn Thursday, findings from a six-month investigation by the Times revealed that young British girls are being flown abroad and forced into arranged marriages so that their foreign ‘husbands’ can get a UK visa.It also revealed the failings by the Home Office to address this issue.They have been aware of it for some time – especially as past Select Committee inquires heard statements from witnesses and survivors repeatedly share accounts of how forced marriages are a tool for gaining entry to Britain, and that the Home Office isn’t blocking these visa requests.As a society, we should all acknowledge this failure and we cannot allow it to become yesterday’s news.I myself was 14-years-old when I was presented with a picture of an older man and told I had been promised to him since I was eight.I ran away from the marriage, and was subsequently disowned by my family.To maintain our family honour, my younger sister was forced to marry the man I refused.Now, 35 years later, I have no regrets – because my children will not inherit this legacy of abuse.Home is where a child is meant be safest.But, for some teenagers, it has now become the least safe place to be, and especially at this time of the year, during the school summer holidays.Parents and other family members use this time as the ideal opportunity to coerce victims into engagements and marriages, often disguised as a holiday or bereavement abroad.The victims then find themselves trapped in an alien country, faced with having to marry a stranger as the only way of returning home to Britain.A wedding is hurriedly planned and the victim is sworn to secrecy, under threats that include being disowned if he or she breaks their silence.By this time, the family is already planning the application for her husband, colluding and masterminding ways to ensure a visa is granted.The victim becomes a pawn, and many also force the women to consummate the marriage or become pregnant, through repeated rape.We must understand that any marriage without consent is de facto rape.The family decides when the victim is allowed to return home and she is forced to sponsor the abuser through death threats, severe emotional blackmail and threats to her siblings.This is why it’s so difficult for victims to seek out help or report it to the authorities.Having said that, this recent investigation by The Times evidences how – despite these threats – many victims courageously came forward and requested that the visas of those they were forced to marry be blocked.This courage must not be underestimated, as the victim is going against her family and will be extremely isolated once having done so.Last year, documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act demonstrated that the Home Office received 175 enquiries about people in forced marriages trying to block visas for their spouses. Out of these, they dealt with 88 cases.This included cases where either a victim had come forward, had their case reported by a third party, or an official suspecting a forced marriage had filed a report.However, 42 of the visas – almost half – were still issued.A word of caution for all when reading this figure, as this issue remains severely under-reported.The fact is that immigration laws mean women and girls can only be sure to prevent their spouse from coming to Britain if they sign a public statement.Most will not do this, because the legal document can be seen by their families, putting them at increased risk of harm for blowing the whistle.These facts are not new; what remains shocking is how irresponsible it is of the government to know about it and still not seek to change it.Despite forced marriage becoming a criminal offence in 2014, and thousands reporting this crime, there have only been two convictions in England since.Why is there still reluctance to prosecute these criminals?Will those that have been granted visas on the back of a forced marriage, as well as their families, now be investigated for possible criminal offences?Lest we forget, we are in the school summer holidays time of year and many victims will already have been taken out of Britain for the purposes of a forced marriage.MORE: Girls talk candidly about the realities of forced underage marriages in BangladeshMORE: Thousands of girls in the UK are forced into marriages every year – here’s what you can doMORE: Family tried to force boy to get married after agreement was made when he was fiveIf you are in a sensitive situation and need help or support, you can email Karma Nirvana or call their helpline on 0800 5999 247.",

      "News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services.The Home Sec said forced marriage was a 'despicable, inhumane, uncivilised practice that has no place in Britain'HOME Secretary Sajid Javid has vowed to do more to combat forced marriages as he said the practice had no place in British society.Charities have warned that the Home Office has failed to protect British women and teenage girls forced into abusive marriages by granting their foreign husbands visas.Mr Javid said forced marriage was a “despicable, inhumane, uncivilised practice that has no place whatsoever in Britain”.He added: “We will be doing more to combat it and support victims.“Those who force British women into marriage, be warned that we are redoubling our efforts to make sure you pay for your crimes.”His comments came after data obtained by The Times revealed that officials dealt with nearly 90 cases of victims trying to block visas last year, although almost half were still issued.Women and girls are being physically and sexually abused by the men whose cases go unchallenged by authorities, charities say.One group said some immigration officials were “turning a blind eye” amid concerns over cultural or religious sensitivities.A Home Office source says it “categorically denies” the allegation.Figures released under Freedom of Information laws showed the Home Office had received 175 inquiries about victims trying to block spouses’ visas last year.Of these, 88 became full cases, which included direct requests from victims, known as “reluctant sponsors”, requests from third parties or instances where an official suspected a forced marriage.The women had been forced to marry men in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates.Visas were still issued in 42 cases, while in 10 more the decision is still pending or an appeal is being heard.\nForced marriage victim support charity Karma Nirvana said it was being alerted to cases nationally.Founder Jasvinder Sanghera told The Times: “Even when officials know it’s a forced marriage, they see tradition, culture or religion and they’re reticent to deal with it. They are turning a blind eye.”Laws making it illegal to force someone into marriage in England and Wales were introduced in 2014.Anyone found guilty of doing so can be jailed for up to seven years.As well as banning the practice, police were given powers to issue Forced Marriage Protection Orders to help protect victims, breaches of which are punishable by up to five years in prison.In 2013, the year before laws were introduced, the Government’s Forced Marriage Unit gave advice or support related to a possible forced marriage to more than 1,300 people.In 2017 the unit gave advice or support in 1,196 cases.Mr Javid said that “despite excellent Government work since 2010” combating forced marriage, “more needs to be done”.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: “The Government has been too slow to act on preventing domestic abusers being granted visas through marriage. It also has no idea of the scale of the problem.“Government immigration policy means that people in the system are routinely disregarded. But not listening to vulnerable women can have terrible consequences and lead to a life of abuse.“Immigration applicants must be heard, and the Government must act decisively on this issue.”©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. 679215 Registered office: 1 London Bridge Street, London, SE1 9GF. \"The Sun\", \"Sun\", \"Sun Online\" are registered trademarks or trade names of News Group Newspapers Limited.

      "By \nMegabyte,  December 25, 2016 in Game ShowcaseHi, its my firsh HTML5 game, I made it after playing PIxel Dungeon : )For UI i used react.js. Gameplay part is canvas+js. No any other frameworks. Maybe for next my game ill take phaser. : )Features:You can play it here: https://pixel-cave.comAbout any bugs you can report me in game menu. : ) I've fixed some bugs, reported via these menu already.This looks really great. I've only played it for a short amount of time, but very nice.I like the Reactjs approach - it's something I have been playing with as well and am finding I can easily transfer my day job (webdev) knowledge onto gamedev. Did you come across any major hiccups with using React?Thnak you.React gived no any problems. I worried about performance of elements which overlap canvas, but looks like it doesn't give any impact. I update ingame UI not each frame. 4 times per second only.This looks really great. I've only played it for a short amount of time, but very nice.I like the Reactjs approach - it's something I have been playing with as well and am finding I can easily transfer my day job (webdev) knowledge onto gamedev. Did you come across any major hiccups with using React?Very cool very cool.Great game!I really like this game.  The graphics are charming and it is very well polished.  I am only missing sounds and music.Thank you Tom, and Sanojian. I desided to omit sounds, because i played PixelDungeon for some months and always disable sound : ) Maybe ill add sounds soon.Very nice game, do you plan on selling it for exclusive / non-exclusive license ? Anyway congrats for all the work you have put into it.Really well made. Liked it alot, just couldn't get far enough! Not enough potions to take me all the wayMy planes for now, just keep it on my web site and look if people will like to play it : ) And make next levels step by sptep.Maybe game too hard, as it is happen when some one make game for him self : ) Maybe i have to add easy/normal mode choosing?Very nice game, do you plan on selling it for exclusive / non-exclusive license ? Anyway congrats for all the work you have put into it.Really well made. Liked it alot, just couldn't get far enough! Not enough potions to take me all the wayI couldn't get past the hive yet, but it's pretty nice. Personally I prefer roguelikes to not be real time, but most people probably like real time better so that is understandable.\n\tI think the difficulty is at a good level for what it is and the game is fun, I like it better than pixel dungeon, unless I'm thinking of something elseI decided make it realtime to make it's different from another roguelikes : ) Some time i want to pass difficult places in step by step mode too. But for really hard places you can slowdown speed of battle in settings menu. So you will have more time for fast intems management.I couldn't get past the hive yet, but it's pretty nice. Personally I prefer roguelikes to not be real time, but most people probably like real time better so that is understandable.\n\t\t\tI think the difficulty is at a good level for what it is and the game is fun, I like it better than pixel dungeon, unless I'm thinking of something elseok, that is an alright compromiseNice game! Giving it real time gameplay makes it intense!How did you implement the fog of war?This file contains 256 variants of fog for one tile. Tile on map has 8 neigbor tiles. Check if all 8 neighbors visible or not, and so get 8 bits. This 8 bits is 0-255 numeric index, by this index we take fog tile on texture i showed.How did you implement the fog of war?Wow, that's really cool. Is that the same as the line-of-sight system? How do you get the line-of-sight to go all the way down a zigzagging diagonal corridor?fog and line-of-sight is not related actually. For line of sight, for each tile i made list of tiles visible from this tile, by simple ray tracing. on each map modification i recalculate lists of visibleTiles. When player go on new tile, just need eterate list of visible tiles and mark visible tiles (tile.isVisible=true);Then on fog draw, check isVisible property for each neighbor tile and calculate fog texture index.Wow, that's really cool. Is that the same as the line-of-sight system? How do you get the line-of-sight to go all the way down a zigzagging diagonal corridor?Is the floor 32 monster with the hood bugged? It takes nearly 0 damage and kills the player within 2-3 hits.THIS!!???!!?=??!! OMG cant get past lvl 32!!Very nice game so far, seems very polished, but I hope to see more updates to the difficulty curve and randomization. Now that I got the hold of it, it's alright difficulty wise for me, besides lvl 32 of cause, but as a first-time player it was super difficult to get past even the first boss or two. Even now though, because of the randomization, some runs I just can't get very far because of poor items / not enough health-potion drops etc. So maybe some kind of rating of items and make them drop at least X amout before lvl 10, 20, 30 etc. instead of what seems like completely random drops.Very nice so far thoughIs the floor 32 monster with the hood bugged? It takes nearly 0 damage and kills the player within 2-3 hits.I see your report in bug reports : ) Thank you. This ghost unit is very powerfull really. But they only one or two per level. So i thought its will be relativly balanced : ) Maybe try to trick him and just run to next level, or kill by paralyzation seed or gas.I made him less powerful anyway : ) - 20%attack and -20% defence. If i remember exactly.Thank you : ) I just made one small update. Added chest of inheritance, now, after death you can choose one item to pass to next life : ) Its like inherit item to your son. Maybe its will make game a bit easier and preexpectable. And one small bug for some browsers was fixed.Thank you all for feedback, i will update and fix bugs as soon as ill have time.Is the floor 32 monster with the hood bugged?

Some of these runs are quite time consuming and I'd like to be able to turn off the computer without losing progress. (For example save allowing the user to copy a string containing all their save info, and load allowing the user to paste that string)Game saves after each level. And if turn of computer you will start from current level next time. If you lose all progress after closing browser, its probably bug, and i have to fix it.I didn make export, because its way to replay levels unlimited times, and its totally kill roguelike idea : )Any chance of adding functionality to export and import save data?

      "Cave Story (Doukutsu Monogatari) is a famous freeware platformer released in 2004 by Studio Pixel. It was translated into English by Shih Tzu of Aeon Genesis in 2005, rapidly gaining fame worldwide and becoming one of the most important indie games. A WiiWare port by Nicalis was released in 2010 and several ports to consoles and handhelds have been made by fans.Cave Story plays like a shooting sidescroller platformer, where the player visit worlds and interact to NPCs and various characters in a RPG fashion. The story is told via events and cutscenes that happen in the game. The world is fairly linear, though it contains an interconnected world, a feature present in traditional metroidvanias (exploration platformers).Throughout the story the player acquires several weapons and upgrades via an experience system. Some other equipment like jetpacks (called \"Booster\") and map systems are also present.The development of Cave Story started prior to 1999 and lasted til the end of 2004, when the game was completed. Between the development of the Beta version and the official version, Studio Pixel developed the game called \"Ikachan\", whose main protagonist is present in a lot of other games by Pixel.Early versions of Cave Story contained different content, worlds, characters and gameplay from the official released version. It's notable that the main character was named \"Curly Brace\", the Balrog character (named Puu in the Beta) was the very last villain of the game and a shop system was present, for buying ammo and other items. The player couldn't shoot upwards or downwards either.Most of the weapons present in the Beta versions are supposedly their final versions. By looking at the screenshots from the beta, one can recognize the Spur, Machine Gun, and others. While most areas had their tilesets changed, you can still recognize the Sand Zone and the Plantation in the Beta.Professor Booster was a different character back then, too. The mimiga named \"Chie\" also had certain importance.By 2003, it's known that the game had already shaped to what we see today, due to Pixel's insatisfaction with level design and his ideas in the early version.Cave Story has been ported to numerous systems, including a PSP port, a Mac port, a Linux port and an X-Box port. A Nintendo DS version was planned, developed and almost completed but with the announcement of the WiiWare version of Cave Story, the development was halted.\nIn 2010, Nicalis together with Pixel release an upgraded version of Cave Story for WiiWare, with updated sprites, songs and translation. This WiiWare version is known for having numerous issues that disappointed several fans, including bugs in music and loading of maps.Cave Story (Start Point)DevelopersPixel, Nicalis (WiiWare port)Released2004 (PC), 2010 (WiiWare)GenrePlatformerModesSingle PlayerPlatformsWindows, WiiwareInputKeyboard, Joystick, WiimoteWebsiteStudio Pixel",

      "One thing I noticed is the awning on the house does not seem to be angled like the rest of the scene. It feels like we're looking at it straight on (like it would be if it were pixelled for a platformer, not top down) and everything else looks like we're viewing it from farther above.Yes right, game not finished, i update it each day. After about 30 leve no new enemies and bosses.Today i  added new boss, and big update with main hero : )Heh I guess I \"beat\" the demo -- nothing but rats for many levels and I fought Scrag twice ;).I know this piece is not the game but i do have to comment the effort, it's simplistic but effective, especially the inventory.interesting concept :]IMO it is better now.Excellent pixelart!Yes yellow I meant yellow pathYes, currently first level is just a trick to make game more interesting at start. I promise to add new artistic levels and locations later : ) Procedural generation is for avoid a lot of work, you are right : )Do you mean yelow path on grass out of bricks? Ok ill try to change colors for it. Thank you for good advice.This is fantastic piece, artwork design and atmosphere. Though one thing I don't like is those yellow boulders. IMO they are way too distractive.Fun game -- made it to the Hive, but my luck ran out.I hoped to see more art like this, but I guess the procedural aspect is tough for larger non-repeating work.Title: pixel cavePixel Artist: megabyte  (Level 1 Rookie :: 15 points)Posted: 10/24/2016 02:17Statistics:  10 comments    11 faves    0 avatars I working on my small Roguelike game, and would like to share picture i made for this project : )\nGame isn't finished yet, but if some one interested to check it:\nhttp://pixel-cave.comTitle:pixel cavePixel Artist:megabyte  (Level 1 Rookie :: 15 points)Posted:10/24/2016 02:17Statistics:10 comments    11 faves    0 avatarsI working on my small Roguelike game, and would like to share picture i made for this project : )\nGame isn't finished yet, but if some one interested to check it:\nhttp://pixel-cave.com",
      "Tired of waiting?\nClick here to disable ads!Use mouse to interact with world,\nUse 'Esc' or 'i' to go to inventory and equit or use items you picked up.Not bad, could use some sound though.Amazing random rogue like action game. You did a great job. Maybe a bit of progression reward for the diehards?Pixel Cave has its charm, I'll give it that. A fun little roguelike game in a simplistic style.Alright, forgive me if I'm sloppy, because I'm pissed. I love this game. The floors are pretty neat and the things you either get from looting, buying, or killing the monsters are also well designed (the fact that some weapons break, some of them can be thrown, and the many different flasks). Although I thought that having to go into your inventory to throw items was tedious because that gave your enemy a small window to attack, which is really annoying when they can paralyze, poison, or burn you. The bosses are fun and different (if not a stronger version) of the regular enemies, but I had trouble with the first one because the items I had didn't exceed its toughness. Speaking of tough enemies (this is the thing I'm pissed about), is the bees. THE BEES ARE ANNOYING AS ALL HELL. Although they die extremely easily, most of the time they are able to hit you. I remember there being at least 15 bees in the stages that included them, and just drained my health. Now the concept of them is good, like maybe there's a bee hive you have to destroy, but I find the amount of bees just satanic! Like in one of the levels, there was a large room, filled to the brim with bees, not to mention the room before ALSO had bees. But besides the bee situation, the game is very enjoyable and with so much different loot, playing it more than once doesn't make the game very predictable. Another part I like is the diluted sight on the level, so A: you don't know what's in the rooms. B: you can't see anything that is in your range of vision (including the places you've already been), which makes you take everything step-by-step instead of running in guns blazing. Now even though you can't see everything at once, allowing players to regenerate on the same stage a couple of times kind of downs the caution levels since you get 5 lives on every stage. Now I'm saying that's a bad thing, as god knows how many times I've died, but maybe just give some lives every few stages (like the boss stages). The dwarf shoppes too are a good feature, as when you sell items you can buy them back, because let's say the item you bought got used up, so if you want it back you can buy it. The only other thing about this game that doesn't make sense to me is why do you just do stuff underground? You spawn in the over world with a house, beautiful scenery (compared to the dungeons), and stone steps that seem to go somewhere. Now there really isn't any story to Joseph's (I'm calling the guy Joseph) adventuring, so it doesn't really make sense to why he can't go in the house, or go exploring in the place you start. The other feature you could add to an over world adventure is dungeons in different areas. The dungeon you go to is just a hole in the ground, so why can't there be other holes that lead to other dungeons?This is a great graphical interpretation of the original rogue dungeon-exploring game. The randomness of items and descending into the dungeon are perfectly captured. Nailed it.You are not logged in.

      "This is a selected list of roguelike video games. Roguelike games are those that incorporate elements of role-playing games with procedural generation, following the formula of genre’s namesake, Rogue. Due to the large number of variations on this concept, roguelikes are normally classified as either being a classical roguelike with qualities that meet the “Berlin Interpretation” for roguelikes, or as hybrid roguelikes, roguelike-likes, roguelites, or procedural death labyrinths, which possess some but not all of these qualities.The following is a list of roguelike games that are generally considered to hold true to the Berlin Interpretation of a “roguelike”.These are games that feature elements of roguelike games but not necessarily all of the features as defined by the Berlin Interpretation. Terms like “hybrid roguelike”, “roguelike-like”, “rogue-lite”, and “procedural death labyrinth” are used to distinguish them from traditional roguelike games. In most cases, hybrids feature common elements like procedural level generation, randomized item and adversary placement, and permadeath.Content is authored by an open community of volunteers and is not produced by or in any way affiliated with or reviewed by PediaView.com.

This is a huge question for Byron Shire\nwith big cost implications. We need to get it right.The draft Management Study examines the options and gives the\nhighest ranking to engineered rock and sand âtransferâ schemes. In\nreaching this conclusion, how have the myriad issues under the\nâsocio-ecologicalâ banner been considered?The loss of the beach and the impacts on the environment,\ntourism and the economy are key questions. Equally important is how\nwell planned retreat has been understood and considered as an\noption. What are the costs of each option and how will we pay?In the study these questions are reduced dispassionately to one\nsimple phrase, Benefit Cost Ratio or BCR. This is an assessment of\nthe economic value of benefits and costs for each option. How did\nthe economist determine the BCR for each option? Answer, by making\nassumptions. Assumptions about the future of house prices, the\neconomy, impacts on tourism and the costs of implementing planned\nretreat among other things. Natural environment is not valued.The Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) have reviewed the\nstudy and produced an alternative analysis that gives planned\nretreat the highest ranking BCR. Amongst other things, the original\nBCR rankings in the study assumed that all the costs of planned\nretreat would occur immediately instead of gradually over time. An\nincredible miscalculation that shows how critical the assumptions\nare. The comments from OEH are appended to Report 13.9 of this\nweekâs council agenda.So, are we going to make a far reaching decision based on a\ncouple of digits without understanding fully the underlying\nassumptions of each BCR?

They have been exacerbated by\nthe effects of the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon, which caused a\nprolonged dry season in Indonesia.Most of the fires have been on peatland, which should be\nprotected, but has been drained, mostly to make way for oil palm\nplantations. Once dried out, the peat is extremely inflammable. The\nfires burn underground and are very hard to extinguish.Indonesiaâs president, Joko âJokowiâ Widodo, said last week that\nhe had instructed the Minister of Environment and\nForestry, Siti Nurbaya, not to grant any new permits on\npeatland.

Paul\nJohnson et al]. This may be the beginning of methane hydrate\ndestabilisation in non-arctic waters.Initially most of the methane is dissolving in the ocean and\nreacting with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. As a result the\ncoastal water is becoming de-oxygenated which is disrupting the\nmarine eco-system. There are enormous quantities of the very\npowerful global warming gas, methane, stored in these hydrates.\nRelease can be expected to follow an exponential trend as a result\nof many natural feedback systems, if we donât act fast.We need to impress upon our political leaders the extreme\nurgency of replacing coal, gas, and oil with renewable energy\nsources.

The interior is\nlush and warm, made more decadent in contrast to the charming grit\nof its Chinatown surrounds.

In adults and\nolder children, this âentrainmentâ is displayed by behaviours such\nas foot-tapping, head-nodding, or drumming. âInfants do not\nsynchronize their external behaviour with the music, either because\nthey lack the requisite physical or mental ability,â Peretz\nexplained. âPart of our study was to determine if they have the\nmental ability.

When Ministers are asked a question in Question\nTime, they are given the primary question in advance. That's part\nof the basic procedures of the House, and it ensures that the\nMinister can prepare and have appropriate information to hand. What\nthis means in practice is that their departments prepare a briefing\nof relevant information, which includes information on possible\nsupplementary questions that may be asked.

This has prompted the\nexpected outpouring on Twitter of comments about \"Chinese names\"\nand so on, which Twyford has brought\nupon himself and fully deserves. But what does the bill\nactually do?\n\nSimple: it requires people buying New Zealand houses to either\nbuild new ones, or actually live here, either permanently or\ntemporarily.\n\nAnd that's a completely defensible idea. Homes are not some sort of\nabstract financial instrument to provide tax-free capital gains to\nabsentee foreign speculators - they're for people to live in. At\nthe moment, their utility as the former seems to be undermining the\nlatter. And that's something a competent government which cared\nabout its people (rather than foreign, tax-cheating speculators)\nwould do something about.\n\nAs for the nitty-gritty, the core provisions largely mirror\nexisting provisions relating to sensitive land.

    "title": "Dead Cells",
    "text": [
      "Dead Cells is a roguelike-metroidvania hybrid video game developed by Motion Twin. It was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on August 7, 2018.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDead Cells is described as a \"roguevania\", a combination of procedurally-generated roguelike games and action-exploration-based metroidvania games. The player controls a mass of cells that occupy and control the body of a deceased prisoner at the start of each game. As they explore a series of dungeons and fight the creatures within, they collect weapons, armor, abilities, power-ups, and money. Some enemies will also drop cells when defeated, which can be used to obtain permanent power-ups such as additional health potions or new items that can be bought or found in later runs. These cells can only be spent at the end of a dungeon section; if a player dies before then, they lose all collected cells.Each level is procedurally generated by merging of predesigned sections in a random configuration along with random placement of enemies and items. The game's combat is said to be similar to the Souls series, with difficult enemies with certain behaviors the player can learn, and where frequent player-character death is a fundamental part of the game. At intervals throughout the game, the player must also defeat boss enemies known as \"Keepers.\" Currently, there are four Keepers in the game—the Incomplete One, The Watcher, The Assassin, and The Hand of the King.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe plot of Dead Cells is minimalistic, only giving bits of information to the player. Taking place on an unnamed island, the player character is referred to as the Prisoner, a humanoid with a smoky flame in place of a head. The Prisoner is a silent protagonist, but occasionally shows some personality traits such as confusion or frustration (giving the finger on several occasions). The Prisoner is immortal, as every time he or she dies their \"head\" manages to lurch it's way back to the starting prison. According to a guard, the Prisoner is said to have been executed for some crime, but the nature of the crime is never specified.\nEvery time the Prisoner dies, the island reconfigures itself, which serves as an explanation for the rogue-like mechanics. In the game, the reason for this is specified as the island being a living organism that evolves over time.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDead Cells's developer Motion Twin had been developing games for the browser and mobile gaming market since 2001. The studio found that competition in the mobile market required more investment to make viable games, and decided to switch focus to develop what they considered their \"passion project\", a game that was \"something hardcore, ultra-niche, with pixel art and ridiculous difficulty\" that they knew would be a potential risk in terms of interested players. Motion Twin's producer, Steve Filby, said that The Binding of Isaac was a significant influence, as there, the way the game proceeds \"is entirely based on the choice of items that you get. That’s the fun of the game.\"Initially, Motion Twin had set out to include more elements of tower defense in the game, having the player drop turrets or similar traps to defeat monsters, but found this was not interesting. They took inspiration of the Engineer class from Team Fortress 2, where the use of turrets and other buildable items helps to strengthen the character's abilities, and took Dead Cells into an action platformer where the player used weapons along with a variety of skills (including some elements they had developed for the tower defense approach). They did not want players to get used to having a single weapon/skill combination that they used indefinitely, and arranged the roguelike elements as to require the player to try out new combinations of weapons and skills as they progressed in a given run to defeat newer foes, and keeping what items they would get in a random manner every time they started a new game. To give the player enough options, the developers crafted about 50 different weapons, avoiding having too much duplication in how each weapon worked so that there would be unique gameplay possibilities with each. The team used an iterative process in gameplay and graphics and art so that each of these weapons also exhibited unique animations or behavior so that the player would get a sense of a tactile response and the special nature of each weapon.Motion Twin opted to use Steam's Early access approach to both gauge interest and to get real-time feedback from players on game features and the balance from procedural generation. Lead designer Sébastien Bénard estimated that 40 to 50% of the features in the final game were drawn from feedback during early access. The early access period was launched on May 10, 2017 with support for Microsoft Windows, and released macOS and Linux versions in early access on June 26, 2018.   In November 2017 the game was also released on GOG.com as part of their drive to provide an alternate way to purchase games that are in development. In January 2018, Motion Twin also stated they are planning on console development for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, with a planned release in August 2018 to correspond with the Windows' version leaving early access. Motion Twin does not anticipate creating a sequel, and instead focused on adding a robust modding system for the personal computer versions to allow players to expand the game following release.Dead Cells is scheduled to launch its full version on August 7, 2018 for computers and consoles. Retail editions of the game are expected to also ship in August 2018.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAbout a year from its early access release, Dead Cells has sold over 730,000 units, and exceeded 750,000 units just prior to its full release.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

      "Jump to navigationMotion Twin is a small, French game development company located in Bordeaux, France. From there, the 10-man team has created a multitude of mobile games. But what happens when they shift over into making a game for PC/console?That result is Dead Cells, a roguelike, Castlevania-inspired, action-platformer. The game combines all of the fun of platformers, without the hassle of trick edges, with the fun of quick and visceral combat in a non-hardware intensive package. While the game is still in Early Access on Steam, Motion Twin plans to release the game on PC, Xbox, Playstation, and Switch.The devs over at Motion Twin took the time to talk with us in an email interview about their first major step into the PC/console world and what it has taken to come this far. For a more in-depth look at Dead Cells, check out our preview of it here.GameCrate: Let’s get the obvious question out of the way first. Can you tell us when you plan to release Dead Cells officially?Motion Twin: We're aiming for Q3/Q4 2018. That’s a vague answer, I’ll give you that. But with the inherent uncertainty of video game development, we would rather announce a definite release date only when we’re sure we won’t miss it.GC: Steam Early access games have gotten a lot of criticism for over-promising and under-delivering, among other things—What has your experience on Early Access been like so far?MT: On our side, the feedback from the community has been invaluable and quite positive. The Early Access had a substantial, constructive, impact on the game, there’s no debate there. From  the players perspective… Do we under-deliver? I guess you’d have to ask them directly, but based on the press and players’ reviews, we seem to be doing a reasonable job of delivering what we say we will. No matter what happens, we always do our best to deliver and explain why we couldn’t if something stops us.GC: Anything you’d change about Steam’s Early Access process?MT: Not the process itself, but the communication tools we have for interacting with the community on Steam could use some love. We would rather keep the discussion in the Steam environment, but if we do it again, we may consider taking the time to build a decent forum with upvote/downvote mechanics for bugs and suggestions to allow us to reduce the “noise” and identify the priorities faster.GC: How dependent have you been on the early access users to give you feedback about balance and gameplay issues? Or even suggestions that have made the game better?MT: We don’t feel dependent on them, in the sense that we’ve always known what we wanted to build. However, when you receive heaps and heaps of feedback and become aware of all the balancing and design issues that the community finds and shares… then you realize that you’re indebted to them for the many improvements we’ve made based on that feedback. It’s more a question of creating a mutually beneficial partnership, we realize our vision, they point out where it’s falling flat, everyone wins.GC: What are the inspirations for Dead Cells? I’ve seen that the Lead Designer Sébastian Bénard said that Left 4 Dead and Faster Than Light were inspirations for the level design, but what about gameplay/combat, art design, and creature design?MT: Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is the primary inspiration for the game, I mean you just have to look at it to see that, but there are of course a stack of others. On the gameplay side, I know this has become a cliché by now, but we were really swayed by the Dark Souls series, especially some of the earlier versions of the game, when there was more focus on observation and taking your time. We gradually shifted toward a fast-paced game but kept the i-frames on the roll, the rally mechanic and the punishing enemy difficulty, as well, it feels great.On the art side, Mark of Wolves for its slick animations with surprisingly few frames, while the use of 3D in a 2D game was a process we found in Blazblue and Guilty Gear Xrd. No Man’s Sky was also an inspiration regarding the vibrant color palettes.GC: About the level design—How hard was it to find that balance between procedurally generated and fixed assets?MT: It’s definitely an intricate process. Since going full procedural didn’t work out, we then tried various formulas before finally settling on the current mix of about 50/50. Basically you want to build something that feels familiar with each run, yet is obviously different. You can’t design the familiarity with full random, so you have to temper it with a good dose of hand designed rooms and levels.GC: Things like the upgrade scrolls have gone through a couple changes so far. How have you approached balancing the game with things like that, or even the newly added foundry?MT: Lots and lots of spreadsheets! And, well, at the risk of sounding like a broken record… community feedback. Basically we design something, implement and release it through the alpha branch to the hardcore players to see what they think. This usually allows us to see very quickly if we’ve got any glaring oversights in there, then we balance based on the stats from players and their feedback on the forums.GC: This is Motion Twins first venture into the PC/console world. What are some major differences you’ve had to deal with in developing for PC/console instead of mobile?MT: Rediscovering a sense of purpose and happiness we had lost a long time ago? I joke, I joke… But the type of F2P games we were making when the internet was really democratizing gaming have transformed into something else. Now you need an analytics and acquisition team that’s bigger than your creative team to get past in that world. So the big challenge was letting go of our old habits and learning to make games based on those subjective qualities, making  “good” games.GC: What about the challenges of developing for PC, Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo at the same time?MT: It’s a manpower issue before anything else. We didn’t have the bandwidth to handle it without slowing the development of the game, so we hired and now we’re good to go.GC: Nintendo has been notorious in the past for being hard to work with if you’re a 3rd party developer. What’s your experience been like?MT: Can’t complain! Interestingly, with Sony progressively backing out of the indie scene, we were expecting to witness Microsoft coming back as the major console partner for indies, XBLA style. They have been trying, but instead Nintendo have really taken the open position through a very indie friendly policy and hardware which is just as easy to work with.GC: Now, Nintendo users have often been described as more casual than those who would play games like Dark Souls. Do you think the style of gameplay that Dead Cells delivers might deter some of the Nintendo player base?MT: Probably. Challenging games can feel frustrating, and that may deter some players, no matter the platform. But on the other hand, the handheld nature of Nintendo’s new system seems tailored to the “short run” nature of the roguelite, so we hope it will balance out if there is anything to compensate for.GC: The randomness of weapons plays a big factor in the game. What would you say to people who would prefer to simply reset until they get a weapon combination they like at the beginning?MT: From our perspective, that seems like a big loss of time. The weapons you find at the beginning will quickly become obsolete. We think making do with what you get and trying new things are part of the charm of Dead Cells, so we try to incite players to experiment through the random weapons perks. But if they prefer to reroll until they get the “right” combination and that’s how they get their kicks, then that’s fine with us too.GC: Speaking of weapons—how many total weapons are there in the game? How many skills?MT: Around 60 weapons (including shields) and 30 skills.GC: Does the dev team have any favorite combinations they use?MT: Frantic sword/Ice bow is quite popular currently, but apart from that we all have different tastes. Some swear only by shields while other are turret lovers… of course they’re all wrong: everyone knows that nothing beats a trap and a good bow.GC: If the team could offer advice to new players what would it be?MT: Roll, roll, roll, and then roll some more.GC: What do you guys think of similar games like Hollow Knight?MT: Similar games? They can expect a letter from our lawyer as soon as they release… Just kidding. We don’t have a lawyer.Hollow Knight is a great game which took another approach to its combat system, offering huge amounts of content, and fully handcrafted level design. And that’s without even mentioning its beautiful art style. In the end it’s definitely a different experience.I think, apart from a strict copycat of Dead Cells, there will always be some differences between two games… And having more alternatives to choose from can only be a good thing.GC: Once Dead Cells is released do you plan to continue to add content to the game?MT: We already committed to offer a first free DLC to every owner of Dead Cells in the months following its release. It’s pretty much as far as we’re able think.GC: What comes after Dead Cells?MT: See our last answer! More games, bigger games, better games… But mostly just games.--You can check out Dead Cells on Steam Early Access for $19.99.

None of its peers feel as good in their moment-to-moment play. The controls are tight, the movement is fluid, and the combat has a real weight to it. Once you get into it, Dead Cells is about this unique state of combat flow, where you're moving, dodging, and killing your way to the end at high-speed. The progression system causes the game to stumble a little, since it's less than satisfying to upgrade a chance at better items dropping. But Dead Cells is a winner overall, especially if you're a player who's all about technique and execution.4.5\n/5Related TagsDead Cells\n Motion Twin\n Nintendo Switch\n roguelikeReactions\n\t\t\t\t\t3Comments\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t5More from USgamerBy Caty McCarthyBy Kat Bailey\n\n\n\n1By Mike Williams\n\n\n\n10By Hirun Cryer\n\n\n\n1Covering the best in video gaming.

I've read of frame rate struggles in other reviews as well, so hopefully the devs cleanup the frame rate for the Switch version at some point soon.Man, I am never, ever going to get to Octopath at this rateI can't wait for tomorrow though I wish I had the day off. I think this will be more my speed than Hollow Knight was. The action tempo of this game looks perfect. I am Hyped for this one. \n@kidgorilla I cannot put down Octopath. It is so damn engaging, just know you have a quality experience waiting in the wings.",
      "John-Paul Jones /\n        August 6, 2018It’s clear that the developers behind Dead Cells recognize that If there is one genre that has gained particular prominence through the indie revolution of the last decade it is most certainly the Metroidvania genre. Spurred upon by the classics such as Metroid and Castlevania, indie developers have not only revisited that well of classical inspiration frequently with stellar titles such as Rogue Legacy, Sundered and Guacamelee! but they have also introduced roguelike elements into the mix that make those games far more enjoyable than they would otherwise be.The latest in a long line of genre efforts, the best has clearly been saved for last because Dead Cells takes the Metroidvania genre and kicks the absolute crap out of it, before picking it up, dusting it off and telling it no uncertain terms how to live its life. Not only the best roguelike of this generation, Dead Cells also makes a compelling case as one of the best games you can get on PS4 right now.Described by developer Motion Twin as a self-styled ‘Roguevania’, Dead Cells follows in the footsteps of previous genre leader Rogue Legacy by blending together the tried and tested beats of 2D side-scrolling Metroidvania efforts with the roguelike gameplay popularized by titles such as the excellent Spelunky.As a lifeless warrior husk animated by what can only be described as a sentient lump of rolling slime-vomit, you must venture through a castle and its surrounding grounds killing, looting and trying to find out just what the heck has happened to everyone who should be alive (but isn’t). Oh and dying – yeah let’s not forget that, because you’ll be doing plenty of it before all is said and done.First let’s start with the combat. Whether you’re intimately sticking swords in faces, or pounding foes into a fine red mist with arrows at range, combat in Dead Cells never feels anything less than incredible. Every strike and every successful hit landed sounds and feels satisfyingly crunchy as enemies shatter into far flung chunks of gore and mildly comical showers of cash. It is, in fact, probably one of the most satisfying things you can experience in gaming right now.Complimenting these disturbingly feel-good vibes, is just how powerful the combat makes you feel and how deceptively sophisticated it can be. In one situation for example, you might find yourself surrounded by enemies, only for you to roll past one foe, spin around and slash them into pieces before turning on a penny and blasting another at range with an arrow, all the while a trap that you deployed earlier freezes a third enemy into place who is then subsequently shattered into bloody ice cubes by your next attack.That was just one way of how to deal with that situation in Dead Cells, and the beauty of Motion Twin’s Roguevania effort is that depending on your play style and how you’ve tailored the abilities of your character, any such combat encounter can be tackled in a multitude of brilliantly violent ways. You see, the combat in Dead Cells is rooted into three core disciplines – Brutality (a focus on damage), Tactics (a focus on ranged damage) and Survival (a focus on damage absorption and defense) and all the equipment that you collect correlates to those disciplines in turn.Where things get really interesting however is that as you advance through the castle and the surrounding areas you will stumble across upgrade tokens that can be used to increase any one of those three disciplines – the benefit being that the better you are in one of them, the better the weapons you are using that tap into that skill are able to scale. And you’ll need to be proficient at fighting things too, because while the regular mobs in Dead Cells are no joke, the damage soaking bosses and elite units that you’ll encounter will demand that both you’re character build and reflexes are on point if you want to have any hope of survival.Of course smacking things until they explode or just don’t move anymore is just one cornerstone of what makes a good Roguevania title. The platforming side of things must also be of equal caliber and again, Dead Cells exceeds expectations here too. Controlling Dead Cell’s sword swinging hero is nothing less than a joy, as he remains ultra-responsive to any command that you issue and deftly leaps and clambers about the place with all the grace of a super-slinky feline wearing a Sam Fisher stealth suit.Ostensibly, the incentive to continue once you’ve died is the hallmark of any decent roguelike, and Dead Cells also overachieves in this regard by providing players with a massive range of things that you can improve each time you play. The incentive for replaying Dead Cells largely manifests in two main forms. The first of these is the titular Dead Cells themselves – blue orbs that are acquired from fallen enemies, these can be invested at the end of every level to unlock new weapons, upgrades, buffs and much more besides. This being a roguelike however, should you die before you get a chance to spend them – you’ll lose them forever which introduces a brutal though pulse-pounding risk/reward dynamic to the proceedings.The other roguelike incentive that Dead Cells provides is the unlocking of previously inaccessible areas. With 11 very different, procedurally generated parts of the castle to visit, each boasting its own set of enemies, traps and secrets, there will be areas that you cannot reach until you have acquired the power to do so. Yet when you do (usually from defeating an elite or boss level enemy) it unlocks a whole new set of locations for you to explore that in turn provide extra gear, bonuses and of course, extra Cells for you to spend.Adding to the overall experience is the fact that there is a cheeky sense of humor that seemingly surges throughout every strand of Dead Cells design DNA. In short, Dead Cells knows how to have fun and makes sure that every rage-quit is a trade off for a hearty chuckle or two before the fact. It also doesn’t hurt that the main character is a frequently cheeky asshole whose tone deaf quips and dry humor rarely fails to elicit a positive face crease.As assured as the baseline mechanics are in Dead Cells, so too is the audiovisual presentation of a similar heady quality. With a distinctly super colorful, low-res bleeding pixel style veneer that lends Dead Cells an entrancing aesthetic, and a soundtrack that also enthralls with its careful arrangement of strings that accompany the on-screen action superbly, Dead Cells is a supremely stylish Roguevania to say the least.As a complete package, Dead Cells is just fantastic. Every playthrough is not just fresh and rewarding, but also manages to offer some new tantalizing hook that anchors you to its boundlessly brilliant design. Dead Cells is absolutely firing on all cylinders and is, as of right now, one of the most essential games you can get for PS4 right now.Dead Cells is the most impressive roguelike Metroidvania since Rogue Legacy came onto the scene all those years ago and destroyed my social life so very completely – and if that isn’t a ringing recommendation, I’m not sure what would be to be honest. We’d give it 9.75/10 if we could, but y’knowâ¦Dead Cells is out on August 7. 2018 for PS4, Xbox One, PC and Nintendo Switch.Review code provided by the publisher.The best roguelike of this generation and a bonafide Game of the Year contender, Dead Cells is simply beyond peer and utterly, utterly essential for anyone that owns a black plastic box stuffed with silicon that has 'PS4' scrawled upon it.Check the Paladins servers status.

No checkpoints. Kill, die, learn, repeat.We're huge fans of Roguelikes and Castlevaniaâ¦ So it was only natural for us to give birth to their bastard son, the Roguevania.We especially love the threat, adrenaline and that addictive feeling of having no checkpoints to save you from your screw ups. Procedural generation is also a great way to provide a fair amount of diversity, while we make sure the level design always stays fun. We're aiming to offer a different experience in each and every run and still give the world a meticulously handcrafted feel.Yet, we also wish to add our little something something to the classic recipe of a Roguelike map. Instead of the regular, rigid progression between levels, we would rather leave some room for the player to choose their path. For instance, you could reach the dungeon, by taking on either the ramparts level or the sewers. Some paths will be shorter but harder, or maybe the foes there will be more suited to your playstyle. So, it's up to you to choose your strategy and make it as far as you can.And, it won't be easy. We choose to design the combat to be quite close to what you can find in the Souls games. Every weapon has its own unique gameplay and art, bosses and monsters are pattern-based, but at least, you still get invincibility frames on your roll.

      "The stylish roguelike dungeon-crawler Dead Cells launched on PC in Early Access, and developer Motion Twin announced today that the full game will debut on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch as well. The release date has yet to be announced, though Motion Twin is hoping to roll it out before the fall.In Dead Cells, players take control of a nameless pile of green cells that possess a skeletal warrior. They hack, slice, and pierce their way through procedurally generated dungeons crawling with increasingly powerful enemies and punctuated with elite foes and boss fights. If they die, they return to the beginning, upgrade equipment that can appear during loot drops, and go at it again.“We always wanted to bring Dead cells to as much of the gaming community as possible but in all honesty, there is some form of egoism in it too,” said Motion Twin’s producer Steve Filby. “Most of us have some form of console and all of us have fond memories from ‘back in the day,’ so there’s that kind of geek dream come true vibe to it all … having our game on console, it’s a personal and professional milestone.”Dead Cells has been in Early Access since May and it’s sold over 600,000 copies. Filby says it’s been an excellent opportunity, helping the Motion Twin team tweak the mechanics and also find the “best parts of the game” and focus on those aspects.“Feedback on the balancing of the game is indeed a big part of it, but being in Early Access brings way more than that if you’re ready to listen to the community,” said Filby. “The whole metagame (the progression of the character throughout the runs) has been burnt to ashes and rebuilt to take into account suggestions from the players.”",

This is French developer Motion Twin's first 'proper' PC title, having previously focused on Flash and mobile games. That all changed in 2015, when the studio decided it was sick of working on these titles.\"When Dead Cells came about it was an idea of a spiritual successor to one of our really successful web games, Die2Nite,\" marketing and communications bod Steve Filby says.\"It was supposed to be a multiplayer online free-to-play cross-platform mobile web tower defence game. As we kept making prototypes, we just realised that we couldn't get the multiplayer to work; we just couldn't find a fun design. It looked good on paper, but when you sat down to play it didn't work.\"The head of Shiro Games, who shares our space, played the single player bit and told us we should make that as it was awesome. We tried to that and it was tower defence, but where the player could move around. We were still letting go of that mobile development and free-to-play web-based mentality. So we went: 'screw it' and made a full action-based platformer.\"But how did the mix of Metroidvania - exploration and platforming - and roguelike - procedural generation, permadeath - elements come about? Simple, sort of. Half the studio loved Metroidvanias; the other loved roguelikes.While nice and diplomatic, this raised other challenges for Motion Twin - namely that the project was quite buzzword heavy.\"When they decided to add the roguelike part in I was on holiday. I came back and they told me - I was like 'You're kidding me',\" Filby laughs.\"My job as producer is to make sure the game gets to market and that we make something that everyone is going to play. I had to take the idea and pitch it to publishers and saying: 'It's another pixel art roguelike platformer' and people are going to look at it and go: 'Well, what's new with this?'.\"It was a massive concern for us all. We were joking around and our art director came up with the term 'roguevania'. We were trying to make this kind of gameplay compelling. One of the difficulties, in the beginning, was getting the pitch into the person's hands because one of the cool things about Dead Cells is the combat. It feels nice. Getting past that initial hesitation from platform holders was a challenge. 'Okay, another roguelike game with pixel art and bits of Metroidvania' - that's just a load of buzzwords put together... that was something we had to overcome.\"In order to overcome this issue, Filby drew up a list of the top roguelikes and Metroidvania titles on Steam to give the team an indication of just how good Dead Cells had to end up being.\"When we started making these decisions, I was just following on behind saying: 'Okay, if you're going to make a roguelike game, these are the Top Ten entries in the genre on Steam - you have to be up here in the Top Three games. You want to add in Metroidvania aspects? Here are the Top Ten Metroidvania games - these are the ones you need to beat',\" he explains.\"So then we played the absolute shit out of all of those games, every single member of the team. We then sat down and looked at what those studios had done so that when we were making design decisions, we knew what we were talking about, we knew what we liked and what we did not. The big challenge was trying to come up with solutions to all the problems those games have faced over the years.\"The roguelike genre has certainly been a popular genre with indie developers, but not without its problems. Procedural generation - though potentially an efficient means of building a large game quickly - is actually pretty hard to get right. So Motion Twin opted for a balance between the randomness of algorithmic level creation and hard rules to make sure the game never felt unfair. \"\"It can go both ways when it comes to procedural generation. There's crappy procedural generation - there are games where you start up a run and you can see from the very first tile that you're screwed,\" Filby explains.\"It can be something you can't get past. We're trying to avoid these runs. That process of getting an algorithm that does that without randomness to make things interesting is long and hard. What we came up with was about 50:50 random and curated. Each chunk of a room is hand designed so that we know that certain jumps are doable, some bits are annoying but we made it that way so that's the point.\"When we moved from completely random to handmade chunks that are stitched together, we had random monster positioning. The problem was they'd come together in combinations that were just unfair. You come across enemies that are going to hit you all at once and you can't deal with them all. Once you sort all that it's very quick; but getting to that point is a long and iterative process.\"The title launched into Early Access back in May 2017. The decision to release this was was partly to do with the fact this was Motion Twin's first 'proper' PC game and - by Filby's own admission - the team were \"absolute noobs\". When it was first raised as a possible launch option, Early Access was wildly unpopular internally.\"We had a bit of an internal battle over Early Access; I wanted to do it and they were really against it,\" Filby says.\"Theirs was a kneejerk reaction about Early Access being full of crap or having a stigma. My argument was to look at what all these other games have done wrong and right in Early Access. It's about approaching the game as a professional development studio.\"We put out what we considered to be the core of the gameplay in a very polished state, missing half of the game. People respected that - they saw that it looked almost like a finished game. It wasn't finished - not even close - but people jumped on board with that. That was part of the strategy right from the beginning. The trick is to respect your community, follow through on your promises and don't oversell what you're doing. Also keep your community informed as to what you are doing.\"You can get the latest news and analysis about the business of PC games on Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin.

      "Heat Signature is an action stealth video game developed by Suspicious Developments.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nHeat Signature is an action and stealth video game played from a top-down view. Players take control a member of a group of space mercenaries who embarks on a variety of missions such as hijacking space vessels, stealing technology, assassinating crew members, rescuing captives, and more. Operating from a central base, mercenaries take on missions that require the player to fly the mercenary via a small shuttlecraft to a travelling ship, dock with it, and then infiltrate the ship and return to home base safely. The ultimate goal is to liberate the strongholds of each of the four factions in a randomly-generated nebula. The nebula serves as a tech tree, allowing the player, with each liberation, to unlock various items, such as guns, gadgets, explosives, or pods. Each station within the nebula also includes a defector mission, which are specially developed missions that, in a way, operate as different challenges for the player to attempt; as they offer no monetary gain, these missions are typically completed out of leisure or as a way to practice for standard missions. The layouts of the nebulae, the ships, their crew, and missions are procedurally generated, similar to games of the roguelike genre.Normally, the game operates in real time. At any time, the player can pause the game, which then provides a menu screen that provides additional options for the player to perform, such as switching weapons, picking up or dropping inventory items, or taking remote control of the shuttle, as well as to plan their next move, such as selecting a target for their attack. This can be done indefinitely, allowing for stunts such as picking up the weapon of a fallen enemy, equipping it, and using it against another target all while in this pause screen. Thus, the game often becomes much more about prediction and somewhat turn-based strategy rather than devising and implementing tactics in real time.\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nHeat Signature was developed by Suspicious Developments, a team led by former PC Gamer editor Tom Francis. Development took about three years starting around December 2013, and cost around GB£200,000.The game was released for Microsoft Windows on 21 September 2017. At the time of release, Francis knew that releasing the game was \"biggest risk of [his] life\", as the indie game market was saturated with titles. He had hoped to see at least half the sales that he got with Gunpoint. Within the first week, he reported that the sales of Heat Signature had exceeded those of Gunpoint, and that the game was one of the top sellers on Steam during its initial week.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHeat Signature received a favourable reception from professional critics.The game was nominated for \"Best Action Game\" at IGN's Best of 2017 Awards. It was also nominated for the \"Seumas McNally Grand Prize\" at the Independent Games Festival 2018.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
      "Heat Signature rewards as much as it punishes. It takes away chunks of your hard-earned progress after even a minor mistake, but also gives you the tools to get out of impossible situations. With the right gadgets and weapons, you can overcome, or sneak by, an army of armored soldiers with only three seconds left on the clock before your invaded ships docks and you are captured. It can be terrifying, empowering, and heartbreaking, all in a single mission. The learning curve is steep, but once you break through, you arrive somewhere in a blissful middle ground between action and strategy.In Heat Signature, you play as a collection of disposable mercenaries who take on missions with difficulty qualifiers from “easy” to “mistake.” As you complete missions, you build your bank and inventory, which consists of weapons, hacking devices, and gadgets that let you teleport around a ship, or swap positions with the bad guys. You begin each mission by jumping into your ship and flying across a vast galaxy to quietly board the ship with your goal. You can pause as often and for as long you want to strategize for each encounter. Sometimes you assassinate someone on board. Other times, you kidnap a person or steal a piece of technology. Occasionally, you must do my favorite activity: Kill everyone on board and steal the entire ship.In one mission, for example, I boarded a ship with a collection of armored guards who could not be killed with normal weapons, and I had to capture one of them. Having prepared for the mission, I brought sidewinders to instantly travel the halls, key cloners to steal their keys, and an armor-piercing gun and sword. When encountering a group of two soldiers I would stab one, pause the game, switch to my gun, take careful aim, and fire it off making sure other soldiers nearby couldn’t hear. Killing small groups, stealing keys, and bypassing the large groups got me to my target, but without a weapon to incapacitate, I had to get creative. Using my gun, I lured the armored soldier to a window and shot it out when he got near. It flung us both into space, and while a timer counted down my oxygen I remote controlled my ship to come pick us up and carry us home so I could deposit my bounty. That was a missions that went smoothly, but during the rough ones plans collapse quickly, and you will fail fast. And If you fail your mission, that character is gone – along with their accumulated money and inventory.All is not lost when you lose a character, however. As you complete missions, you are able to liberate stations, which makes certain items permanently available at the store. Having the continuous progression to grow the store was the main motivator keeping me going. Losing characters is frustrating, and it doesn’t benefit the game in a dramatic way. Starting with a new character means replaying familiar, easy missions with small rewards until you get back to a point where you can rebuy something resembling your previous inventory, and that gets repetitive.The larger goal is liberating enough stations so you take on extremely difficult missions to free the galaxy’s four strongholds. These missions are intense; in one, I ran out of ammo on the gadget that disabled enemy shields and had to resort to blowing up sections of the ship and launching enemies out of windows into space in order to dispose of them. Knocking yourself and enemies into space is intense, and retrieving yourself by remotely piloting your ship, picking yourself up right before your oxygen expires, is exhilarating.The story is offered through dialogue with a small collection of NPCs explaining the universe and its intricacies. Each of your mercenaries also has a difficult-to-complete personal mission. Sometimes it involves getting revenge, other times it might require you to save a loved one. The writing is high-quality, with small jokes littered everywhere and interesting explanations from the few realized characters, but even with the personal missions, I never felt attached to any of my mercenaries. Once I had my heart broken by losing a few, I stopped feeling compelled to read their backgrounds. It doesn’t help that visually, the tops of their heads simply aren’t interesting making them hard to identify with and connect to. By then end, I just thought of them as containers for my valuable inventory.Heat Signature’s strength lies in its ability to make you think fast when you have all the time in the world. On more than one occasion, I sat with the action paused while a countdown in the single digits spelled doom for me, and I was able to use my collection of gadgets to teleport, fight, and hack my way to a position where I could disable the alarm. Of course, it was just as often that I stumbled and was immediately shot and dumped into space by the bad guys. It frustrates as often as it makes you feel like an unstoppable genius, which is a balance worth pursuing.© 1991 to \n  document.write(new Date().getFullYear());\n Game Informer.

      "In the weeks before President-elect Iván Duque takes office in Colombia, the Brookings Institution hosted a discussion exploring the country’s current dynamics and U.S.-Colombia relations.The event featured Juan Carlos Pinzón—former Colombian minister of defense and ambassador to the United States, as well as 2017 presidential candidate in Colombia—and Brookings Senior Fellows Vanda Felbab-Brown and Michael O’Hanlon.Commenting that it’s “an exciting time to talk Colombia,” O’Hanlon described the anticipation surrounding Duque’s imminent inauguration, in addition to framing the broader scene.Duque will be Colombia’s youngest president, and he faces numerous challenges right off the bat, O’Hanlon said. Although the democratic country’s institutions have fared much better than many of its neighbors over the years, there has been trouble as well: violence among insurgent and criminal groups, increasing drug production and trafficking, a weakened economy, and instability in and refugee flows from neighboring Venezuela. Duque has also promised to make significant changes to a peace deal with the FARC.Pinzón discussed his own time on the campaign trail ahead of this summer’s presidential elections in Colombia. He called it as a wonderful opportunity to connect with the people, especially as someone who has spent his career in the policy world. Although he ran for president himself in the election, Pinzón reiterated strong backing for President-elect Duque, saying that “President Duque requires a lot of support” and that those in a position to facilitate the new administration’s efforts should do so, as it is important for the country.Felbab-Brown—an expert on nontraditional security threats, including illicit economies—has spent much time on the ground in Colombia. She said of the elections process: “One of the things that struck me about the election was actually not so much the polarization.” She went on, “in my view a healthy development was some of the coalescing of the left.” A long-term problem for Colombia has been a weak and fragmented left. Such division and weakness on one part of the political spectrum is “just not healthy for a country,” she noted. \n\n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n2018\nJul\n25\n\n\nPast Event\nAn update on Colombia\n\n9:00 AM -\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10:30 AM EDT\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington, DC\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nOrder from Chaos\nDeath by bad implementation?

The illusion of a technological fix\n\nVanda Felbab-Brown\nTuesday, July 24, 2018Broadening the topic beyond the election, O’Hanlon asked the panelists to identify the biggest challenge facing Colombia today.Pinzón called the peace process with the FARC a main obstacle ahead under Duque and the elephant in the room. During his campaign, Duque promised to “modify” (in Duque’s words) the deal, and in Pinzón’s words people who helped elect him expect him to “enhance the peace process, and enhancing the peace process has several requirements and challenges.” Pinzón detailed the main challenges: ensuring justice, following the agenda set by the people regarding drug trafficking not being considered a political crime, developing rural areas, and finding an effective counter-narcotics policy.Throughout the conversation, Pinzón reminded the audience that Colombia is not just a country afflicted with drug trafficking (a misperception that bothers many Colombians)—there are host of other issues, and moving forward, he argued, Colombia must focus on keeping the economy healthy and competitive. Social and quality of life issues are paramount, he added. For instance on pension reform, “around half of the people [of Colombia] do not get any kind of pension, or any kind of government support when they get to pension age, it’s a very delicate social issue.” Even today, when the Colombian population is relatively young, pensions are a huge portion of the budget and a key voting issue.Felbab-Brown said: “For me, the fundamental point for Colombia [was] exactly the same before the elections as it [is] after the elections. And that is whether the country will actually manage to overcome the historic exclusion and impunity, and bifurcation of the country that have really defined it.” Much as Pinzón earlier emphasized that rural development should be a critical early focus of the new administration, Felbab-Brown repeatedly stressed the problematic urban-rural divide and the latter’s development needs.She also raised concerns about the Duque administration’s likely approach to the 2016 peace accords—including their rural development aspects—which she detailed in a recent blog post. Felbab-Brown argued that a “zero coca approach” is deeply misguided, explaining that it “demands that for a community to qualify for real development, the entire region…needs to eliminate all coca. And only then will it qualify for sustained aid.” While it is not what Bogotá or Washington wants to hear, countries that have most successfully (and sustainably) reduced drug crops have “allowed some development to take place for a number of years, and only then started eradicating.” In short, she argued that drug crops cannot be effectively suppressed unless the population also gains access to legal livelihood opportunities.Pinzón said he “understands we have to confront” the illicit drug economy in Colombia, adding that the government needs to offer strong alternatives to growing coca. He also believes that eradication can be effective, and that targeting from the air can be useful. (Aerial crop spraying in Colombia has not been permitted since 2015 due to health concerns, but a return using drones is being planned.) Pinzón pointed out some oversimplifications from detractors on the matter, and described how eradication is a necessary tool in the larger battle, “especially to tackle the criminal finances.” He also argued that eradication has been successful in large parts of the country in the past, and that eradication matters because Colombia needs absolute prohibition of the crops. Beyond that, Pinzón made clear that it’s not just eradication: Rural Colombia needs roads and a state presence in general, as well as “frankly speaking, an alternative economy.”Felbab-Brown countered that forced aerial eradication, whether by drones or not, will generate the same problems as before: lack of sustainability, political opposition, and social marginalization, as she details in a recent blog post. Rather than supporting forced eradication, she said: “What Washington should be doing is engaging with Colombia into how to sustain inclusion and equitable development.” While much of that focus is on the rural parts of the country, it should also include the urban areas.Sustainable and equitable development will be a decades-long project, she added, pointing out that, for example, functioning rule of law is absent from large parts of the country. As such, she concluded that it is an “unrealistic expectation that all of this can be rolled out across the country at once.” Instead, she argued for a sequential approach “by concentrating on priority areas and gradually expanded them,” acknowledging that there will be political difficulties regarding communities that do not initially receive assistance.Pinzón tended to agree. He reiterated earlier comments, saying: “We need to focus very much on making Colombia attractive for investors, we need job creation, we need sources of income, and we need to make Colombia competitive.”Order from ChaosA how-to guide for managing the end of the post-Cold War era.

      "By\n\nKeith Griffith For Dailymail.comPublished:\n  00:39 AEST, 7 August 2018\n\n | \nUpdated:\n  04:06 AEST, 7 August 2018The Northeast will struggle under humidity that makes it feels like triple-digit temperatures early this week, as blazing heat and dry conditions in the West fuel 62 separate wildfires - including the massive Mendocino Complex Fire in California.Parts of the Northeast, including Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, are under a heat advisory through Tuesday, with temperatures in the high 90s and humidity combining for heat indexes over 100 in some areas.'Strong southerly flow will pump hot and humid air into the Northeast, resulting in above normal temperatures and even higher index values,' the National Weather Service said in a flash bulletin. 'In the meantime, several areas in the Northeast also have poor air quality.'Meanwhile out West, a critical Red Flag Warning is in effect for parts of southern California through Tuesday, meaning conditions are ripe for new wildfires as crews continue to battle massive blazes across the state.'Gusty north winds will develop across the region, strongest across the Santa Barbara county south coast and mountains, as well as the Interstate 5 corridor of the Los Angeles and Ventura county mountains into the Santa Clarita Valley,' the NWS said.'Any new fire ignitions will have the potential for very rapid fire spread and extreme fire behavior,' the bulletin continued.On Monday morning, about 120 miles north of San Francisco, the Mendocino Complex Fire officially became the second-largest wildfire in modern state history, reaching 427 square miles. It is now just 13 square miles away from surpassing the state's largest fire, the Thomas Fire last year in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.Crews worked through the night to hold the fire lines, and the fire was 30 per cent contained Monday morning, CalFire said.The Mendocino Complex has destroyed 75 homes and 68 other structures, officials said. The fire began on July 27 and the cause remains under investigation.More than 20,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate their homes as the fire tears through communities in Mendocino, Lake and Colusa counties.Smaller but far more destructive than the Mendocino Complex, the Carr Fire continues to rage about 160 miles north of Sacramento. It is now 250 square miles.On Saturday, the death toll from the Carr Fire rose to seven, claiming the life of an apprentice power company lineman, 21-year-old Jairus Ayeta, a native of Kampala, Uganda.The Pacific Gas & Electric Co. employee was doing restoration work in Shasta County when he suffered a fatal accident, the company said.On a GoFundMe page established to raise money for Ayeta's family, coworkers described him as an upbeat worker with a strong work ethic. 'Jay was one of the best apprentices I've seen and instantly liked among our crews, great hand. Gonna miss you buddy,' one coworker, Dustin Baker, wrote.The Carr Fire had already taken the lives of a firefighter, a bulldozer operator, and four civilians.The fire has destroyed 1,080 homes along with 524 other structures. CalFire said late Sunday that the fire was 43 per cent contained.The Carr Fire began on July 23 and was caused by sparks from the rim of a flat tire on a towed trailer, officials said.On Sunday, President Donald Trump declared a 'major disaster' in California, ordering additional federal funding to be made available to help recovery effortsTrump had previously declared a state of emergency on July 28, freeing up federal funds to assist California.The new 'major disaster' declaration would help fire victims with unemployment assistance, food aid and legal and mental health counseling among other federal programs, and would also make counties and cities eligible for federal financial assistance and help with repairing the billions of dollars of damage done to infrastructure.Trump also tweeted about the fires on Sunday night: 'California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!'The President added in a Monday tweet: 'Governor Jerry Brown must allow the Free Flow of the vast amounts of water coming from the North and foolishly being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Can be used for fires, farming and everything else. Think of California with plenty of Water - Nice! Fast Federal govt. approvals.'It is unclear exactly what water management policy Trump was referring to in the tweets, and officials in California haven't complained of a lack of water available to firefighters.In September, Trump's Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke did order land managers at federal parks to begin aggressively clearing underbrush to prevent wildfires from spreading.In addition to California, there are current active large fire incidents in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Nevad, Utah, Colorado and Texas.The New York City skyline shimmers in the humidity on Monday, when the heat index is forecast to approach 100A map shows areas in the Northeast that are under a National Weather Service heat advisory through TuesdayThe three-day forecast highs for the Northeast are seen above.

      "By\nSteven Messner\n2017-09-21T20:30:47.263ZReviewBy making excellent use of its procedurally generated world and wacky gadgets, Heat Signature is a mission worth taking.I smashed an unsuspecting guard so hard with a Concussion Hammer that his body went sliding down the corridor, comically coming to a stop at the feet of four of his peers. Oops, I thought. As the four other guards immediately began shouting and attacking, the spaceship's captain changed course for a safe station just 30 seconds away. I hadn't even gone more than four rooms without bungling the mission, and now I had just half a minute to salvage it before my character was captured. I never expected being my time as a space-faring rogue in Heat Signature would be so full of hilarious, little surprises.Fortunately, the captain was only a few rooms away. I could get to him easily—assuming nothing else went wrong. Using my Sidewinder, I teleported into the middle of the group of guards. They turned to me and opened fire. I paused, switched gadgets to my Emergency Shield, and activated it. In the split second between their bullets leaving their guns and hitting me, the shield switched on and deflected the rounds back at them. It was a bloodbath. Then, using my Long Range Key Cloner, I nabbed the passkey I needed from a guard several rooms away and entered the bridge. The mission was saved.I've lost count of how many of these moments I've experienced. Moments when my carefully laid plan crumbles to dust and I'm forced to make use of the pause feature to survey the situation and find some new path forward. Heat Signature is a wonderful procedurally-generated playground for those who love to experiment, fail, and adapt.Though it kind of looks like Hotline Miami, Heat Signature shares more DNA with Dishonored 2 except set in a procedurally generated sandbox galaxy. If that sounds ambitious for a game built in GameMaker, well, it is. At any time, even during a mission, other ships are zooming from station to station. During one mission, another ship attacked the one I was infiltrating, turning a stealthy theft into a frantic race to get the item and get out before a missile wiped me out.There is no real overarching narrative to Heat Signature—not one that I was bothered to care about, anyway. There's four big empires that rule the galaxy and you're part of a group of revolutionaries trying to overthrow them. To do this, you infiltrate their ships and murder, kidnap, and steal. There are some characters and story there to try and spice it up, but none of it was engaging enough to make me interested. The fun is solely found in unlocking new gadgets and testing my mettle by tackling progressively deadlier missions.There are plenty of unique ideas in Heat Signature. For one, you don't play as a single character but a revolving door of randomly generated mercenaries. When one dies or is captured, you're forced to pick a new recruit. Each of these characters has their own personal score to settle against one of the empires in the form of a personal mission, but their collective efforts also help convince nearby space stations to abandon their empire and join your cause. Doing so unlocks new gadgets to be bought with your earnings from completing missions. That the map is also a tech tree is one of Heat Signature's best ideas. Each empire has its own unique gadgets, like the Glitchers using teleporters, so I had to focus on what tech I wanted to unlock first as the expense of other options.When I first started playing, I stuck to easy missions to board ships that had only a few poorly equipped guards. I'd set out from my station in my 'pod,' a specialized ship that attaches to the airlocks of bigger vessels like a tick, and be back home in only a minute or two. Even with just a wrench, it was easy to make my way through the randomly generated corridors, knocking out guards en route to my objective.But, now nearing 20 hours of playtime, Heat Signature's challenge is daunting. Guards come equipped with shields and armor and cluster together in groups. Sometimes they'll explode upon death or can immediately teleport to suspicious noises. Sentry guns lock down entire corridors and special mission modifiers might reward me with extra pay if I adhere to restrictions like not raising any alarms or leaving any witnesses alive.It's when Heat Signature is the most difficult that it often spawns the best anecdotes. Like Spelunky, sometimes a simple interaction can have surprising consequences. One time I fired a grenade into a group of guards and when it exploded, it caused one of their guns to ricochet off a wall and accidentally discharge. The bullet whizzed into the adjacent room I was in and struck the fuel cell behind me. This all happened in the span of a second and I only noticed what went wrong because the fuel cell was glowing. I didn't have enough time to run from the impending explosion so I turned on my Emergency Shield to survive the blast but promptly found myself sucked out into space as the whole room exploded.I really enjoy that, in service of fun and experimentation, Heat Signature is quite forgiving. Getting hit once knocks you unconscious, but guards always toss you out of the airlock rather than finish you off. That gives you a moment to remote control your pod and scoop your body back up to try again—albeit with less time should you be injured again. But once you finally die, you and your gear are gone for good, and you have to continue the game with a new character.If you're captured, new recruits will often spawn with a personal mission to rescue you, letting you continue playing as the captured character. There's even a cool feature where your characters might appear in your Steam friends' games for them to rescue and play with.But rarely is being killed or captured an unexpected consequence. In the heat of action—or when things have gone wrong—I can always pause and plan my next step. Fights in Heat Signature have this pleasing stop-go pacing of split second action followed by seconds of careful consideration. This minute focus is very satisfying. I'd smack a guard with a wrench, pause, switch to a gun, shoot another, pause, teleport behind a third guard, pause, and lay a Glitch Trap at his feet that would teleport him to the cold vacuum outside the hull of the ship, leaving him to suffocate as his oxygen ran out. Despite that, I do wish the enemy AI was more challenging. They always patrol and move predictably and sometimes it was either to undermine a difficult mission just by picking them off one by one while on patrol.Despite the boring AI, Heat Signature's missions and pausable combat are enjoyable because of the dizzying variety of tools you can use. Sure, storming a ship with only a wrench is fun once or twice, but I love using Subverters to turn my enemies' shields against them so that bullets are deflected on the inside instead of the outside. Seeing a guard murdered by his own shotgun blast as it ricochets inside his shield is hilarious.Teleporters are another great gadget that I frequently make use of. Swappers can let me switch places with a guard while Visitors let me jump to one room for two seconds before snapping back. You can get pretty creative with these tools as well, like the time I used a Visitor to teleport outside the hull of a ship and then a Swapper to switch places with my assassination target.Stealth shields, electronics-disabling Crash Beams, room-destroying breach charges—the list goes on and on. Any of these items can be found in loot boxes on a ship, but once you unlock the appropriate station they'll always be available for purchase. Different stations might also unlock variants with more uses, longer reach, or rechargeable ammo. And because the galaxy is randomly generated, what gear you'll have access to first is also random.My only major complaint is that Heat Signature obviously pushes the limits of GameMaker. Slowdowns happen every so often and I experienced several crashes to desktop. Because missions are usually only a few minutes long, I never felt like I lost too much progress. It's still frustrating, though.And while I do enjoy the cycle of liberating stations to unlock more gear, it did begin to feel like a grind with no real endgame to look forward to. Once you start to unlock the most powerful gadgets, the intimidating threat that some missions initially pose erodes, and the thrill begins to die. Each liberated station offers Defector Missions which add a fun challenge by restricting what gadgets you can use. They're a great way to learn creative combos I hadn't thought of, like how to kill a room full of guards using only an Emergency Shield. But they ultimately feel like a distraction from a core campaign that struggles to entice after 15 hours.Still, those 15 hours are a great time. Heat Signature inspires creativity through emergent complexity like any great immersive sim. I can't stop regaling friends with my stories of heists gone bad or boasting about my flashes of brilliance in the heat of the moment. Heat Signature is brilliant at teasing these anecdotal threads out of a procedural universe.Disclosure: Heat Signature creator Tom Francis was an editor at PC Gamer for 10 years, leaving in 2013 after the release of his first game, Gunpoint.

      "This interview is part of our Road to the IGF series. You can find the rest by clicking here.Randomly-generated starships await to be raided in Suspicious Developments' Heat Signature, a game of dealing with all of the things that can go wrong while doing so. Security guards, futuristic gadgets, and ships blown to pieces can all make for challenging situations to deal with, and the player just has to make do with the hand they're dealt.Gamasutra spoke with Tom Francis of Suspicious Developments to learn about the nuances of creating stressful situations that can pop up for players to deal with, and how having consistent logic helped create some neat potential solutions in the Seamus McNally Grand Prize-nominated title.I used to be a games critic for PC Gamer for 9 years. For the last 3 of those, I started tinkering with Game Maker in my spare time, and made Gunpoint with artist John Roberts, composer Ryan Ike, and 3 others. That sold well enough for me to make indie games full time, and Heat Signature is the first big game I've designed since then.It started with an interview like this, with me on the other side - I was asking Spelunky creator Derek Yu if he thought his chunky level generation could be adapted to 3D. Afterwards, I thought about how I'd approach that, and thought of spaceships as a good type of level where you could destroy any part of it and it'd make sense that there's nothing outside. It was just a pipe dream, I wasn't even a developer at the time, but after Gunpoint I realized I knew enough to make a game like that in 2D. So it sort of came full circle.We used Game Maker Studio 1.4. It's still the fastest tool I know to get something up and working, and I was surprised it let us do things like the seamless galactic zoom without too much hassle.I started it alone in December 2013. Around August 2014, I had enough of the game working that I put out a call for artists and composers, and not coincidentally John Roberts was the best choice for art again. For music I hired John Halpart for the main score, and Christopher James Harvey for a few extra tracks.At the start of 2017 it had been 3 years, and I was itching to finish, so I hired John Winder to help me with the programming side of things. Valve had invited me to co-work from their offices, and John's technical skills plus our chats with Valve led to features like finding your Steam Friends' items in-game.We finally released in September 2017, so 3 years, 9 months. Never again.I think most of it comes from creating rules of the simulation, rather than special cases with a particular intent. So, when you fire a gun, we have that create a noise in a certain radius, and guards investigate suspicious noises. I didn't add that to create a specific scenario, or even to make the game harder or easier. It's just a rule that makes sense, is easy to learn, and applies in all situations.That means it can be a tool: fire to trick a guard into opening a door when he comes to investigate. Or a problem: you can dodge this guard's bullet, but the noise of him firing is going to attract everyone else. Same goes for other rules, like 'a heavy, fast moving object hitting someone will knock them out'. You can throw a concussion hammer at a guard across the room, but equally a grenade that takes out an engineer can send his wrench flying at you hard enough to knock you out cold.I usually find if you make a consistent logical simulation, players create their own catastrophes.The hard work is in building the simulation, and the payoff is that it's then really easy to invent and add cool items. For two and a half years I was mostly just doing the first part, lots of simulation work with only a few boring items like guns. Then, in the last year, I was able to add a flurry of fun gadgets almost as fast as I thought of them.So the Slipstream, a device that slows time and lets you move 5x faster than everyone else, only took a couple of hours to add. We already had variable time-scale, the physics of bullets and movement were already timescale-dependent, so it's just a few lines of code to change that number, and make an exception for the player.Now you can outrun a bullet, and all these other unforeseen consequences happen for free - for example, you can just run through glass. A ship's window is just checking \"OK, we just got hit by heavy object travelling at 20 metres per second, time to break.\" So that trick just works because the physics of it adds up. I didn't even know you could do it until after launch.That was a very happy accident. I do generally want to avoid making my games too skill-based, not least because I'm bad at skill-based games myself, but I hadn't really managed that in Heat Signature until I came to add an inventory screen.This was just to help you change weapons without fumbling for the right key in a tricky situation, and initially it blacked out the whole screen while you picked a weapon. Then I tried only dimming the game world behind the menu, then I tried not dimming it at all, then I tried moving the inventory list out of the way to the side, then I tried letting you aim shots directly from this screen, and suddenly I had more of a strategy game than an action game.I discovered this is a huge win for an open-ended, emergent type game. These games, Heat Signature included, generally allow for loads more interesting solutions than the player has time to consider in the time window when they'd work. A pause-and-play system completely removes that limit, and suddenly the frequency of those story-worthy \"Aha!\" moments exploded.To be honest, this feature was probably a mistake. I think it works as a nice 'last resort' or 'exceptional circumstances' solution, but it was so insanely expensive to make that it probably wasn't worth it. The number of bugs and crashes and extra code complexity in other features that came from the fact that any given part of a ship might just stop existing, that a ship might split into three different ships, was crazy.So, to your question, what it adds to the challenge is fairly minimal, but I think it does add to the fantasy: knowing you *can* hijack a ship and have a space battle in it and blow a piece off and then board that piece. That probably adds more to the excitement of being in this world than it does to the mechanically interesting solutions available to you.I've been playing Into the Breach for a year now, and it's fantastic, even better than FTL. I think I've put in over 100 hours. Would be very happy to lose to that!Visibility is the one we all talk about these days. I think that's sometimes seen as \"How to market my game\" but I don't think that's the hard bit. The hard bit is making something that's more worthy of attention than the other 200 games that came out that week. That bar is rising, and if you don't pass it then the marketing part is impossible. If you do, marketing is still a thing you've gotta put work and thought into, but it's nothing like as hard as passing that bar in the first place.Everyone worries: what if my good game gets drowned out by all the trash that can get on Steam now? But overall sales are up, and it's not the trash they're buying. So, the scarier scenario is: what if my good game gets drowned out by games people like more?",

      "Middle EastSuspicious Developments Reveals Heat SignatureThe Kickstarter campaign for Ouya title Gridiron Thunder has aroused suspicions this week after it managed to reach its $75,000 goal with a very low number of backers.Gridiron Thunder is, put simply, a pro football game designed for Ouya, Facebook, and iOS and Android devices. At launch, it will be available exclusively on Ouya for six months. This is in order to take advantage of Ouya's Free the Games Fund, an initiative that will double the money (up to $250,000) raised by any Kickstarter game campaign, so long as it pledges six months of exclusivity to Ouya and raises at least $50,000.Along with Elementary, My Dear Holmes!, Gridiron Thunder is one of the first two games to meet its crowdfunding goal and the fund's requirements. Having surpassed its Kickstarter goal of $75,000, Gridiron developer MogoTXT will see upwards of $78,000 from Ouya, and possibly much more as the campaign runs through September 8.Where this all begins to become suspicious is with the identity of Gridiron's backers, of which there are not many. Some people are alleging that many of the project's backers have been fabricated in an attempt to squeeze money out of Ouya.As of this writing, the campaign has raised $78,340 from 137 backers. That's just under an astounding $572 pledged by each backer -- and that's a sharp decline from earlier in the campaign, when the average pledge was $626 per person. For comparison's sake, the average pledge per backer for Double Fine's adventure game, Project Eternity, and Wasteland 2 -- some of the most highly funded video game Kickstarter campaigns to date -- was $38, $54, and $48, respectively. Even Ouya itself, which required pledges of at least $95 in order for backers to receive an Ouya console, saw an average of only $136 per person.Peculiar as these numbers might be, they prove nothing. Adding further fuel to the fire is the fact that many of the backers used newly created profiles on Kickstarter. As noted on NeoGAF, among these are different profiles that have the same name as each another, and some which share the same last name as MogoTXT CEO Andrew Won. And, despite the large amount donated by backers, very few of the higher donation tiers have been chosen, meaning these individuals decided to pass up the rewards they were entitled to.There's also the atypical pattern at which donations came in at, as shown on Kicktraq, which looks a great deal unlike most other successful Kickstarters. However, it's possible that could be explained by the low number of backers, which is different from anything we've seen before from a campaign that has raised this much money.Ouya's response to all of this has been one of support. Asked on Twitter if it would be looking into the matter, Ouya responded, \"We're thrilled to see Gridiron qualify for the FTG fund & hopefully they'll bring their supportive community with them to OUYA!\" It offered a similar sentiment in a statement shared with Joystiq. It stated, \"[B]ased on our program's guidelines, the team behind Gridiron Thunder have successfully qualified to receive the match and we couldn't be more excited to see them bring their game along with their supportive community to Ouya.\"As for MogoTXT's position on all of this, CEO Andrew Won has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement issued to Gamasutra, which the site pointed out dealt more with questions it hadn't asked than those it had, Won said, \"We are not trying to do something improper with Ouya's Free the Games promotion, and we are in full compliance with both KickStarter's and Ouya's rules.\"Won attempted to explain the amounts donated by backers by saying, \"We have had some generous donors but so have other KickStarter campaigns. In our case, we have very deep roots in Silicon Valley and great ties to fellow tech entrepreneurs in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond. We also have friends in the professional sports world who want to see us succeed. I don't think there is anything wrong with having generous supporters, and we make no apology for this. It does not violate any KickStarter or Ouya rule.\"He also dismissed questions of whether or not MogoTXT had the rights to release a football game that features the likenesses of present-day NFL players. \"Some people, who are not lawyers and who have no knowledge of the facts, also said that we lack the intellectual property rights to build our game. They have no idea what they are talking about,\" he said.Ouya has informed the Penny Arcade Report that the Free the Games Fund will only match 25% of the total raised through Kickstarter at first. The remaining 75% will not be handed over until the game has been released. In other words, should Gridiron Thunder turn out be a scam, as many people suspect, MogoTXT would not receive the bulk of the money it's now entitled to unless it releases a game on Ouya.As of yet, there has been no definitive evidence presented to suggest Gridiron Thunder is not what MogoTXT claims it to be. Ouya has given no indication that it plans to exclude the game from its development initiative, nor has Kickstarter publicly called the campaign's legitimacy into question.Do you think it's unfair to raise an eyebrow at the game based on this evidence, or are gamers right to do so considering it's the public's money that backs games on Kickstarter? Let us know in the comments."

      "Interview By Chad ZimmermanBrian Roberts had a breakout season in 2005 with the Baltimore Orioles. Besting his previous career-high batting average by 50 points, Roberts hit .314 and belted 18 homerssix more than in his previous four seasons combined. Earning his first trip to the All-Star Game, Roberts and teammate Miguel Tejada became only the third middle infield duo in league history to start in the same game.Roberts was the top-rated defensive player out of college, but it took some time for him to reach his full potential in the big show. And now, he is more than willing to share his experiences, expertise and some of his favorites.ExperiencesSTACK: How do you explain your great success last season? Roberts: It's a combination of many factors. Everybody matures and grows into the kind of player they're supposed to be at different times. For me, it took a couple years in the league to get comfortable and to understand my job and role. When we traded Jerry Hairston who also played secondto the Cubs for Sammy [Sosa], it freed up my mind and opened it to the possibility that I would be playing every day. Even if I went 0-4, I'd still be in the lineup the next day. My workout program and training at Athletes' Performance for the past four years has also made a huge difference.STACK: What was the hardest part about adjusting to the pro game? Roberts: There are two steps to getting into pro baseball. The first is the jump from college to the minor leagues, which are two completely different lifestyles. In the minors, you play with a wood bat instead of a metal one, you play more games, you travel a lot more and you have more freedom.Then there's the jump from the minors to the big leagues, which brings another set of huge changes. Now you deal with playing in front of more people, more demands on your time and more travelall things to which you have to adjust. Sometimes it takes awhile to get comfortable.STACK: What was difficult about playing in front of more people? Roberts: I think at first you're afraid of failing in front of that many people. But you conquer those fears once you realize you're playing the same game you've always played.Now I don't really think about the crowd. Actually, I can't imagine not playing in front of them. We're disappointed when the crowd is small. So once you get adjusted to the bigger crowd, you start to feel the adrenaline.STACK: Tell us about your on-field chemistry with Miguel Tejada. Roberts: You can't build it; it develops over time through playing together. The first year was a learning process for both of us. Then last year we were both very comfortable with what each other did, our ranges, where we like the ball given to us to turn double plays. You learn these things over time.STACK: What is it like playing with Tejada? Roberts: He's so laid back and has fun no matter what, which has helped me, because I'm more of a serious person on the field. When a batter hits the ball up the middle or we're losing, he talks to me, keeps me up. He's fun to play with, which is great because the season is so long.STACK: Was it difficult building camaraderie with the guys on the team? Roberts: Any time you are on a new team, the first year is a learning and feeling-out process of your teammates, the organization and the city. Over time, though, you develop friendships and become more relaxed around the guys. Your team is your family when you're on the road 81 days of the year. People are always going out, getting something to eat and hanging out. They are the people you trust. It just takes time to get used to playing with a new team.STACK: What's the funniest thing you've witnessed while playing in the Majors? Roberts: One thing everybody looks forward to is dressing the rookies up at the end of the season. They have to fly on the plane in ridiculous costumes. Grown men in dresses are pretty funny.STACK: What did you have to wear? Roberts: I had to wear a Hooters uniform in New York Citynot one of my finer moments, but definitely funny. These types of things make professional sports more fun. We're grown men who get to act like kids and get away with it.STACK: What's the funniest thing you've seen in the dugout? Roberts: The funniest stuff was in the minors. Stupid stuff like putting bubble gum on the bottom of a cup and sticking it on someone's hat. Guys would run out of the dugout and have no idea. Then they'd be in the middle of the field with a cup on their head.ExpertiseSTACK: What do you do after you commit an error? Roberts: You have to shake off an error no matter what. The best thing is just to say, 'Okay, I'm gonna get the next ground ball hit to me, make a play, and we'll turn two and be out of it.' You can't think negatively, but instead, 'Hit me another one and I'll make the play.' That's something you have to do in baseball. You're going to fail seven out of 10 times at bat, and you're going to make errors. It's the nature of the game, so you have to stay positive.STACK: When you're in a hitting slump, what can you do to get out of it? Roberts: When you're in a slump, wasting at-bats is one of the worst mistakesswinging at bad pitches and trying too hard. I've learned to relax and have good at-bats every time I'm in the box. When you do that, you eventually come out of the slump.I've also learned to not beat myself up as much as I used to. Over the course of the season, you have hot streaks and cold streaks. But you have to stay positive. They call it a batting average because it's an overall look at where you are. You don't base it off 30 at-bats. You take the whole season and grind it out.STACK: What advice do you have for high school athletes? Roberts: When I was in high school, I took the games too seriously and was too hard on myself sometimes. You have to enjoy playing, because your career comes and goes so fast. You want to look back and realize that you enjoyed your time playing and that you didn't put too much pressure on yourself. It's supposed to be fun. Sometimes we forget that when we're playing.But if baseball is what you want to do and what you want be good at, you have to out-work the person beside you. There's always someone out there who wants the same thing you do. So you have to put in time off the field, practicing and working out, to become as good as you can. But when you get into the game, remember to have fun.FavoritesPre-Game Music: Dave Matthews, Ben Harper, Christian rock Roberts: I like calmer music. I don't like to listen to a lot of heavy metal. I like to relax instead of get energized, and something mellow calms me down.Pre-Game Food:  Burrito Roberts: All baseball players are pretty superstitious, and I'm no different. Early in the season, our team was playing really well. So I had a burrito from the same place before every home game for about the first month of the season. It's not necessarily my favorite food, but it was when we were winning.Superstition:  The spikes Roberts: I'm most superstitious when I'm playing well. I wear the same spikes when things are good, and I change them when they're not. More than anything though, I find a routine I can follow before games. I put on my uniform the same way, go to the training room, then get loose. I do things more out of habit than anything.Sports Movie:  Bull Durham Roberts: I grew up in Chapel Hill (N.C.), right across the street from where the movie took place. I remember when they were filming it when I was younger. That was one of my favorite movies then and still is today.Photo Credit: Getty Images // ThinkstockTopics: \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMOTIVATION\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t | \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBASEBALLJoin STACK and gain instant FREE access to resources that have helped millions of people jump higher, run faster, get stronger, eat smarter and play better.See MoreSTACK ResourcesSTACK PartnersSTACKFollow STACK",

Dialogue of cultures 1Cultures vary not only from nation to nation but also from century to century. How do we learn about early cultures? — Культуры различаются не только от народа к народу, но и от века к веку. Как мы узнаем о древних культурах?\nEx.1 Read the text and answer the following questions: — Прочитайте текст и ответьте на следующие вопросы:\n• What science helps us to learn about early cultures? – Какая наука помогает нам узнать о ранних культурах?\n• Why is it called that? — Почему она так называется?\n• What is an artifact? — Что такое артефакт?\n• What is the main question modern archaeologists are interested in? – Каким главным вопросом интересуются современные археологи?\n\nArchaeology helps us\nArchaeology is the scientific study of the material remains of mankind’s past.\nThe word archaeology is derived from two Greek words — archaios, meaning ‘ancient’, and logia, meaning ‘science’ or ‘study of’.\nArchaeology studies both the things made by people and the things used by them. All the things made by people (settlements, buildings, tools, weapons, ornamental objects, and clothes) are called artifacts.\nOriginally archaeologists were interested in studying ancient things. Later, archaeologists became interested in societies, religions, and economies of past cultures. Modern archaeology wants to understand not only how cultures change, but also why they change.Археология помогает нам \nАрхеология — научное исследование материальных останков прошлого человечества.\nСлово «археология» происходит от двух греческих слов — archaios, что означает «древний», и — logia, что означает «наука» или «изучение».\nАрхеология изучает как вещи, сделанные людьми, так и вещи, используемые ими. Все вещи, сделанные людьми (поселения, здания, инструменты, оружие, декоративные предметы и одежда), называются артефактами.\nПервоначально археологи были заинтересованы в изучении древних вещей. Позже археологи заинтересовались обществами, религиями и экономиками культур прошлого. Современная археология хочет понять не только, как меняются культуры, но и почему они меняются.Ex. 3 Quickly read the text and give a Russian title to it. – Быстро прочитайте текст и дайте ему русский заголовок.\nRussian birch bark writings\nOne of the greatest archeological sensations of the 20th century was the discovery of birch bark documents in Novgorod in 1951. Later, more than 1,000 similar documents were discovered in Staraya Russa, Smolensk, Torzhok, Pskov, Tver, Moscow and Ryazan.\nMost documents are ordinary letters by different people. They tell us about everyday life in those times. They also show that many people in old Russia knew how to read and write. This discovery changed traditional ideas about the education and culture of Russians in the 11th-15th centuries.\nOne of the most interesting birch bark documents is a kind of pupil’s ‘Activity Book’. It is a spelling lesson and some drawings made by a boy named Onfim. He was probably 6 or 7 at the time.Российские берестяные письма\nОдной из величайших археологических сенсаций 20-го века было открытие берестяных документов в Новгороде в 1951 году. Позже, более 1000 подобных документов были обнаружены в Старой Руссе, Смоленске, Торжке, Твери, Пскове, Москве и Рязани.\nБольшинство документов — простые письма различным людям. Они рассказывают нам о повседневной жизни в те времена. Они также показывают, что многие люди в старой России умели читать и писать. Это открытие изменило традиционные представления об образовании и культуре россиян в 11-15 вв.\nОдним из самых интересных берестяных документов является своего рода ученическая тетрадь. Это урок правописания и рисунки, сделанные мальчиком по имени Онфим. Ему, вероятно, было 6 или 7 лет в то время.Dialogue of cultures 2\nEx. 1 Do the quiz with your friend and then discuss difficult questions with the class. – Ответьте на вопросы со своим другом и затем обсудите трудные вопросы с классом.\nDiscovering Australia – Открытие Австралии\nThe sea explorers from Europe called this land ‘terra australis’. Terra means ‘land’ in Latin but what is the meaning of australis? — Морские исследователи из Европы назвали эту землю «Южная земля». Терра означает «земля» на латинском языке, но что значит австралис?\na) different — отличающийся\nb) southern — южный\nc) wonderful — замечательный2 Australia is a country and it is a continent.

Its white curved roof looks like the sails of a ship sailing in the waters of Sydney Harbour.\nThe building was designed by the Danish architect John Utzon. The construction began in 1957 and was finished 16 years later. The actual cost was 14 times more than originally planned. A series of Opera House lotteries was organised to raise extra money.Вы знали, какое здание выглядит как парусный корабль?\nОдним из архитектурных шедевров современного мира является Сиднейский оперный театр. Его белая изогнутая крыша выглядит как паруса корабля, плывущего в водах гавани Сиднея.\nЗдание было спроектировано датским архитектором Джоном Утзон. Строительство началось в 1957 году, и было закончено 16 лет спустя. Фактическая стоимость была в 14 раз больше, чем первоначально планировалось. Была организована серия лотерей Оперы, чтобы получить дополнительные деньги.Did you know what words were borrowed by Russian and English from Australian native languages?\nLinguists say that the word ‘kangaroo’ came into English as early as 1770 at the time of the first expedition of Captain Cook. ‘Boomerang’ was borrowed later — about 1830. Both words came into Russian directly from Australian native languages due to the expeditions of Miklouho-Maclay, a famous Russian explorer. Miklouho-Maclay was also a naturalist and an ethnographer. His exploits made him something of a legend during his lifetime.Вы знали, какие слова были заимствованы русским и английским языками из родного языка Австралийцев?\nЛингвисты говорят, что слово «кенгуру» пришло в английский язык еще в 1770 году во время первой экспедиции капитана Кука. «Бумеранг» было заимствовано позже — около 1830. Оба слова пришли в русский язык непосредственно из австралийского родного языка в связи с экспедициями Миклухо-Маклая, известного российского исследователя. Миклухо-Маклай был также натуралистом и этнографом. Его подвиги сделали его чем-то вроде легенды при жизни.DIALOGUE OF CULTURES (3)\nDiscovering Ireland – Исследуем Ирландию\nEx. 1 Do the quiz with your friend and then discuss difficult questions with the class. — Выполните викторину со своим другом, а затем обсудите сложные вопросы с классом.\nA\n1 Ireland is politically divided into the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. — Ирландия политически разделена на Ирландскую Республику и Северную Ирландию.\na) true — правда\nb) false – ложь2 Republic of Ireland is an independent state. — Ирландия является независимым государством.\na) true — правда\nb) false -ложь3 Northern Ireland is a part of the UK. — Северная Ирландия является частью Великобритании.\na) true — правда\nb) false -ложьВ\n1 Ireland is… – Ирландия является\na) the largest island in the world. – самым большим островом в мире\nb) the 2nd largest. – второй по величине\nc) the 3rd largest. – третий по величине2 What is the capital of the Republic of Ireland?

In the 5th century he brought Christianity to Ireland. St Patrick’s Day, March 17, has always had a special meaning for the Irish, wherever they live. In Ireland this is a national holiday with parades held all over the country. People of Irish origin come from all over the USA, Canada, Britain and continental Europe to join in the celebration. The biggest parade takes place in Dublin. Participants and spectators wear green ribbons and shamrocks. According to the legend, St Patrick used the shamrock, a plant with three leaves, to explain the Holy Trinity to the Irish. Green is now considered the national colour of Ireland.\nSt Patrick’s Day is celebrated in some other countries as well. New York claims the world’s oldest St Patrick’s Day parade, first held in 1762. Boston, the most Irish of American cities, has held these parades since 1802. Chicago is famous for dying the city’s river green as part of the celebrations. In 1992 St Patrick’s Day was first celebrated in Moscow. Thousands of excited Muscovites gathered on Novy Arbat to watch the parade of marching bands, Cossack horsemen and floats representing many Russian and Irish companies. Since then St Patrick’s Day has been traditionally celebrated in Moscow.Знаете ли вы, о фестивале в День Святого Патрика?\nСвятой Патрик является покровителем Ирландии и Северной Ирландии. В 5-м веке он принес христианство в Ирландию. День Святого Патрика, 17 марта, всегда имел особое значение для ирландцев, где бы они не жили. В Ирландии это национальный праздник с парадами, проводимыми по всей стране. Люди ирландского происхождения приезжают со всего США, Канады, Великобритании и континентальной Европы, чтобы присоединиться к празднованию. Самый большой парад проходит в Дублине. Участники и зрители надевают зеленые ленточки и трилистники. По преданию, святой Патрик использовал трилистник, растение с тремя листьями, чтобы объяснить Святую Троицу ирландцам. Зеленый теперь считается национальным цветом Ирландии.\nДень Святого Патрика отмечается в некоторых других странах. Нью-Йорк претендует на старейший в мире парад в честь Дня Святого Патрика, первый из которых, состоялся в 1762. Бостон, самый ирландский из американских городов, проводит эти парады с 1802 года. Чикаго славится окрашиванием рек в зеленый цвет в рамках празднования. В 1992 году День Святого Патрика впервые отмечался в Москве. Тысячи взволнованных москвичей собрались на Новом Арбате, чтобы посмотреть парад оркестров, казачьих наездников и поплавков, представляющих многие российские и ирландские компании. С тех пор День Святого Патрика традиционно отмечается в Москве.DIALOGUE OF CULTURES (4)\nEx. 1 Do the quiz with your friend, then discuss difficult questions with the class. — Выполните викторину со своим другом, а затем обсудите сложные вопросы с классом.Discovering Italy – Открытие Италии\n1 Which of these countries is next to Italy? – Какая из этих стран находится рядом с Италией?\na) France — Франция\nb) Austria — Австрия\nc) Slovenia — Словения\nd) Switzerland — Швейцария2 What are the colours of the Italian flag? – Цвета итальянского флага?\na) green, white and red — зеленый, белый и красный\nb) red, white and blue — красный, белый и синий\nc) black, red and yellow — черный, красный и желтый3 What is the capital of Italy?

Italian explorers Christopher Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci discovered the Americas, and another Italian merchant traveller, Marco Polo, was one of the first Europeans to explore the East.\nLeonardo da Vinci was an artist and an inventor. His journals include a great number of inventions, both practical and impractical: musical instruments, flying machines, war machines and a submarine.\nAlessandro Volta studied electricity and gave his name ‘Volt’ to a unit of electricity. Italians also invented many musical instruments, including the piano.\nAnother Italian invention that has conquered the world is pizza. There is a legend about how Margherita pizza got its name.\nIn 1889 the Italian King Umberto I and Queen Margherita decided to make a visit to Naples. The most famous pizza-maker in Naples, Raffaele Esposito, baked three pizzas for the Queen in the palace kitchen. The Queen preferred the pizza in the colours of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil) and white (mozzarella). This kind of pizza was then named after the Queen as Margherita pizza.Знаете ли вы, чем известны итальянцы?\nИтальянцы славятся не только своими художественными сокровищами, но и своими изобретениями и открытиями. Итальянские исследователи Христофор Колумб и Америго Веспуччи открыли Америку, а другой итальянский купец и путешественник Марко Поло, был одним из первых европейцев, исследовавших Восток.\nЛеонардо да Винчи был художником и изобретателем. Его журналы включают большое количество изобретений, практичных и непрактичных: музыкальные инструменты, летающие машины, военные машины и подводная лодка.\nАлессандро Вольта изучал электричество и дал свое имя «Вольт» единице электроэнергии. Итальянцы изобрели многие музыкальные инструменты, в том числе фортепиано.\nДругое итальянское изобретение, покорившее мир — пицца. Существует легенда о том, как пицца Маргарита получила свое название.\nВ 1889 году итальянский король Умберто I и королева Маргарита решили нанести визит в Неаполь. Самый известный производитель пиццы в Неаполе, Раффаэле Эспозито, испек три пиццы для королевы в дворцовой кухне. Королева предпочитала пиццу в цветах итальянского флага: красный (томаты), зеленый (базилик) и белый (моцарелла). Этот вид пиццы впоследствии был назван в честь королевы – пицца Маргарита.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Copyright© 2015 teachershelp.ru",

      "Why do people hate cable companies? If you ask 100 different people you’ll get 100 different answers, but there will undoubtedly be a few common threads that run through the vast majority of them. Poor customer service will likely be somewhere near the top of the list. While just about every major cable company in the country has acknowledged customer care issues to some degree, progress in this area is painfully slow and cable companies are regularly at the bottom of surveys that deal with customer service.High prices are another pain point, and quality of service often comes up when people complain about their cable providers. When people pay $80, $120, even $200 or more per month, they want their Internet speeds to be as fast as advertised, and every outage stings more than the last.People constantly take to the Internet to discuss why they hate their cable company and we’ve heard practically every story there is to hear, but there’s one unique perspective that hasn’t been explored: Why does Brian Roberts, CEO of what may be the most disliked cable company in the country, think people hate cable companies so much?DON’T MISS: New smartphone with a battery that lasts up to 15 days launches next monthDuring the Ignition conference this past weekend, Henry Blodget interviewed Comcast CEO Brian Roberts during one of the sessions. A number of topics were covered — and a number of softballs were lobbed — but the pair did touch on some hot button items.Roberts fielded a question about Comcast’s data caps, which have certainly been a sore subject among subscribers in the recent past. Leaked Comcast documents confirmed what we all already knew, that these caps are all about increasing profits and have nothing to do with congestion, and we discussed several reasons why Comcast’s caps are so awful.Of course, Roberts gave the standard answers when addressing the data caps: 95% of customers are unaffected, pricing is fair, and so on.The most interesting portion of the interview is perhaps when Roberts fielded a follow-up question to the data cap discussion. Blodget broadened the conversation and asked Roberts to address the general public’s impressions of cable companies, and Roberts’s responds included a few interesting notes.Here’s the relevant excerpt:The full interview transcript is available by following the link below in our source section.Copyright 2018 BGR Media, LLCPowered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Ad Choices | Privacy Preferences | Terms Of Use",
      "﻿’Your greatest achievement’ may be part of an answer to the interview questions – tell me about yourself.\nIf you don’t include this part in your answer, the interviewer may ask about your greatest achievements to get a clear picture of your career.\nTherefore, in order to know who you really are, the interviewer would like to assess your career accomplishments.This article provides tips on answering the interview question – What is your achievement? Or What would you consider as your biggest achievement and why?What is my greatest achievement so far?\nThink of:Let’s start brainstorming – How did you improve ‘things’ while you were working at your previous jobs?\nFor example:\n• Great initiatives and fresh ideas.\n• Have you shaken old methods?\n• Developed a new program.\n• Target sales, new sales.\n• Reached new clients?\n• Developed a new customer satisfaction procedure?\n• Improved the accuracy of budget forecasts?\n• New design on time-schedule.\n• Achieved project goals.\n• Established good working relationships with customers.\n• Great team work.\n• Established new quality standards.Think of the actions that you took to achieve the goal. Every single step that you have taken for achieving the objectives:\n• Tasks during the activity\n• Your personal management activities\n• The changes and difficulties that you handled effectively.• How was your target goal measured?\n• Who was the initiator – you or your bosses?\n• What did your bosses say after achieving these goals?What were the results of your achievement?\nFor example:\n• Better quality performance or reliability?\n• Did you make any difference in sales numbers, costs and profits?\n• What about customer satisfaction?\n• Did you improve support service level? What about productivity, efficiency and the company’s reputation? Did you make any difference?After thinking about the above questions you may have a perfect answer to the question – what were your greatest achievements?\nP.S. It would be wise for you to present a career achievement that reflects back to the job requirements and to the company to which you are applying.\nIn this way, you gain the employer’s interest – tell a success story where you have had a challenge with an impressive achievement.\nYou want the interviewer to think: hey, if he/she did it once, he/she can do it again!",
      "First impressions are often lasting impressions, and the interview is usually the first opportunity to make a positive impression on a potential employer. Make sure you're prepared for interviews by practicing your responses to some of the most commonly asked interview questions. At the same time, don't forget that you are, in a way, interviewing the employer as well to learn more about the position and organization. The interview should flow as a conversation, where both parties are trying to learn if the other is a good fit.1. Tell me about yourself. The employer is looking for a brief summary about you and is more interested in hearing about your educational and professional background than your hobbies and favorite foods. See if you can sum up your educational and professional background in about 60 seconds and ensure that you make connections between your background and the position for which you are interviewing.2. Why do you want to intern/train here? Focus on a few of the key responsibilities that are especially interesting to you or highlight aspects of the company that you find appealing or beneficial to your professional development. Be sure to include what you hope to learn from the position, but also explain what you would like to contribute to the organization as well. Absolutely avoid mentioning you want the position solely because of its location or because it is a requirement for your degree.3. What do you know about this industry? You may not have a lot of experience in the field yet, but make sure you have researched and are ready to discuss current trends â particularly what's happening in the U.S. and in your home country. It's also extremely important to refer to specifics from internships or work experience you've had in the past or topics you've recently studied in school.4. What do you know about our company? A potential employer wants to know that you have researched their company. You don't need to know everything about the company, but you should be able to discuss the basics. Find out what the company's mission statement is, who the biggest clients are, etc. Research recent news articles about them. The company's website, blog, and social media is also a great place to start.5. What specific skills do you have that would relate to this position? Make sure you've thoroughly read the requirements for the position and confirm that you meet them. Refer to specific responsibilities of the position and tie them to your educational and/or professional experience. If you aren't applying to a specific internship/training opening and are proposing the program to the employer, be sure to explain that you have a strong foundation for training in this industry. They will understand that they will need to teach and train you, but they will also want to know you have sufficient preparation to be successful.6. What makes you a good candidate for the position? Discuss your qualifications, including your educational background (include specific coursework or projects), internships and professional work experience. You may also want to include some personal characteristics (e.g. motivated, hardworking, getting along with many different types of people, etc.), but do not simply list positive attributes. The interviewer is more interested in how you demonstrate these skills or attributes.For example, instead of saying you are motivated, provide an example of how you proactively identified a need at a previous company and subsequently led a project to meet that need. This will prove that you are motivated without you just saying, \"I'm highly motivated.\" If an employer ever asks you to \"tell me about a timeâ¦\" this is the type of response they are seeking. They don't want to hear that you are good at time managementâthey want you to provide actual examples of your time management skills.7. Tell me about your strengths. Many people are inclined to recite a list of traits such as \"dependable\" or \"creative\", but it's especially effective to discuss experience or skills that are directly related to the internship/training program to which you're applying. For example, if you're applying to intern/train in Sales but have no previous sales experience; highlighting your presentation skills might really impress an employer. Or you may want to provide an example of how you were able to persuade someone to do something since that is the foundation of the sales industry. Again, provide actual examples rather than a list of attributes.8. What is your biggest weakness? This is one of the most challenging questions to answer. You obviously don't want to say something negative about yourself to a potential employer, so the trick here is to turn a negative into a positive. For example: \"Staying organized used to be a challenge, but I developed a time management system that works for me and that has really helped keep me organized.\"9. Why should I hire you for the position? Give specific examples of your accomplishments and why you are the best person for the position. Talk about the responsibilities of the position and the skills you possess to fulfill them. Be sure to restate your interest in the position!10. What are your goals for the future? An employer wants to know that the position relates to what you hope to do in the future because it's a sign that you will be motivated to learn and work hard in the position. Talk about your goals and explain how the position would help you achieve those goals.1. What is the overall structure of the company and how does your department fit within that structure? This is a good way to get a sense of the how the company operates and what each department does so that you can see how your role as an intern/trainee would fit into this organization.2. What will be my day-to-day responsibilities? Can you give me an example of a project on which I would be working? You should ideally know the major responsibilities of the position before interviewing, but this question will help you get a better sense of the more specific types of tasks you would be doing and the anticipated level of your involvement within the organization.3. Can you describe the work environment/office culture? Is it casual? More corporate/formal? You will want to know the office dynamic before accepting an internship position with the company. Can you see yourself training in a similar environment? How does this office compare to offices in your home country or previous positions you've held?4. What do you like about working here? Be curious and inquisitive! Show that you are interested in the interviewer's background and experience at the company. You will learn about the advantages of having an internship with them and get some firsthand insight.5. Why are you interested in hiring an intern? This is a great way to gauge the employer's motivation for having an intern in the first place. You can better understand what they might have you working on and what type of role they envision you having.6. What is the typical career path for interns or employees in this department? You can relate this question to your long-term career aspirations by mentioning where you see yourself in a few years and how this position ties into those future professional goals. Maybe the employer will mention a previous intern. Do you share a similar background with that intern? This is a great way to learn about what a typical or potential career track might be.7. What would you consider to be the most important aspects of this internship role? You can use this question to really emphasize your strengths and draw on your education and/or previous experience. The better you are at understanding the expectations for the position, the better you can show them how you will meet those expectations and be an exceptional intern/trainee.8. What do you think is the most challenging aspect of this position? This interview is an opportunity to really learn about your employer's expectations for the position. You can also turn this into a conversation about challenges you've faced in your previous positions and how you have overcome them. (Hopefully very well!)9. Does the company participate in any team-building activities, traditions or events?  The purpose of the Career Training USA program is cultural exchange. The program is a really great way to learn more about U.S. culture and to share your culture with Americans. This question allows you to learn about opportunities or activities for you to get involved in with the company.10. What are the next steps in the interview process? You don't want to be pushy about when you will find out if they have offered you the internship, so this is a good way of asking what happens next.1. What does this company do? Show that you have done your homework! The interviewer will think you are wasting their time if you ask questions that you can easily find the answer to yourself, such as on their website.2. Can I change my schedule? What salary, vacation time and benefits do I get? Wait until you are offered the internship before negotiating things like salary and vacation time (if applicable). You certainly want to have these things agreed upon before accepting an offer, however you don't want to give them the impression that you only care about the perks of position instead of the position itself.3. Did I get the position? Be patient! You can follow up with them via email after the interview, perhaps a few days later, to inquire about next steps.Also, don't forget to send a separate thank you email to each person who interviewed you within 24 hours of your interview. It sounds simple, but it often goes a long way. It's also another way to reiterate your strong interest in the position. Did you think of another question you didn't get a chance to ask? Include it in your follow-up email!Want more practice questions?

      "A huge merger may turn the son of a Philadelphia Jewish entrepreneur into one of the most powerful Americans in the media industry.Brian Roberts, 54, chairman and CEO of Comcast, a cable and broadband provider that announced on February 13 its intention to take over Time Warner Cable in a $45 billion deal, seeks to control the cable services of more than 32 million American homes, which would make him the unchallenged leader in the field.The merger — which still needs congressional and regulatory approval — marks the latest step in the Roberts family’s long road from a modest start by his father and two Jewish partners in Tupelo, Miss. 50 years ago, to becoming America’s largest provider of home media content.Roberts, a Maccabiah Games squash gold medalist known for his affinity for Israel, has not made his mark on Jewish life. But his Jewish identity, friends say, should not be doubted.“Brian’s commitment to religion and Jewish causes is like every other thing he does: It is extremely personal and low-profile,” Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor, told the Forward. Roberts, he added, “does not carry these things on his chest.”But it is part of his company’s DNA. Comcast was established in 1969 by Roberts’s father Ralph and his two Jewish partners, Daniel Aaron and Julian Brodsky. During a poker game, Ralph Roberts had heard about a small cable company in Tupelo looking for investors and the three partners decided to step in.Aaron’s family had escaped growing anti-Semitism in Nazi Germany and arrived in New York in 1937. Both his parents committed suicide shortly after and Aaron and his brother were placed in foster families by a Jewish relief agency. Years later, Aaron said that his life was lived in the “shadow of the Holocaust.” When Brian Roberts joined the family company, Aaron was his first boss. “He had the greatest heart and social conscience,” Roberts recalled when discussing his involvement with Steven Spielberg’s Shoah Foundation. Aaron died in 2003 from Parkinson’s disease.Brodsky, the third founder of Comcast, stayed with the company until his retirement in 2011. He served as vice chairman and is credited with pushing Comcast into the internet business, but when it came time to pass the business on to the next generation, Ralph Roberts, who by then owned a larger share of the company, brought in his son to take over. Brodsky and his wife Lois run a $10 million family foundation that supports many communal and progressive causes, including Jewish services and organizations.Ralph Roberts’s approach to business was shaped by the Great Depression. He grew up in an affluent Jewish family, but when fortunes turned, the family lost all, teaching young Ralph about the need for caution and saving. He purchased a belt and suspenders company, sold it when competition grew, and then moved on to cable TV, a field that was controlled at the time by small local companies. A supporter of Jewish organizations, Ralph Roberts has been honored by the Anti-Defamation League and by B’nai B’rith International. His wife, Suzanne Roberts, is an actress and television host.Of the couple’s five children, Brian Roberts was the only one to take an interest in the family business and the relationship he developed with his father is still considered unique. Brian Roberts, who considers his father a mentor and his closest business partner, started visiting the Comcast offices at the age of 13, poring through annual reports and documents. In high school, he spent recess reading the Wall Street Journal, and after graduating from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he asked his father if he could join the business. Ralph Roberts sent the designated heir to start from the bottom, selling cable subscriptions door to door and climbing cable poles. But by the age of 30, Brian Roberts was already CEO.His focus has always been on business, with one clear exception: squash. Roberts’s love for the sport has also been his sole public manifestation of his Jewish identity, using a squash racquet to express his closeness to other Jews and to Israel.Roberts made his first visit to Israel for the 1981 Maccabiah Games. Four years later, again representing the United States at squash, he proposed to his future wife Aileen Kennedy in Israel, and in later years both of their daughters played in the Maccabiah Games.“We are a mixed marriage, so our kids were raised with a little less Judaism than I was raised with,” Roberts said in video produced by Maccabi USA, “and so I was always looking for a way to connect them in a way that felt natural.”He recalled that his daughters were moved by the symbolic bat mitzvah ceremony held for young Maccabiah participants, prompting the family to decide to “have a normal bar mitzvah for [their] son.” The world of Jewish athletics, Roberts added, “really played a very meaningful role in helping us go through some very complicated and personal issues.”It also left Roberts with a gold medal and three silver ones from the five times he participated. “These are the only things he has hanging in his office,” said Jed Margolis, executive director of Maccabi USA. Roberts donated squash courts in Ra’anana, Israel and has supported Maccabi USA, hosting the recent send-off party for athletes on the rooftop of Comcast’s Philadelphia headquarters.“He has a real strong affinity to Israel,” said David Pudlin, a Philadelphia lawyer and Roberts’s squash partner, “and he is a great squash player.”Described by all as low key and media shy, both calculated and aggressive, Roberts has led Comcast into a series of acquisitions and mergers that have turned the family business into a media giant. The company took over the shopping TV channel QVC, then a chunk of AT&T broadband subscribers, and in 2009 bought the majority holding of NBCUniversal.According to Forbes Magazine, Roberts’s net worth reached $1 billion last year. His philanthropic giving spans many local and national charities; one of the highlights of his efforts was providing the funding to restore a synagogue located in the historic Eastern State Penitentiary. Donations by Ralph and Brian Roberts allowed the synagogue, which was used in the past by Jewish inmates, to open to visitors in 2009. It was named after Alfred Fleisher, Brian Roberts’s maternal grandfather, who founded the Jewish house of worship while serving as president of the prison’s board of trustees.Comcast has supported politicians from both parties, as long as they were on the side of its business interests, but Roberts personally has leaned more Democratic. He was a member of the president’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness and hosted President Barack Obama at his summer home in Martha’s Vineyard. “He is a fiscally conservative Democrat,” said Rendell, who also enjoyed Roberts’s support while governor.Comcast’s political activity, however, is entrusted to Executive Vice President David L. Cohen. A close confidant of and former top aide to Rendell, Cohen is now in charge of Comcast’s greatest challenge — convincing regulators and Congress that the series of mergers and acquisitions does not make the Philadelphia company into a media monopoly. As described in a recent New York Times article, much of Comcast’s success in Washington has to do with Cohen’s policy of helping out communal and ethnic organizations and in return, gaining their support when needed on the Hill. In one such case, Comcast gave $180,000 to the Baltimore-based Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel. In 2010, the organization sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission supporting Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal.Cohen is a board member of the Philadelphia Jewish federation and a donor to many local and national Jewish causes.Another key Jewish officer in the Comcast empire is Arthur Block, the company’s senior vice president and general counsel.All will now share the burden of selling the Time Warner Cable deal to skeptical regulators, critical members of Congress and to consumer advocates concerned over Comcast’s domination of the market and the company’s problematic customer service record.On Capitol Hill they will meet opposition led by Senator Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, who in the past grilled Roberts over the NBC deal. Franken has already expressed his “serious reservations” about the Time Warner Cable merger and has called the FCC to apply careful scrutiny before giving it the stamp of approval. He, too, is Jewish.Contact Nathan Guttman at guttman@forward.com or on Twitter @nathanguttmanNathan Guttman, staff writer, is the Forward’s Washington bureau chief.

      "by Jacob Share“What have you done in the past when faced with a problem on the job?”Describe a difficult situation you encountered in a previous job, and how you resolved it.Tell me about a problem you had to solve in a previous position.”Describe a difficult task, and how you handled it.“Can you provide an example of a time when you (made a mistake at work, under-performed on a task, etc.) and how you overcame this.”This is actually one of the better interview questions asked, both for you and the interviewer, and here are the reasons why (from the interviewer’s standpoint; we’ll get to you soon).It’s a solid, basic, open-ended question that an interviewer can ask any candidate.When asked properly, the question can surprise candidates, as opposed to other questions which are easier to anticipate and prepare answers for.It allows the interviewer to get a handle on how a candidate responds in a situation that doesn’t have a clear, easy, yes-or-no answer.When an interviewer gets a handle on this, they then know how a candidate will most likely respond to unforeseen challenges and difficult situations in the role they’re interviewing for.Interview questions about difficult situations at work can really allow you to shine.They allow you to flex your storytelling muscles.They’re a good overall test of your person-to-person communications abilities.Since it’s about recalling an actual experience (as opposed to imaginatively working through a presented scenario), they should be less stressful to answer.Finally, they lets you show off your personality, and allow you to be a real human being (as opposed to the perfect, error-free interviewing machine you’re aiming to be). Everyone has had to deal with a difficult situation at work—when you talk about yours in an interview, you show a vulnerable, human side of yourself. Just be sure that the story you tell has an ending in which you overcome the difficult situation, and learn an important lesson about yourself (which you should of course let your interviewer know about).If you have thought about the difficult situation interview question ahead of time and prepared a response, know this: smart interviewers have a simple trick that they can use to catch you off guard by qualifying the question further. For example:Tell me how you handled a difficult situation where . . .you needed to cover for a supervisor.you had a tight deadline to meet, and needed to act quickly.you could have handled things better, looking back on it now.For best results, the angle an interviewer puts on the question should be related to any issues of concern they may have about you. For example,Tell me how you handled a difficult situation . . .where you felt that you didn’t have enough experience to properly respond (for a student applying for an entry-level position).with a colleague who is constantly bringing up a sensitive issue for you (for an ex-con).where you had to deal with a much younger supervisor who was clearly in over their head (for an older job seeker).One straightforward way to respond to interview questions about difficult situations at work is to use the STAR technique.Situation/Task:Describe the challenging situation/task that you needed to deal with.Action:What action(s) did you take to remedy things? Be specific.Results:What were the results of your action(s)? What would have happened if you hadn’t reacted that way?While following this simple formula, you’ll also want to focus on aspects related to your reasoning, integrity, or initiative, or your ability to reach out to superiors when you don’t know the answer. For example:Talking about an ethical dilemma in which you chose to act with integrity.Discussing your initiative in tackling a difficult situation to a positive end.Discussing how you worked through a dilemma and found a solution.If you haven’t thought this question through ahead of time (and you really should), there’s a good chance that you may not be able to think of something off the top of your head. Here are some things to avoid speaking about when answering this question.Don’t speak poorly of former or current companies or co-workers.Don’t be self-focused to the point of discussing yourself in a superior light.Avoid discussing your own shortcomings . . . unless you also mention your growth.Don’t choose a situation that isn’t job-related unless you have no work experience.Your potential employer wants to know that you can effectively work through a difficult situation on the job, so be sure to avoid a self-deprecating attitude. While people love self-deprecating humor in real life, the short time span of a job interview really isn’t the time for it. Take the question seriously, and answer it seriously.If the interviewer asks about a situation you’ve never had to deal with, it’s okay to say so, but they can then easily change the question to “How WOULD you deal with a difficult situation like that?” In other words, they can switch from the historical to the hypothetical, which makes the question a lot harder all of a sudden.With that in mind, the best follow-up response would be to say “That’s never happened to me, but if that kind of situation did come up, here’s how I would handle it . . . .” And from there, you apply the STAR technique.“During a summer session I had a student who was writing rude, offensive notes on student papers during peer grading assignments. I arranged a meeting with the student, and had my principal attend too, as a witness. I calmly yet firmly informed the student that the types of comments she was providing weren’t helpful—that they were in fact detrimental. From there, the three of us had a fruitful discussion on the types of comments that work best on student papers. In the end, the student walked away with a solid understanding of how to provide constructive, non-offensive feedback to other students.”“Late one Friday afternoon at my last job, a client called with an urgent question about the project we were working on for them. My boss usually handles all client contact directly, but he had already left for the weekend. I explained the situation to the client, and said that although I might not know the exact answer to the question, that I was also working on the project and might be able to help. That was good enough for the client, and while it was true that I didn’t have the answer immediately, we were able to work through it together fairly quickly, and the client got off the call assured that they wouldn’t need to worry about the issue over the weekend. I also left a note for my boss about the call, so that he could check with the client on his return on Monday morning.”PS:If you’re still struggling with getting calls back for interviews, LiveCareer can help.

Ты возьмешь на себя роль грозного и могущественного колдуна, который захотел создать своё смертельное подземелье, где будут лишаться жизни плохие и надоедливые персонажи. Тебе нужно будет выстраивать большое количество комнат, в которых ты будешь располагать страшные ловушки для своих жертв. Также не забывай выстраивать запутанные коридоры, из которых очень сложно будет найти выход. Не забывай, что территорию требуется охранять, поэтому расставь по всему подземелью своих верных солдат. Стиль игры очень прост, но этим то и заманивает KeeperRL. Каждый раз, начиная новую игру, мир будет полностью меняться, поэтому тебе будет всегда интересно проводить здесь время. Каждый раз всё новые подземелья, существа, комнаты с ловушками и персонажи.
