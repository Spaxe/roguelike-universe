      "ToeJam & Earl is an action game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console. Released in 1991, it centers on ToeJam and Earl—alien rappers who have crash-landed on Earth. As they attempt to escape the planet, players assume the role of either character and collect pieces of their wrecked spacecraft. ToeJam & Earl's design was heavily influenced by the role-playing video game Rogue, and took from it such features as the random generation of levels and items. It references and parodies 1980s and early 90s urban culture and is set to a funk soundtrack.\nThe game was positively received by critics, who praised its originality, soundtrack, humor and two-player cooperative mode. It attained sleeper hit status despite low initial sales, and its protagonists were used as mascots by Sega. ToeJam & Earl was followed by two sequels: ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron and ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, released for the Sega Genesis and Xbox, respectively. The sequels' commercial and critical success was mixed. A fourth title, ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove, is currently in development with funds from Kickstarter. The game was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in December 2006 and re-released again on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in November 2012.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nToeJam & Earl has been called a surreal, comic satire, and a \"daringly misanthropic commentary on Earthly life\". ToeJam is red and has three legs. Earl is fat and orange. ToeJam wears a large gold medallion and a backwards baseball cap, while Earl is marked by high-tops and oversized sunglasses; both outfits are \"over-the-top appropriations\" of 1990s urban culture. Their speech features California slang. The game is set to a soundtrack which has been described both as jazz-funk, and as hip hop. For the game's unique sound, composer John Baker was inspired by Herbie Hancock and The Headhunters.In the game's opening sequence, ToeJam explains that Earl's erratic piloting abilities have resulted in a crash-landing on planet Earth. He says that they must find the widely scattered pieces of their spacecraft's wreckage to return to their home planet, Funkotron. The player guides the characters as they avoid Earth's antagonistic inhabitants and search for the debris. Should the player succeed, the final sequence depicts ToeJam and Earl escaping the planet in their reconstructed spacecraft. Under the player's control, the characters proceed across a purple landscape that represents Funkotron, and are greeted by their friends and family.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nToeJam & Earl takes place from a 3/4 perspective in a 2D game world. Its gameplay mechanics were inspired by Rogue, which has led to its description as a Roguelike or dungeon-crawl game. The game contains both single-player and two-player cooperative modes. The latter displays a single screen when both characters are near each other, but splits it apart when they are not. Playing the game with two players reveals dialogue and jokes between the characters not heard in the single player game.The game is set on Earth, which is represented by randomly generated islands that float in space, each one a layer above the last. They are connected by elevators. Some islands contain pieces of spacecraft wreckage, of which the player must collect 10 to win the game. The player character drops to the island below if he falls from an island's edge, which necessitates that the player again locate an elevator. Each island is populated by antagonistic \"Earthlings\", such as phantom ice-cream trucks, aggressive packs of \"nerds\", giant hamsters, Bogeymen, man-eating mailboxes, and chickens armed with mortars that shoot tomatoes. Certain Earthlings aid the player. The game has been described as \"largely non-violent\", as the protagonists can only attack enemies with thrown tomatoes—one of many temporary, randomly generated power-ups.Power-ups are contained in wrapped presents, which are categorized by appearance. The contents of a present are unknown to the player until it is opened; afterwards, all presents of that appearance are identified. Presents with question marks can hold any item at random, so their contents cannot be identified on sight alone. Identification of presents' contents is a central gameplay mechanic. Each power-up has a unique effect: while one might increase the player characters' running speed, another distracts enemies. Certain presents contain harmful power-ups, such the loss of a \"life\", or the \"Randomizer\", which resets the identity of all presents. In the game's cooperative mode, if one player character opens a present in the vicinity of the other, its contents affect both characters. As players open more presents, the chances of accidentally opening the Randomizer are increased, which prevents the game from becoming easier as more presents are identified.\n\n\n== Development ==\nToeJam & Earl creator Greg Johnson became a fan of Rogue as a university student. After he left university, he worked on games for Electronic Arts, including Starflight (1986). After the completion of Starflight 2, Johnson conceived ToeJam & Earl—first the characters, then the plot—while on a beach in Hawaii. The idea was a combination of Rogue's gameplay concepts and a lighter version of Starflight's science-fiction themes. Johnson met programmer Mark Voorsanger through a mutual friend, while walking on Mount Tam in 1989. He related the concept of ToeJam & Earl to Voorsanger, and the two resolved to make the game together. They formed Johnson Voorsanger Productions, and serious work on the game began soon after. Their status as commercial game designers allowed them to meet with Sega of America, and they used cards covered in landscape drawings to demonstrate their idea of randomly generated levels. Sega marketing manager Hugh Bowen was immediately interested in the concept and he enlisted the aid of producer Scott Berfield to sell the game to management; Sega wanted innovative games and new mascots to compete with Nintendo.The game's small development team was composed of Johnson's previous colleagues, and its music was composed by John Baker. The team's goal was to make a humorous game that was \"original, easy to understand and offered an immediate response to the player's actions\". The designers wanted to include a two-player mode so that they could play together, and considered ToeJam & Earl \"a two player game with a one player option.\" While Sega believed that hardware issues would prevent the feature from working, Voorsanger successfully implemented it. In a 1992 interview with Sega Visions, Johnson stated that the characters ToeJam and Earl evolved as reflections of his and Voorsanger's personalities. Voorsanger disagreed, and called the characters \"two different aspects of Greg's personality\". Steve Purcell has stated that he contributed character designs to the game.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nToeJam & Earl received positive reviews, which Bill Paris of UGO described as \"almost unanimous critical acclaim\". However, Sega deemed it a commercial failure due to low initial sales. The game built a cult following through word of mouth, and it was further aided by the Sega Genesis's Christmas 1991 sales spike, caused by the release of Sonic the Hedgehog. ToeJam & Earl was later considered a \"cult\" success. According to Ken Horowitz (2016, p. 74) author of Playing the Next Level: A History of American Sega Games, \"In all, the game sold 350,000 copies for Sega, a remarkable feat for such an unconventional title on a fledgling console.\"Mean Machines found the game addictive and original, but found fault with its slow-paced combat. One of the reviewers said, \"Not everyone will like it—it's not normal enough for mass appeal—but I think it's destined to become a massive cult classic\". GamePro called the game's originality \"incredible\", and praised its graphics, music and humor. MegaTech praised the graphics, and the 2-player option, and said the game was \"great fun - pure and simple\".\nMega said that it was \"An OK game, but one which becomes completely essential when played with someone else. Got any friends? Buy this. Haven't got any friends? Buy this and make some\". The game also appeared at number 26 on its list of the best games of all time. Entertainment Weekly praised the \"absolutely hilarious\" sound effects and music. Jeff Csatari of Boys' Life called it \"another hot game\" for the Sega Genesis, alongside Sonic the Hedgehog. Ed Martinez of Game Informer commended the game's soundtrack and unique concept, but found it to be too easy.A review published in both the Chicago Tribune and Rome News-Tribune likened ToeJam and Earl to \"an outer-space, rap version of Abbott and Costello\". The reviewers called it \"the funniest game we've seen in a long time\", and praised its soundtrack, graphics and action.The Toronto Star acclaimed the game's \"hilariously designed split-screen two-player mode\", and said, \"If you've got a Sega-Genesis system, you simply must check out [this] awesome rap 'n' roll game\". Sega Visions praised the game's \"no-repetitive action\" and said, \"This is the zaniest game that ever rocked Sega's Genesis system.\" Several months after the game's release, Mega ranked it the 13th best Sega Genesis game in its All-Time Top 100 feature. The magazine praised the game's \"superbly manic and zany action\", and deemed it both \"original and insane\". The Channel 4 video game programme GamesMaster gave the game a 70% rating.\nToeJam & Earl was re-released on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console in 2006. Official Nintendo Magazine scored the game 85%, and praised its humor, originality and two-player mode. However, the reviewer believed that the game's enjoyability had diminished with time. GameSpot felt that the game's 1990s idioms were dated, but that the gameplay—particularly the two-player mode—was still enjoyable by modern standards. Jeremy Parish of 1UP found the game's two-player co-operative mode more enjoyable than its single-player, and described the graphics and sound as \"oddly primitive\". Parish considered it \"one of the best games to hit VC to date\". Eurogamer's reviewer negatively received the game, and believed its gameplay to be unsatisfying and overly slow. IGN called the game's visuals a \"mixed bag\" and derided the slow pace, but praised its unpredictability and believed that its sound design was \"one thing you absolutely can't fault\".\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nToeJam and Earl became \"one of Sega's second tier mascots, alongside Sonic\", and one of the Sega Genesis's \"key exclusive franchises\". The characters appeared in a spin-off light gun game, Ready, Aim, Tomatoes, developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions as one of six mini-games for the Menacer 6-game cartridge. In early 1992, the developers began work on a sequel to ToeJam & Earl, and spent three months expanding on the original game's concept by adding indoor areas and more terrain types. Sega was not impressed by the sequel, and believed it to be unmarketable. The team redesigned it as a platform game, as Sega was inclined to publish games in this genre. The game, titled ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, was highly anticipated, and was a commercial and critical success when it released in 1993. However, fans of the original game were disappointed by the change in design to a perceived generic style. Due to poor North American sales of the Sega Saturn, Sega's next generation video game console, the ToeJam & Earl franchise was neglected. A ToeJam & Earl game planned for the Dreamcast was cancelled (a beta of the game was preserved, and on Christmas Day 2013 released on the internet by enthusiasts), but a third installment, ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, was released for the Xbox in 2002. The release returned to the concepts of the original game, but generated mixed reviews and poor sales. A new ToeJam & Earl game is currently in development by HumaNature Studios.ToeJam & Earl has been called \"weird\", \"strange\", and \"thoroughly odd\". Critics have difficulty in determining a genre for the game; it has been called a platform game and Roguelike, as well as action and action-adventure. While ToeJam & Earl's success did not match that of the Sega Genesis's other popular titles, it has been considered a \"classic\", and a \"cult\" game. Prior to ToeJam & Earl III's conception, research by its developers found that the original ToeJam & Earl was preferred over its sequel. In an IGN survey, 65% of respondents cited it as their favorite of the three games. The game was set to be re-released on Xbox Live Arcade after winning a poll arranged by Sega, but this became uncertain because Johnson owns the rights to the characters rather than Sega. The game, along with its sequel, was announced as part of Sega Vintage Collection series for release on November 7, 2012, to be released individually on PlayStation Network and as a collection on Xbox Live Arcade. The notion of a ToeJam & Earl game for the Nintendo DS failed to generate interest from publishers, but Johnson has reiterated the possibility of such a game in the future.  Greg Johnson would later be able to give Toejam and Earl a comeback with a new game called Toejam & Earl: Back in the Groove, which was made by his own independent game developing company HumaNature Studios, and was also made possible by Kickstarter fundraising.  Greg Johnson said he was able to make a new ToeJam and Earl game without needing a publisher, since the popularity of downloadable independent games, but Adult Swim Games came to publish the game as well as for retail copies.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nToeJam & Earl Productions: Developer's official website\nToeJam & Earl's Virtual Console site",
      "ToeJam & Earl Productions was an American video game developer. Founders Mark Voorsanger and Greg Johnson started the company in 1989.At the beginning, the company was known simply as Johnson Voorsanger Productions, or just \"JVP\" as they were credited in the original ToeJam & Earl and in its sequel Panic on Funkotron. After the success of the ToeJam & Earl games, the company was renamed into the more iconic brand of ToeJam & Earl Productions.JVP introduced the ToeJam & Earl series with the original ToeJam & Earl, followed by Ready-Aim-Tomatoes (a mini-game for Sega's light-gun The Menacer), and the platformer-sequel ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron. Each was developed exclusively for the Mega Drive/Sega Genesis and published by Sega of America.  The latest title in the series was ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, co-developed by Visual Concepts for the original Xbox.ToeJam & Earl Productions also created Orly's Draw-A-Story, a multi-award-winning CD-ROM for kids ages 5 to 10. Orly's Draw-A-Story was designed for PCs and Macs and was published by Broderbund.The company was forced to disband after poor sales of ToeJam & Earl III.[1] Mark Voorsanger currently runs a coaching business out of the same building where ToeJam & Earl Productions was and Greg Johnson started his own video game development studio called HumaNature Studios, and currently owns the ToeJam & Earl intellectual property rights.[1][2][3] Greg Johnson currently has a Nintendo DS game in development, but he has not found a publisher yet.[4]vte\nToeJam & Earl video gamesGames\nToeJam & Earl · ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron · ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to EarthRelated\nReady, Aim, Tomatoes! · ToeJam & Earl ProductionsToeJam & Earl · ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron · ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to EarthReady, Aim, Tomatoes! · ToeJam & Earl Productions",
      "Title: ToeJam & EarlDeveloper: Johnson Voorsanger ProductionsYear: 1991Platform: Sega GenesisGenre: Action, Dungeon Crawler, RoguelikeUnless you’re a total gaming nerd, you might not be familiar with the roguelike genre. This is a subgenre of typically role-playing video games that spawned from the video game Rogue. Most, but not all tend to be turn-based games with randomly generated levels and permanent death of the character forcing the player to start from the beginning of the game each time a character is generated.An old genre dating back to the late seventies, these games consisted of ASCII graphics. Even to this day, a lot of developers keep true to the tradition when making a new roguelike game. However, some developers have decided to keep up the times and find new ways to give the genre a modern twist.The growing popularity of the roguelike genre over the past few years has kept me excited. Video games tend to operate on a basis of rewarding the player, and with roguelikes functioning in a somewhat opposite way it is difficult to bring this kind of genre into the mainstream. However, I am easily reminded of one of my favorite roguelike games that not only was so unique, but also so masterfully made itself appealing to fans outside of the genre. That game is ToeJam & Earl.ToeJam & Earl was released in 1991 for the Sega Genesis platform, and is the cornerstone release of Johnson Voorsanger Productions (later renamed ToeJam & Earl Productions). The release was somewhat early in the Genesis’s lifespan, and the titular characters were intended to be part of the list of new mascots Sega was planning to push out on the heels of Sonic The Hedgehog.ToeJam & Earl are aliens hailing from the planet Funkotron (not very creative, I admit) who end up crashing their spaceship into earth after running into a meteor shower. Now they have to avoid hostile earthlings and rebuild their ship in order to return home.Levels are groups of fragmented islands, some connected by thin strips of land. Each of these has an elevator somewhere in the map that will take you to the next level. If you fall off into space, you land on the previous level. Earthlings inhabit every level. The earthling choices are comical. These can range from Hawaiian dancers, boogeymen, stampeding nerd herds, and even Santa Claus. Some Earthlings will offer to help you, usually for a price, but most want to harm you.The game world is filled with presents, which contain random things to benefit you like increased movement or the means to defeat enemies. Presents also contain many things that will harm, slow down or outright kill your character. Identifying these presents early on is crucial to avoid opening a bad present at an inopportune moment later on. Unfortunately, identifying presents comes through trial and error—or paying one of the scattered wise men a lot of money to do it for you. All your risks in identifying can easily be wiped by opening a “randomizer” present, which mixes up the contents and the look of all presents, making you having to start back at square one for identifying.The characters are unique, one being a red 3-legged creature in a backwards cap and medallion, and the other being a giant yellow slug in board shorts and sunglasses. They are clear appropriations of ’90s urban culture, and their speech is rich with California slang of the era.No, there is no dungeon-crawling or medieval hack-and-slash like you would find with Rogue or other notable roguelikes, but the presence of permadeath, limited character resources, and randomly-generated levels and items holds true. Earthlings are usually tough to dispatch, requiring special items to do so that aren’t easy to come by. Because of this, avoiding them is crucial in order to survive and reach your goal. Sounds stressful? Surprisingly, it is quite the opposite. Besides the most dire situations that are found in far later levels, avoiding enemies, collecting items, and locating pieces of your missing spaceship feel absolutely laidback. Gameplay is leisurely and chill which is one of the biggest reasons why this game is so marvelous. On paper, it is difficult, but it doesn’t feel difficult.The soundtrack is superb, filled with memorably upbeat funk and hip hop tunes inspired by the likes of The Headhunters and Herbie Hancock. This level of effort and quality put into producing was unheard of for console gaming at the time and takes full advantage of the Genesis’s YM2612 FM synthesizer.Unfortunately, the sequels to this game just couldn’t measure up to the original, largely to pressure from the publisher. A sequel designed to be a true successor was Kickstarted in 2015 and is currently in development by creator Greg Johnson with the release date still to be announced. Even if it can’t be done justice, there’s no overlooking such a unique gem that stands out in the Genesis library and remains as an important milestone in innovating the roguelike genre.Drew DickinsonToeJam & Earl Gameplay (Sega Genesis):Post-punk quartet KLAMMER are releasing their new album ‘You Have Been Processed’ on vinyl, CD and digitally through Under Dogz Records.

      "ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron is a platform video game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega in 1993 for the Sega Genesis. The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth.The game follows on the events of the first game, in which funky aliens ToeJam and Earl crash landed on Earth. After managing to rebuild their spaceship and returning safely to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo soon learn that a bunch of Earthlings had stowed away on their craft and have now invaded Funkotron.[3] With the humans spreading panic across the planet's citizens, even scaring the source of all funk, Lamont the Funkapotomus, away to another dimension, it is up to ToeJam and Earl to clean up the mess they've made and send all the Earthlings they brought with them back to where they came from.After the success of the original game, Johnson Voorsanger Productions began work on a sequel in 1992. The developer spent three to four months building on the original mechanics, adding elements such as indoor areas and additional terrain types, though the randomly generated levels were removed. The plot of this prototype would see ToeJam and Earl \"return to Earth to stage a rap concert, only to find they've lost their CDs\" which would form the basis of the game's treasure hunt. JSSnippetsStack.push({dependencies:[{\"url\":\"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7030077030012/group/-/wikia_photo_gallery_js\",\"type\":\"js\"},{\"url\":\"https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__am/7030077030012/sass/background-dynamic%3D1%26background-image%3D%252Fskins%252Foasis%252Fimages%252Fthemes%252Foasis.png%26background-image-height%3D800%26background-image-width%3D2000%26color-body%3D%2523bacdd8%26color-body-middle%3D%2523bacdd8%26color-buttons%3D%2523006cb0%26color-community-header%3D%2523006cb0%26color-header%3D%25233a5766%26color-links%3D%2523006cb0%26color-page%3D%2523ffffff%26oasisTypography%3D1%26page-opacity%3D100%26widthType%3D0/extensions/wikia/WikiaPhotoGallery/css/gallery.scss\",\"type\":\"css\"}],callback:function(json){WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init(json)},id:\"WikiaPhotoGalleryView.init\"})According to the Johnson and Voorsanger, the game would feature \"more default items\" for the characters to \"use all the time\", new items and characters, and more detail and secret areas allowed by the fixed (rather than randomly generated) levels. The game employed a larger development team than the first installment and was originally projected for a Christmas 1992 release, and titled ToeJam & Earl 2. Sega however conferred that they did not \"understand\" the game and though the \"decision was still ultimately with Johnson and Voorsanger\", the developer started work on a more generic side-scrolling platform game, a concept to which Sega had been more receptive. The increased size of the game's cartridge over the original allowed for greater graphical detail. The soundtrack, including the original theme, was remixed and given a more layered quality.Unlike its predecessor, Panic on Funkotron is a side-scrolling platform game in which up to two players play as ToeJam and Earl as they travel across Funkotron to capture antagonistic Earthlings that had stowed away.[6] Players accomplish this by using a radar to locate an Earthling's proximity (some Earthlings may be hidden in the environment) and attack them with jars in order to trap and collect them. Once all Earthlings have been found, the player can move on to the next level.[7] Players can collect presents containing various bonuses, such as super jars, radar scans, and teleporting moves. Coins can be used with parking meters to trigger events in the environment or participate in minigames such as Jam Outs and Fungus Olympics. Players can also enter gateways leading to the Hyper Funk Zone, where the player must avoid obstacles in order to earn more presents. Hidden throughout the game are ten objects belonging to Lamont the Funkapotamus; collecting all of which will earn the player the best ending upon completion.",
      "ToeJam & Earl (トージャム＆アール) is an action game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions, and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive. It stars two extraterrestrial rappers who, by way of pilot error, end up crash-landing on Earth. While there, they must search for the missing pieces of their spacecraft in hopes of reassembling it. The game frequently parodies and satirizes 1990s urban culture, and includes common 90s slang and a funk soundtrack. Much of this charm is what drew people toward the game. The game was followed by ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron.The game takes place in a surreal isometric world representing Earth, where land is in the form of a stack of randomly-generated floating islands. In each of the game's 25 island, the player must find the elevator that will bring them to the next level. Occasionally, a rocketship piece will be hidden somewhere on an island, although the player is not required to collect it right away before moving onto the next island. Every island besides the first is surrounded by a void, falling in at any time will cause the player to fall to the previous level.Presents are scattered around the island that can be collected and used at any time. The effects of each present box are randomized each time the game is played. Some presents have helpful effects, such as restoring health, temporarily bestowing special abilities, or revealing hidden sections of the map. Others, however, can do more harm, and can do things such as summon enemies, cause the character to fall asleep and leave them open to attack, or randomize the effects of all the presents.While most inhabitants of Earth will attack or otherwise hinder Toejam & Earl when they spot them, some will help them in exchange for money. The man in the carrot suit will identify presents, and the wizard will fully restore a character's health. On occasion, Santa Claus can be found, if the player is successful in sneaking up to him without alerting him, he will drop a few random presents.The player has a rank shown on the bottom of the screen with their health and number of extra lives, and begins the game at the rank of 'Weiner'. As the player scores points by uncovering squares of the map and opening presents, their rank will increase at certain point values. When the player increases in rank, their maximum health increases, and for every second increase in rank, the player receives an extra life. The player is able to increase in rank eight times.The game can either be played with one or two players. In two-player mode, if Toejam & Earl wander too far apart, the game will go into a horizontal split-screen so both players can keep track of their characters, with the screen returning to normal once the characters reunite. If Toejam & Earl walk into each other, they will high-five, causing the player with the most health to give a little to the player with less health. If one player loses all of their lives, they can also take a life from the other player to come back into the game.The game ends when the player finds all 10 pieces of the spacecraft.sneaks and causes a character to use a present's special ability, when applicable.  pulls up an item screen.  switches to a map of the current island.One of Greg Johnson's main influences for the design of ToeJam & Earl, was the video game Rogue[16], a dungeon crawling video game, developed around 1980 for Unix-based mainframe systems and released as public domain software, a game that Greg Johnson first played while studiyng bio-linguistics at the University of California in San Diego, staying up to early hours of the morning playing it.n/aSteam manual#27: \"October 1991\" (1991-xx-xx)#119: \"October 1991\" (1991-09-15)#11: \"September 1993\" (1993-07-30)#9: \"Abril 1992\" (1992-04-xx)Sega Retro is part of the Backwards Compatible family of sites, which are dedicated to research and preservation of gaming history and culture.Donate | Privacy Policy | About Sega Retro | ContactExcept where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.Publisher: SegaDeveloper: Johnson Voorsanger ProductionsSystem(s): Sega Mega Drive, Virtual Console, PlayStation Network, SteamGenre: ActionNumber of players: 1-2Release \n Date \n RRP \n Code\n\n\n  JP \n 1992-03-13 \n ¥6,800 \n G-4066\n\n\n  US \n 1991-10[2][3] \n $59.95[1] \n 1020\n\n\n  CA \n 199x \n $? \n 1020\n\n\n  UK \n 1991-11 \n £34.99[4][5] \n 1020\n\n\n  FR \n 1991-11 \n ?F \n 1020\n\n\n  DE \n 1991-11 \n DM ? \n 1020\n\n\n  ES \n 1991-11 \n ?Ptas \n 1020\n\n\n  AU \n 199x \n $? \n ?\n\n\n  BR \n 199x \n R$? \n ?\n\n\n  KR \n 199x \n ₩? \n GM8027JG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  JP \n 2006-12-02[7] \n 600[6] pts \n ?\n\n\n  US \n 2006-12-25[8] \n 800[8] pts \n ?\n\n\n  EU \n 2006-12-22[9] \n 800[9] pts \n ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  US \n 2011-01-26[11] \n $4.99[10] \n 71166\n\n\n  EU \n 2011-01-26[11] \n €4.49[10] \n 71166\n\n\n  UK \n 2011-01-26[11] \n £3.99[10] \n 71166\n\n\n  AU \n 2011-01-26[11] \n $6.99[10] \n 71166\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  US ▼\n\n 2012-11-06[12]\n\n $4.99[12]\n\n NPUB-30796\n\n\n\n\n  EU ▼\n\n 2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[13]\n\n €4.49[12]\n\n NPEB-01001\n\n\n\n\n  UK ▼\n\n 2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[13]\n\n £3.59[12]\n\n NPEB-01001\n\n\n\n\n  AU ▼\n\n 2012-11-06[12]\n\n $6.25[12]\n\n NPEB-01001\n\n\n\n\n  KR ▼\n\n 2012-11-07[14]\n\n ₩6,200[14]\n\n NPHB-00500\n\n\n\n\n  TW ▼\n\n 2012-11-07[15]\n\n NT$156[15]\n\n NPHB-00500JP1992-03-13¥6,800G-4066US1991-10[2][3]$59.95[1]1020CA199x$?1020UK1991-11£34.99[4][5]1020FR1991-11?F1020DE1991-11DM ?1020ES1991-11?Ptas1020AU199x$??BR199xR$??KR199x₩?GM8027JGJP2006-12-02[7]600[6] pts?US2006-12-25[8]800[8] pts?EU2006-12-22[9]800[9] pts?US2011-01-26[11]$4.99[10]71166EU2011-01-26[11]€4.49[10]71166UK2011-01-26[11]£3.99[10]71166AU2011-01-26[11]$6.99[10]71166US ▼2012-11-06[12]$4.99[12]NPUB-30796EU ▼2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[13]€4.49[12]NPEB-01001UK ▼2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[13]£3.59[12]NPEB-01001AU ▼2012-11-06[12]$6.25[12]NPEB-01001KR ▼2012-11-07[14]₩6,200[14]NPHB-00500TW ▼2012-11-07[15]NT$156[15]NPHB-00500ESRBPEGIOFLCCEROTrivia sections are badTry and incorporate this information into the main article.

      "ToeJam & Earl is an action video game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega for the Sega Genesisvideo game console. Released in 1991, it centers on the titular ToeJam and Earl—alien rappers who have crash-landed on Earth. As they attempt to escape the planet, players assume the role of either character and collect pieces of their wrecked spacecraft. ToeJam & Earl's design was heavily influenced by the role-playing video game Rogue, and took from it such features as the random generation of levels and items. It references and parodies 1980s and early 90s urban culture and is set to a funk soundtrack.",

      "Above: So funky.I’ve been spending time with the recent Sega Genesis Collection on my PlayStation 4. I’ve been having fun going through the games that I’ve never played before, like the Zelda-ish action role-playing game Beyond Oasis. But one of my childhood favorites has monopolized most of my time with the collection.And surprise, it’s not Sonic. I’ve been playing a lot of ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron.Panic on Funkotron is a weird game. It’s a sequel to the original ToeJam & Earl, which came out for the Genesis in 1991. The first game is a roguelike, with two players navigating randomly generating levels with a top-down perspective. But ToeJam & Earl stands out because of its funk-inspired aesthetics and music. I can’t think of any other game or series that looks quite like ToeJam & Earl, which mixes early ’90s funk with Mad Magazine/Ren & Stimpy wacky-gross character designs.Oh, and you play as teenage rapper aliens.ToeJam & Earl is the rare series that stands out because of its style and aesthetics instead of its gameplay. Not to say that the original wasn’t fun. roguelikes were much less common in the early ’90s, and random levels were themselves still a novelty.But the sequel took a different approach. Panic on Funkotron is a 2D side-scroller. This upset many fans of the original. Today, many gamers think that the series abandoning its roguelike elements for a traditional platformer setup symbolized ToeJam & Earl selling out.Which is at least true, from a certain point of view. ToeJam & Earl developer Johnson Voorsanger Productions first started work on a sequel that was much more like the original. But Sega wasn’t impressed. When the studio turned their project into a 2D game, Sega saw something more marketable.But I don’t care about any of that. Panic on Funkotron is the better game.Yes, it went 2D. But it didn’t abandon any of the  weirdness. While the original takes place on Earth, the sequel is set on the duo’s home planet of Funkotron. This colorful, funky world is like acid-fueled marriage between Sesame Street and Dr. Seuss with its weird trees and unusual alien inhabitants. It’s a great setting for a game.And the 2D perspective shows off so much more detail. The top-down camera in the original had to be zoomed out for so players could get a good grasp of their surroundings at all angles. In 2D, we can see much more of the wonderful character designs.Panic on Funkotron is a platformer, but it’s nothing like a Mario or Sonic. It’s kind of like an intense game of hide-and-seek. The premise has humans hitching a ride on ToeJam & Earl’s ship after the events from the first game. Feeling responsible for the human invasion, the duo set out to capture all of the humans in jars and send them to rockets back to Earth. To find them, you need to shake trees and search under manhole covers.It’s not as frustrating as it sounds. A compass points you in the direction of the nearest human, and it also tells you when you’ve captured them all and can move on to the next level.But even outside of this creative base game, Panic in Funkotron has a ton of side activities. You can beat-box and jam with friends in rhythm mini-games, try to impress judges by doing flips off of spongy alien goop, and then you have the Hyperfunk Zone. Ahhh, the Hyperfunk Zone. It was an endless runner before anyone termed the phrase.Panic on Funkotron does have its problems. The platforming is floaty and slow. Sometimes the game wants you to jump on platforms you can’t even see. It can be frustrating. But its creativity still stands out in 2018.A new ToeJam & Earl, Back in the Groove, is coming out later this year. It will play more like the original. I understand. Most people do seem to prefer the first ToeJam & Earl. But Panic on Funkotron will always have my heart, and it deserves a better reputation.The RetroBeat is a weekly column that looks at gaming’s past, diving into classics, new retro titles, or looking at how old favorites — and their design techniques — inspire today’s market and experiences.

      "ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron, called ToeJam & Earl in Panic auf Funkotron in Germany, is the sequel to ToeJam & Earl, and was released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993.Unlike the original game it is a 2D sidescroller set on ToeJam and Earl's home planet, Funkotron. The story picks up after the first game, where after escaping earth the duo find a number of Earthlings have stowed away on their ship, and are now causing mayhem.Johnson Voorsanger Productions had originally planned to make the sequel to ToeJam & Earl much like its predecessor, i.e. a top-down action game as opposed to a sidescroller. Sega of America, however, felt that it would be better as a 2D platformer, so the game was entirely reworked to suit the publisher's needs.The game was eventually followed by ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth for the Xbox.n/aSteam manual#54: \"January 1994\" (199x-xx-xx)#21: \"Enero 1994\" (1994-xx-xx)#14: \"Mayo 1994\" (1994-xx-xx)Sega Retro is part of the Backwards Compatible family of sites, which are dedicated to research and preservation of gaming history and culture.Donate | Privacy Policy | About Sega Retro | ContactExcept where otherwise noted, content on this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.Publisher: SegaDeveloper: Johnson Voorsanger ProductionsSystem(s): Sega Mega Drive, Virtual Console, PlayStation Network, SteamSound driver: GEMSPeripherals supported: Six Button Control PadGenre: ActionNumber of players: 1-2Release \n Date \n RRP \n Code\n\n\n  US \n 1993-12[1] \n $49.99[1] \n 1043\n\n\n  UK \n 1994-01-16 \n £49.99[2] \n 1043\n\n\n  FR \n 1994-01-16 \n ?F \n 1043\n\n\n  DE \n 1994-01-16 \n DM ? \n 1043\n\n\n  ES \n 1994-01-16 \n ?Ptas \n 1043\n\n\n  AU \n 199x \n $? \n ?\n\n\n  BR \n 199x \n R$? \n ?\n\n\n  AS \n 199x \n ? \n ?\n\n\n  KR \n 199x \n ₩? \n GM93048JG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  US \n 2007-06-04[3] \n 800[3] pts \n ?\n\n\n  EU \n 2007-06-01[4] \n 800[4] pts \n ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  US \n 2012-03-14[6] \n $4.99[5] \n 71167\n\n\n  EU \n 2012-03-14[6] \n €4.49[5] \n 71167\n\n\n  UK \n 2012-03-14[6] \n £3.99[5] \n 71167\n\n\n  AU \n 2012-03-14[6] \n $6.99[5] \n 71167\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  US ▼\n\n 2012-11-06[7]\n\n $4.99[7]\n\n NPUB-30797\n\n\n\n\n  EU ▼\n\n 2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[8]\n\n €4.49[7]\n\n NPEB-01008\n\n\n\n\n  UK ▼\n\n 2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[8]\n\n £3.59[7]\n\n NPEB-01008\n\n\n\n\n  AU ▼\n\n 2012-11-06[7]\n\n $6.25[7]\n\n NPEB-01008\n\n\n\n\n  KR ▼\n\n 2012-11-07[9]\n\n ₩6,200[9]\n\n NPHB-00501\n\n\n\n\n  TW ▼\n\n 2012-11-07[10]\n\n NT$156[10]\n\n NPHB-00501US1993-12[1]$49.99[1]1043UK1994-01-16£49.99[2]1043FR1994-01-16?F1043DE1994-01-16DM ?1043ES1994-01-16?Ptas1043AU199x$??BR199xR$??AS199x??KR199x₩?GM93048JGUS2007-06-04[3]800[3] pts?EU2007-06-01[4]800[4] pts?US2012-03-14[6]$4.99[5]71167EU2012-03-14[6]€4.49[5]71167UK2012-03-14[6]£3.99[5]71167AU2012-03-14[6]$6.99[5]71167US ▼2012-11-06[7]$4.99[7]NPUB-30797EU ▼2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[8]€4.49[7]NPEB-01008UK ▼2012-11-07Media:TJ E Release Announcement vFINAL.pdf[8]£3.59[7]NPEB-01008AU ▼2012-11-06[7]$6.25[7]NPEB-01008KR ▼2012-11-07[9]₩6,200[9]NPHB-00501TW ▼2012-11-07[10]NT$156[10]NPHB-00501ESRBVRCPEGIOFLCPublication\n\nScore\n\nSource\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsoles + (FR)\n\n89\n\n №28, p98/99/100\n\n\n\n\nComputer & Video Games (UK)\n\n89\n\n №146, p89[13]\n\n\n\n\nGamePro (US)\n\n95\n\n №53, p88/89[1]\n\n\n\n\nGamesMaster (UK)\n\n90\n\n №13, p68/69/70\n\n\n\n\nNo results\n\n90\n\n №54\n\n\n\n\nJoypad (FR)\n\n84\n\n №27, p110/111\n\n\n\n\nMega (UK)\n\n92\n\n №16, p58/59\n\n\n\n\nMega Action (UK)\n\n87\n\n №9, p18/19\n\n\n\n\nMegaTech (UK)\n\n91\n\n №25\n\n\n\n\nMean Machines Sega (UK)\n\n91\n\n №15, p28-32[14]\n\n\n\n\nPlayer One (FR)\n\n91\n\n №38, p84/85/86\n\n\n\n\nSega Magazine (UK)\n\n88\n\n №1, p104/105[2]\n\n\n\n\nSega Power (UK)\n\n90\n\n №50, p60/61\n\n\n\n\nSega Pro (UK)\n\n93\n\n №28, p58/59\n\n\n\n\nSega Zone (UK)\n\n92\n\n №15, p42/43/44\n\n\n\n\nSonic the Comic (UK)\n\n85\n\n №16, p11\n\n\n\n\nNo results\n\n81Consoles + (FR)89№28, p98/99/100Computer & Video Games (UK)89№146, p89[13]GamePro (US)95№53, p88/89[1]GamesMaster (UK)90№13, p68/69/70No results90№54Joypad (FR)84№27, p110/111Mega (UK)92№16, p58/59Mega Action (UK)87№9, p18/19MegaTech (UK)91№25Mean Machines Sega (UK)91№15, p28-32[14]Player One (FR)91№38, p84/85/86Sega Magazine (UK)88№1, p104/105[2]Sega Power (UK)90№50, p60/61Sega Pro (UK)93№28, p58/59Sega Zone (UK)92№15, p42/43/44Sonic the Comic (UK)85№16, p11No results81Based on17 reviewsCoverCartFile:Toejam And Earl Panic Funkotron MD US Manual.pdfManualCoverCartCoverCartCoverCartCartMain page | Comparisons | Hidden content | Magazine articles | Region codingToeJam & Earl (1991) | ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron (1993)ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth (2002)Sega Vintage Collection: ToeJam & Earl (2012)ToeJam & Earl Rap (1991) | Sega Tunes: ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron (1996)",
      "ZeexlashREVIEWS: Alan Wake / Space Harrier II / ToeJam & Earl / Streets of Rage / Vanquish / Crazy TaxiFEATURES: Remembering WiiWare / Replay Challenge 2018 / The Belfast World Pong ChampionshipMega Drive, 1991 by Johnson Voorsanger Productions.I love a weird game and ToeJam & Earl has to be one of the weirdest out there. Playing as one of the titular, funk-tacular aliens, your goal is to scour 25 vertically-stacked, randomly-generated levels of a planet that is supposedly Earth, to recover the scattered parts of your crashed spaceship.Along the way you’ll encounter some very strange characters – some who are friends and many who are foes – and unwrap presents, which contain items that will help or hinder you.Not knowing what will be inside the gift until you open it is part of the fun of the game, but it can also be frustrating when it sends you suddenly spiraling towards a game over.In fact, not knowing what’ll happen next pretty much is the game. You arrive on the next floor, by way of a lift you have to locate, and all the squares of its map will be blanked out. You’ll be notified if there’s a spaceship part on that floor, now choose a direction and start walking until you find it. After that you’ll need to find the lift to the next floor, which of course could be in the complete opposite side of the map – luckily there are stretches of tarmac to help guide you to the exit point.Some stages have large bodies of water while others have quicksand; some consist of narrow stretches of land connected by ‘bridges’ that only reveal themselves when you get close. It’s always interesting to see what the game will throw your way next, though there are obviously rules at play and some recurring terrain formations which you’ll notice. You can spend a lot of time exploring a corner of a map, contending with some menacing enemies, only to find there’s nothing there – but of course, you have to check.So if all of that sounds more like a chore than a good time then ToeJam & Earl is probably not the game for you. It demands patience, a bit of planning and more than a little luck. It’s played at a very slow pace, thanks to the unhurried, swaggering walk speed of its two characters, who are distinguished only because ToeJam walks a little faster, while Earl has a little more health. There’s a brilliant and innovative two player mode with split screen, to allow you and a friend to go off and explore in different directions to share the workload, but it’s perfectly manageable in single player mode too. There’s also a mode without randomly-generated stages, if you happen to be – as the game might put it – a ‘total downer’.The sheer variety of presents you can find is really impressive and their functions are  clever and often hilarious – some function as one-off gags that exist purely for the sake of a joke, others can pretty much single-handedly make or break your game if you get them at a particular time. There are rocket boots, pogo sticks and wings to help you get around faster, a slingshot to fire tomatoes at foes and the ‘unfall’, which warps you back up if you fall off the edge of a stage. But then there’s also the rain cloud, which causes you to be repeatedly electrocuted by lightning, and a book which makes you fall asleep (because reading isn’t for cool kids, take note). Once you venture to open a present, all other ones that look like it will give you the same gift – unless you open a ‘randomizer’, which resets all of this – it can be a blessing or an absolute nightmare!And while much of ToeJam & Earl is unashamedly random-chance based, the difficulty progression is not – the later floors really ramp up the density of hazards and some of the tougher enemies are best avoided. Meanwhile the intrepid, experimental spirit you may have taken on the lower levels quickly gives way to a far more cautious approach, knowing one wrong move could spell the end.Managing which items you use, which you hold and which you discard becomes very important and intensely strategic – well, at least for a game where you buy hints from a man dressed as a carrot – but there’s often only so much you can do to mitigate the harsher fates that can befall you. It hurts to fail, after sinking an hour or more into a run, because you’ve been trapped in a dead end by one of the more powerful, rampaging enemies. Sometimes it feels like the game can be a little too cruel.The audio and visual presentation of ToeJam & Earl is totally unique, and if you like it – as I do – then all is good, but if you don’t, well you’re stuck with it for the duration because it doesn’t change. Floor one effectively looks the same as floor 25: grassy green land with a few grey roads strewn across it and the odd blue or yellow spillage, set against the black backdrop of outer space. A bit more variety wouldn’t go amiss. The soundtrack meanwhile consists of only a handful of songs and is incessantly catchy, with sparse beats and funky melodies that will have you humming along as you wander around the sprawling maps. Again, if you don’t like it at the start, your ears are in for a bumpy ride.Maps and inventory screens are well designed too and simple enough to navigate via the three buttons of the Mega Drive pad, and I like how they’re decorated with random squiggles in keeping with the game’s colourful, 80s aesthetic. The main stats bar keeps track of your character’s progression through a variety of dope titles such as ‘weiner’ and ‘dude’, all the way up to the ultimate accolade of ‘funk lord’, which is pointless but pretty funny.While this was ToeJam & Earl’s first and most successful adventure – with the duo at one stage considered Sega mascots, alongside the likes of Sonic the Hedgehog and Alex Kidd – its highly original and downright odd format didn’t stick for the sequel, which ended up being a comparatively straight 2D platformer. That game, which isn’t bad at all, proved to be their last for many years, though a Kickstarter-backed revival is on the way, headed up by Greg Johnson who co-developed the original. I’m looking forward to that one. In the meantime, if you like its style and can tolerate a brutal setback or two, ToeJam & Earl is still absolutely worth checking out.FINAL GRADE: [C]Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )You are commenting using your Google+ account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )You are commenting using your Twitter account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )You are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )Connecting to %sNotify me of new comments via email.Keep this knowledge in your heart and mind.",

      "ToeJam & Earl is a surreal-comedic action-adventure roguelike developed by JVP and published by Sega for the Genesis on July 21, 1991. The game stars two bodaciously funky alien rappers (three-legged red ToeJam and fat orange Earl) as they explore various floating islands (representing Earth) in order to find pieces of their wrecked spacecraft.The game received two sequels: ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron (a 1993 side-scrolling platformer for the Genesis) and ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth (a 2002 action-adventure platformer for the Xbox). The original game was re-released on the Wii (via Wii Virtual Console) on December 22, 2006 and both the Xbox 360 (via an Xbox Live Arcade compilation) and PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) on November 7, 2012 (as part of the Sega Vintage Collection series).The entire game revolves around collecting presents, gathering ship pieces, and fighting or avoiding enemies. In this surreal world, Earth consists of hundreds of suspended grass platforms in space, sometimes containing water or sand. The levels are scattered with Earthlings, who, without an offensive weapon at the aliens' disposal, must be avoided at any cost.The game has two modes. In the first, \"Fixed Mode\", all the levels are pre-created and will be the same every time the game is played. In \"Random Mode\", the levels are all randomly generated and populated with presents, earthlings, and ship pieces. This was one of the first games to popularize randomly generated levels. The game also featured a revolutionary version of split screen mode, where both characters would be on the same screen, but when far enough apart the screen would split, allowing each to continue on their way. The screen would then become a single one when the characters got close enough again.The main goal is to collect all the pieces of ToeJam and Earl's ship. Once done, they launch off to their home planet and win the game. The player also wants to collect as many presents and cover as much of the map as possible. Covering map blocks and opening/identifying presents will net points, which allow ToeJam and Earl to level up. The player progresses through the stages by getting into elevators scattered across the levels.In co-op, when Toe Jam and Earl walk past each other perfectly they give each other a high five. Doing so averages out both players' health bars, which is especially useful if one is near death.Earth is generally avoided by the intelligent races of the galaxy, as it has been conclusively proven that most Earthlings are completely out of their minds. Earthlings are scattered throughout the game, appearing more frequently on the higher levels, which also contain the more powerful enemies. In a fashion completely unique to this game, most enemy encounters are solved by simply escaping them. Since ToeJam and Earl mostly walk (unless they have a set of Super Hi-Tops active), they will have to walk in certain patterns to avoid enemy attacks or paths. Some presents will allow them to throw tomatoes as projectiles at the enemies to defeat them, but given the occurrence of these presents in the game world, it serves as more of a power-up than a primary weapon. Less common are the helpful Earthlings, who may perform a service for some bucks.If the player collects two inner tubes, two pairs of rocket skates, two sets of Icarus wings, or any combination of those items equaling 2 or more, they can access either of the secret islands on level 1. The first, Present Island, is in the upper right corner of level 1. It is literally covered with presents.The second, Level 0, is a secret area that can be accessed by falling through a hole in the lower left corner of level 1. On level 0, the player character can drink from a lemonade stand for an extra life, or chat up some babes in a hot tub, which will heal all wounds. To get back to the highest level the player was on, jumping off the side of the Level 0 will let them fall back to it.While playing the game, opening and revealing presents along with revealing more and more of the map will level up the player. Each present opened earns 2 points while each square revealed earns 1. Gaining a level will result in an increase to the player's life bar and in some cases will grant extra lives. Here are the following levels with corresponding point requirements:This game includes a beat machine with which the player could make beats with different drums and sound effects.You can search for\n     any Giant Bomb content.You can search for\n     any Giant Bomb content.Enter the URL for the tweet you want to embed.5.0 stars\n5.0 Stars\n      Average score of 1 user reviewsUntil you earn 1000 points all your submissions need to be vetted by other\n        Giant Bomb users.

      "Make yourself known:In contrast to its predecessor, ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron took the form of a side-scrolling platform game. In this game, it is revealed that a number of Earthlings hitchhiked on ToeJam and Earl’s spaceship on their trip back home after the first game, and are now infesting Funkotron. ToeJam and Earl must capture the Earthlings in jars, and ship them back to Earth. A side-mission is to find ten beloved objects of Lamont the “Funkapotamus”, the source of all funk in the universe, to persuade him to return to Funkotron.ToeJam and Earl’s primary method of capturing the escaped earthlings is through the use of jars. The characters have an unlimited amount of these at their disposal.Released: 1993Publisher: SegaDeveloper: Johnson Voorsanger ProductionsSubmitted by: John MyersRetro Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

    "title": "Diablo",
    "text": [
      "Diablo  is an action role-playing hack and slash video game developed by Blizzard North and released by Blizzard Entertainment on December 31, 1996.Set in the fictional Kingdom of Khanduras, located in the mortal realm, Diablo has the player take control of a lone hero battling to rid the world of Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Beneath the town of Tristram, the player journeys through sixteen randomly generated dungeon levels, ultimately entering Hell itself in order to face Diablo.\nAn expansion pack, entitled Diablo: Hellfire, was released in 1997 by Sierra Entertainment. In 1998, Electronic Arts released Diablo for the PlayStation. This version featured direct control of the main character using the PlayStation controller and was developed by Climax Studios. A Sega Saturn version was also considered by Electronic Arts but never released. The game's success led to two sequels, Diablo II in 2000, and Diablo III in 2012. To celebrate Diablo's 20th anniversary, a quest entitled \"The Darkening of Tristram\", was added in Diablo III in early 2017.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDiablo is an action role-playing hack and slash video game. The player moves and interacts with the environment primarily by way of a mouse. Other actions, such as casting a spell, are performed in response to keyboard inputs. The player can acquire items, learn spells, defeat enemies, and interact with non-player characters (NPC)s throughout the game.\nThe dungeon levels are randomly generated, although they follow parameters according to their type; for instance the catacombs tend to have long corridors and closed rooms, while the caves are more non-linear. The players are assigned a random number of quests from several tiers; these quests are optional but help to level up the character and/or reveal more of the backstory. The final two quests, however, are mandatory in order to finish the game.\n\n\n=== Classes ===\n\nDiablo has three character classes: the Warrior, the Rogue, and the Sorcerer. Each class has a different level of assigned attributes along with a unique skill. Each class is capable of using almost all of the same items and spells, in contrast to later titles in the Diablo series which have class-specific items and spells. However, the limitations in the attributes for each class reward play that utilizes them efficiently; for instance the Warrior's low maximum level of Magic prevents him from learning the higher levels of powerful spells like the Sorcerer, instead the Warrior is best suited to melee with a faster weapon swing plus a \"critical strike\" for bonus damage.\n\nWarrior: The most physically able of the three classes. The Warrior is a close-quarters fighter and can generally take the most physical punishment. The Warrior's primary character attribute is Strength. The Warrior starts with the skill to repair objects in his possession at the cost of overall durability.\nRogue: A master of ranged weapons. While not as strong as the Warrior, the rogue is very effective at attacking enemies from a distance with the bow. The Rogue's primary character attribute is Dexterity. The Rogue's unique starting skill is the ability to disarm traps.\nSorcerer: A spellcaster being the most physically weak of the three classes, but can learn the most spells at the highest levels. The Sorcerer's primary character attribute is Magic. The Sorcerer's unique starting skill is the ability to recharge spell staves at the cost of lowering the maximum number of spell charges that the staff can hold.In the expansion set, Diablo: Hellfire, the Monk was added. The Monk was meant to be proficient at melee combat with the staff, and is not related to the Monk class in Diablo III. Two other classes, the Bard and Barbarian, were unfinished but remained hidden characters in Diablo: Hellfire, and could be enabled using a hack. Using the in-game sprites of the Rogue and Warrior, respectively, the Bard is capable of dual-wielding weapons while the Barbarian was a two-handed axe specialist.\n\n\n=== Items ===\nMany items have attribute minimums to be used effectively. White-colored items are normal items, blue-colored items are magic items and gold-colored items are unique items. Any items that are not white in color must be identified to make use of their magical effects, however, characters can use unidentified items as they would the base item. Items wear down through use and only have a certain amount of durability. When an item's durability is zero, it is destroyed. Players can return to the town and pay a fee to an NPC, Griswold the Blacksmith, to have the items restored, while the Warrior can repair objects in his possession at the cost of overall durability.Bows are the ranged weapon of the game, best used by rogues. Staves, while capable of physical attacks, are mainly used for the spell charges that they contain, as casting from a staff does not require the player to learn the spell or use mana. A staff's spell can only be cast a certain number of times before it requires a recharge. Swords are typically one-handed (though two-handed varieties also exist), while axes are all two-handed. Maces and clubs add a 50% damage bonus against the undead. Shields, when paired with single-handed weapons, allow attacks to be blocked. There are three classifications of armor: light, medium and heavy. Characters are also allowed to wear a helmet, two rings, and one amulet.Books contain spell formulas. Spell books cannot be used more than once, but multiple books of the same spell will increase the spell level, up to a maximum of 15. Scrolls allow use of both spells not yet learned, and spells not available in book form. They vanish after one use. Many potions are available for use, including health and mana restoration, and elixirs that increase statistics.\n\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nMultiplayer can be done with up to four players. Multiplayer characters' states are saved periodically. Players can either be aggressive towards, or play co-operatively with, other players. Players can connect by one of the following: direct connection, modem connection, Battle.net connection or IPX network connection. The game lacks the stronger anti-cheating methods of Blizzard's later games and as a result, many characters online have been altered in various ways by common third-party programs known as trainers and/or game editing programs such as Cheat Engine.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe setting of Diablo includes the mortal realm which is the world of Man as well as the High Heavens and the Burning Hells.:61, 62, 64 & 72 After eons of war between angels and demons, the ascension of man prompted the three Lords of Hell (including Diablo himself) to seek victory through influence, prompting their exile into the mortal realm. There, they sowed chaos, distrust, and hatred among the humans of Sanctuary until a group of magi, called the Horadrim, trapped them in enchanted crystals called \"Soulstones\". Diablo's soulstone was buried deep in the earth and a monastery was built over the site.\nGenerations passed and the purpose of the monastery was forgotten. A small town named Tristram sprang up next to the monastery's ruins. When King Leoric rebuilt the monastery as a cathedral, Diablo manipulated its archbishop, Lazarus, to destroy his soulstone prison. Diablo subsequently possessed the king, sending out his knights and priests to battle against peaceful kingdoms, and then possessed the king's son, Prince Albrecht, filling the caves and catacombs beneath the cathedral with creatures formed from the young boy's nightmares.\nTristram became a town of fear and horror, where people were abducted in the night. With no king, no law, and no army left to defend them, many villagers fled.\n\n\n=== Story ===\nThe game starts when the player's character arrives in Tristram. Several of the remaining townsfolk assist the player such as Deckard Cain the Elder. The labyrinth under the Cathedral descends from the dungeon/church, to the catacombs, followed by the caves, and finally Hell itself, each with a mixture of the undead, animals, and demons. Leoric has been re-animated as the Skeleton King.\nLate in the game, the hero must fight Archbishop Lazarus, and eventually Diablo himself. At the end of the game, the hero kills Diablo's mortal form. The hero then takes the Soulstone out of Diablo's forehead after which Diablo transforms into a lifeless Prince Albrecht. The hero then drives the Soulstone into his/her own forehead, and he or she contains the essence of Diablo within himself or herself.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nDiablo was conceived by David Brevik during the development of the fighting game Justice League Task Force (1995), developed by Japanese studio Sunsoft with two American studios, Condor Games (later Blizzard North) on the Sega Genesis version and Silicon & Synapse (soon renamed Blizzard Entertainment) on the SNES version. Condor, Brevik's studio, was initially unaware of the SNES version, but eventually became acquainted with that version's co-developer Blizzard, who they found to have a similar interest in PC gaming. Condor's proposal for Diablo, then a turn-based role-playing video game, was turned down by other publishers on the grounds that \"RPGs are dead\" before Blizzard took an interest after pitching the idea to them in January 1995. Blizzard, coming off the success of real-time strategy Warcraft: Orcs & Humans (1994), requested two major changes, to make it real-time and to have multiplayer. Brevik also designed a \"modern and cool\" interface intended to bring the quick directness of console games as well as Doom (1993) to computer RPGs. During development, Condor was eventually renamed Blizzard North. The basis of Diablo was the 1980s roguelike game Moria; Bill Roper later said that the team's \"initial pitch, in a nutshell, was to take the excitement and randomness of games like Moria, Nethack, and Rogue, and bring them into the 1990s with fantastic graphics and sound\". The switch from turn-based to real-time gameplay occurred roughly six months into production.According to Matt Barton, the game Telengard, released by Avalon Hill in 1982, influenced the development of Diablo. Barton and Bill Loguidice also cite The Legend of Zelda series as an influence on Diablo, particularly its move towards real-time action, away from the stat-heavy, turn-based gameplay of earlier computer RPGs.At first, Diablo was a turn-based role-playing game, but later in development, also influenced by the previous success of Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, they decided to make it a real-time action game. The game was also originally conceived to be made in claymation (much like ClayFighter), but they decided to have a 3D isometric style instead.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe music of Diablo was composed by Matt Uelmen. The soundtrack consists of six tracks. It was released after 15 years, in 2011.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nDiablo normally requires the original CD to play, however also included on the disk is a shareware version of the software that could be played without the CD called Diablo Spawn. This version of the game allows access to the first two areas of the dungeon, and locks out two of the three playable classes and many of the NPC townsfolk. It is playable in both single- and multi-player with those restrictions. The demo is also downloadable.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Sales ===\nAccording to Max Schaefer, Blizzard's initial sales estimates for Diablo were modest. He remarked, \"We were thinking that if everything went well, we would sell 100,000 copies.\" Following the game's positive press coverage before its release, estimates by the team were increased to roughly 500,000 copies, David Brevik later said. Pre-orders had surpassed 450,000 units globally by December 17, at which point the game was set to launch with a shipment of 500,000 units staggered across its initial days on shelves. Diablo debuted at #1 on PC Data's monthly computer game sales chart for January 1997. It held the position for another three months, before being displaced to #2 by X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter in May. Diablo remained in second place until September, when it dropped to fifth. It exited the top 10 that October.In the United States, the game was the highest-selling computer title of the first six months of 1997. Its worldwide sales surpassed 500,000 units by April, 750,000 by June and 1 million by late November. By the end of 1997, Diablo had sold 670,155 copies in the United States alone. It was declared the country's fourth-best-selling computer game of the year by PC Data. Schaefer attributed the game's success in part to its December 27 shipment date, and noted that \"there weren't any other games released after Christmas, so we were the only game in town for a long time.\"After being absent from PC Data's charts during the final months of 1997, Diablo took 13th place in the rankings for February 1998. It remained in the top 20 for another month, dropped out in April and reappeared in June. It returned to the top 10 from July through October, rising to #3 in August. For the first half of 1998, it was the United States' 14th-best-selling computer release. At the time, Jason Ocampo of Computer Games Strategy Plus called Diablo one of the charts' \" 'perennial' inhabitants\", and compared its longevity to that of Myst and NASCAR Racing 2. The game's average sale price during the January–June period was $36; by October, it had fallen to $26. Diablo finished 11th for the year in the United States, with sales of 354,961 units and revenues of $9.57 million in the region.Diablo's global sales reached almost 2 million units by September 1998. One year later, its sales in the United States alone had grown to 1.17 million copies, which made it the country's seventh-highest computer game seller since January 1993. This number rose to 1.3 million copies by March 2000. Remarking upon these sales, GameSpot's writer Desslock hailed Diablo as an \"undisputed commercial blockbuster\". The game returned in 2000 to PC Data's annual top 20 for the United States, with 260,020 copies sold.Worldwide, Diablo broke 2 million sales by mid-2000 and reached 2.3 million by January of the next year. Ultimately, the game sold over 2.5 million units by mid-2001.\n\n\n=== Critical reviews ===\nDiablo has received critical acclaim, with an average rating of 94 on Metacritic. Most praised the game's addictive gameplay, randomly generated dungeons, superior graphics, moody musical score, and great variety of possible magic items, enemies, levels, and quests. This last aspect was noted by GameSpot editor Trent Ward in his review: \"Similarly, although a set number of monsters is included, only a few will be seen during each full game. This means that players going back for their second or third shot at the game will very likely fight opponents they haven't seen before. Talk about replay value.\"Reviewers commonly cited the online multiplayer aspect as one of the strongest points of the game, with it being described as greatly extending its replay value. Columnist Bernard Yee commented that compared to contemporary online multiplayer games such as Quake, Diablo gives newcomers a much better chance of enjoying themselves, as they can either cooperate with other players or build their character so that they can hold their own against hostile players. Computer Games Magazine's Cindy Yans said that \"weapons, armor and items are so numerous that you're always acquiring something new to try... not to mention the game's multiplayer universe\"; she went on to say that \"for anyone who enjoys a good multiplayer dungeon crawl, Diablo can't be beat\". Yans finished her review, \"Despite the rather pale storyline, [...] watered-down quests and a fair amount of necessary repetition, Diablo is a must for anyone interested in 'just plain fun.'\" Ward stated: \"Diablo is the best game to come out in the past year, and you should own a copy. Period.\"Macworld's Michael Gowan wrote, \"The only downside to this role-playing game is that the adventure ends too soon.\" Steve Klett's review for PC Games, which was reprinted in sister magazine GamePro, commented that \"Diablo's definitely not your typical dungeon hackfest. ... In fact, its closest rivals are games like Gauntlet and Loaded on the PlayStation, but they really don't compare.\" A Next Generation critic similarly remarked that Diablo is more of a modern incarnation of Gauntlet than an RPG, \"but with enough changes and improvements to make it a completely new experience, and one of the best titles so far this year.\"Diablo won the overall \"Game of the Year\" awards of Computer Gaming World, GameSpot and Computer Game Entertainment for 1996, and was a runner-up for Computer Games Strategy Plus's award in this category. The editors of Computer Gaming World wrote, \"For this year, Diablo is the game that everyone will remember.\" It was also named 1996's best computer role-playing game by GameSpot, Computer Game Entertainment and Computer Games. While it was nominated for Computer Gaming World's \"Role-Playing Game of the Year\" award, the publication gave the honor to The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2005 GameSpot chose Diablo as one of \"The Greatest Games of All Time\". It was placed at No. 20 on Game Informer's \"Top 100 RPGs Of All Time\" list.The official expansion pack made for Diablo was Diablo: Hellfire in 1997. The expansion was produced by Sierra Entertainment rather than an in-house Blizzard North development team. The multiplayer feature of the expansion pack was disabled with version 1.01. The added content included two additional dungeon segments located within a new side storyline, several unique items and magical item properties, spells, and a fourth class, the Monk. There are also two unfinished \"test\" classes (the Bard and Barbarian) and two quests which could be accessed only through a configuration file modification.\nBlizzard sold exclusive worldwide rights to develop, publish, and distribute console versions of the game to Electronic Arts in 1996. In 1998, a PlayStation version of Diablo was released, developed by Climax Studios and published by Electronic Arts. The game lacked online play, but featured a two-player cooperative mode. Notable differences to the PC version include the auto-aiming for range weapons and spells and an option for increased game speed. It features an option to learn the story through a narrator without having to find the books in the game. The European PAL version is fully translated and dubbed into French, German and Swedish in addition to the original English. The PlayStation version was infamous because of its need for 10 blocks on a PlayStation memory card; the standard size of memory cards for the platform was 15 blocks.\nThe game was re-released alongside Hellfire in a 1998 bundle, called Diablo + Hellfire. 1998's Blizzard's Game of the Year Collection contained copies of Diablo, StarCraft and Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness. The Blizzard Anthology (2000) contained Diablo, StarCraft, StarCraft: Brood War and WarCraft II: Battle.net Edition. The Diablo Gift Pack (2000) contained Diablo and Diablo II, but no expansions. The Diablo: Battle Chest (2001) contained Diablo, Diablo II and Diablo II's expansion, Lord of Destruction. Later releases of the Diablo: Battle Chest also have a strategy guide for Diablo II and Lord of Destruction, though subsequent releases do not include the original game, instead featuring Diablo II, its expansion, and their respective strategy guides.\nFor Diablo's 20th anniversary, it was announced during BlizzCon 2016 that Diablo III would receive a free patch called The Darkening of Tristram that recreates the original game. The patch contains a 16-level dungeon, four main bosses from the 1996 version and special graphics filters and 8-directions limited movement like the original game. The test patch was released on November 11, 2016 on the Public Test Realm server.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
      "By\nAndy Chalk\n2016-05-11T23:51:53.131ZWe learned some interesting things about the seminal action-RPG Diablo at this year's GDC, thanks to a talk by David Brevik, co-founder of Blizzard North and senior designer and lead programmer on the game. For instance, Battle.net, the heart and soul of all things Blizzard, originally ran on a single PC, and Diablo itself was initially conceived as a complex, turn-based game, before evolving—against Brevik's vision—into an action-RPG.We covered a few highlights of the talk, as you can see above, but there's nothing better than the real thing, and today the GDC folks posted Brevik's full talk on YouTube. He starts off with a brief recounting of how the name was actually inspired by Mount Diablo in the San Francisco Bay area, which he lived near as a teenager, and then moves into the nuts-and-bolts of the game's creation, from the early design doc—which you can see here—to the final days of crunch that led into the game's launch. He also shows off some footage of the alpha demo, which while very clearly Diablo, was nonetheless a good bit different from what was ultimately released, and touches on a few of the ideas cooked up by the “strike team,” some of which were clearly better than others.It's a fairly lengthy video, clocking in at well over an hour, but a fun watch, especially if you have an interest in the intricacies of game design.

      "Blizzard North was a game developer studio located in San Mateo, in Northern California that created Diablo I , Diablo II and Diablo II: Lord of Destruction.Development on Diablo III was begun at Blizzard North in 2000, and continued (through many rough spots) until 2005, when Blizzard North was shut down. Diablo III's development was restarted almost from scratch at Blizzard Irvine in late 2005, by an almost entirely new development team, and it has continued from there.See the Diablo III History article and the article on Blizzard North's Diablo III for many more details.Blizzard North became part of Blizzard Entertainment after Blizzard purchased Condor Inc, the game design company created by Dave Brevik, Erich Schaefer, and Max Schaefer, the creators of Diablo I.Blizzard North produced Diablo I, Diablo II, and Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. After the release of D2X in 2001 they continued working on two unannounced projects, one of them Diablo III.Delays and problems ensued, the \"Big Four\" (Bill Roper, plus the three company founders; David Brevik, Max Schaefer, and Erich Schaefer.) left in early 2003 to form Flagship Studios, and Blizzard North ultimately closed in summer 2005, without ever announcing, much less releasing, another game.Almost all the remaining employees of Blizzard North were offered contracts at Blizzard Irvine, and while some took those jobs, most quit and looked for work at other game developers in the Bay Area.Though Blizzard has never made any official comment on the changes to the project during development, some unofficial info surfaced in 2010 and 2011. Screenshots (allegedly) from the Blizzard North version surfaced in February 2011, showing levels set in the High Heavens[1]. A couple of months later, Max Schaefer revealed in a podcast interview[2] that work was underway on Diablo III when he left the company in 2003, and that the early plans were for an MMORPG, with a setting similar to that of Diablo II (and not in the High Heavens, indicating that design came in after 2003).According to various insider accounts, virtually none of the early work completed on Diablo 3 remains in the current version, which was begun almost entirely from scratch by a new team in Irvine in 2005. Bill Roper discussed this in an interview in early 2009.

      "﻿Comments are closed.I’ve been gone a while but I come back with what I can say is the biggest interview I’ve ever had, both in word count and the interview itself: Former game director for Diablo 3, Jay Wilson. I reached out to Jay after I noticed him talking about the game on twitter after a long hiatus. It felt like a long shot, and I understood any hesitation in talking about the franchise, however to my surprise he agreed. Due to length I’ll be breaking it up into five parts and making the whole interview viewable as one after that.  What follows is a candid, introspective look at the genesis of D3 and the man behind it.I’ve been playing video games almost as long as there have been video games. Childhood is a blur of Atari, arcades, Commodore, and the NES. Most of my life I’ve been a big fan of action, strategy, and sandboxes where I can wreak havoc. Here are some of the games that had a big impact on me:Starflight 2 – The scale of it blew my little mind. Explore a galaxy, land on planets, interact with aliens, and eventually go back in time and see what the galaxy looked like in the past. On top of that you built and progressed your ship and your crew. Few games do so much, and I remember it doing it all pretty well for the time.Populous – First strategy game that made a big impression on me.Tie Fighter – For the campaign, and for being the first game that really made me feel like I was ‘in’ the Star Wars universe.X-com (original) – I love turn-based squad strategy, but I also loved the completely open metagame of worldwide base management, and the theme. If I had to pick a favorite game of all time this is it.Doom – I played Doom for countless hours. It was really a revolution in what games could accomplish. Making levels for Doom as a hobby was how I got into the game industry.Magic Carpet – A theme I’m starting to notice with this list is I always loved games that redefined my sense of scope and possibility. Magic Carpet did that in spades. The first time I created an earthquake that destroyed the terrain for what felt like miles I was hooked.Diablo – First RPG I played that combined my love of action games while putting me directly into the dungeon. For me it immersed me in the world even more than Ultima Underworld (which was also awesome). I also loved the more grounded fantasy. Just people and demons and squigglies (bad things that aren’t demons).Starcraft – This is really the game that got me heavily into the RTS genre, and eventually I got a job making them.City of Heroes – First MMO I really liked, primarily because it gave me a sense of real power. Most MMO’s you fought really tiny, unimpressive stuff early on, and the combat was very slow. I also love superheroes.World of Warcraft – First MMO I played like it was a job.Minecraft – Mostly heavily modded, but I actively avoid playing it now because when I do all other life events get put on hold, except maybe eating.Honorable mentions: Pools of Radiance, Mechwarrior, Outlaws, Fallout 1-4, Fire Emblem, Advance Wars, the new X-com games.I joined in 2006 (January 2nd, an easy start date to remember) as the Lead Designer of Diablo 3. There was a small team of devs from Blizzard North, some very solid tech, and a lot of existing work, but it was my job to work with the team to decide what Diablo 3 was going to look like. My mandate was pretty broad. I was not required to do anything other than to figure out what the next Diablo should be, but I’m fairly pragmatic so we tried to pull forward as much content and technology as possible.Working at Blizzard is a blessing from a learning and possibility perspective. It made me a much better designer and leader. I got to work with a team that could accomplish pretty much anything I could imagine, and whenever we had a deadline, especially a public one, the team always came together and accomplished amazing things. I was so lucky to be able to spend time with the other Game Directors, who are some of the best and smartest people I know. Blizzard’s people really are top-notch in both talent and just flat out being wonderful people to know.I always really enjoyed Blizzcon, especially the Q&A’s. I like talking about Diablo because it’s one of my favorite things, so doing it with thousands of people was pretty awesome. The Demon Hunter unveil trailer as well as the original announcement were also favorites.Internally the first time we showed the game to the company with the ‘new’ art style was a big turning point. Before then we’d gotten good, but not ecstatic response when we showed the game internally. After we showed it with the new art style, which is pretty close to the look the game shipped with, it was like night and day. Everyone in the company seemed to buzz about what we were doing and the general feeling was we were on the right track.Lowlights: I’m going to avoid the typical stuff. Everyone reading this hopefully knows that things like Error 37 and the Auction House sucked, and were unfortunate issues, but honestly those things were transitory compared to the longer term stresses.Running a project for seven, nearly eight years, is grueling. There is a lot of time for self-doubt. Imposter syndrome was huge. From the day I started until the day I left I kept waiting for security to show up, tell me there had been a mistake, and escort me out.As the Game Director you’re also the guy who has to say no…all the time…to everyone. Everyone has ideas, and lots of them are great, but not all are possible or compatible with the game being made. As a result you’re constantly crapping on people’s ideas, which doesn’t feel great, and feeds right back into the self-doubt stuff.The truth was, though, if I quit then Diablo 3 might not have happened, and I couldn’t live with that, so I never doubted that I should continue.That it’s an all-powerful position. That you snap your fingers and everything moves in the direction you say it should move in. It’s not just making a game, it’s also inspiring and directing a large team, and balancing lots of priorities against one another. There are changes that some of the public asked for that I could have never gotten out of the team even if I wanted them. As Game Director you spend a lot of your time trying to herd everyone’s individual talents and instincts into a cohesive whole. You have to take advantage of the talents of the people you hire, and be aware of their strengths and weaknesses.The people at Blizzard are stunningly talented and it’s really worth getting their input. They are amazing people, and can do amazing things, but if they are a square peg then you will spend a lot of time, and you will make them very unhappy, forcing them into a round hole, even if that round hole is really really really what you want. (As much as I knew and I tried not to make this mistake, at times I definitely did.) When you do this to your people you won’t get the best work out of them, and at Blizzard the best work is always what is needed.Similar to this idea is that the game director designs everything, which is far from the truth. Game Directors often design less than any other designer on the team due to all the other pulls on their time. But ultimately as GD you are responsible for it all, so maybe that’s the same difference.Every game is different, and every team/leader has a different approach. For me my approach is: Brainstorm, Pillars, Prototype, Production, Polish.When I started on Diablo 3 we had over a month of brainstorm meetings that the entire team was invited and encouraged to attendto. We discussed every possible topic we could think of. This was the chance for everyone to get their ideas in, and for me to take the temperature of the kind of game the team wants to make. During this time we also studied and played other games in the genre, especially Diablo 1 and 2. I spent countless hours dissecting Diablo 2 in particular, right down to playing through multiple times with a stopwatch so I could get an average of how quickly different kinds of items showed up, how often new monsters were encountered, frequency of environment changes, etc.Pillars is the point where you lay down the most important core values you live by. Diablo 3 had seven, and I’ve covered them in the past, but they focus on things like replayability, itemization, and co-op. The goal is to provide guide posts to make future decisions by, and give the team an idea of what we’re making. I’m a big believer in a small number of project-wide pillars, as well as very important systems, like class design, having their own subset of pillars.Prototype is taking a small slice of the game and building it to prove concepts and allow you to iterate until you ‘get it’ and it’s exciting and fun. Production is once you ‘get it’ you start building it in earnest. Polish is once you’ve got a lot of stuff built you play and improve it.At most companies each one of those steps is chronological. When I was at Blizzard, prototyping, production, and polish weare repeated over and over, because we were willing to throw out ideas we weren’t happy with. Two good examples: we threw out a lot of environment and character art when we changed art style mid-project, and I can’t tell you how many times we re-did the skill system.The whole goal of the interview was to peel back the veil of Blizzard and hear the real human stories behind them. Jay opens up about the Auction house and revitalizing the franchise in our next part.great guy , pitty the (D3)haters wanted this guy gone !!One can be a freakin’ amazing, great guy and still make a shitty game. It’s a pity you can’t see that.Oh come on. It was still a hugely successful game. People just like to shit on it because it’s “their” game and he didn’t make it exactly how they wanted it. Grow up. He made a very good game but sadly it wasn’t what most people spent the last decade hoping for. And I guarantee d3 is better than anything that brevik twat will ever make.i so agree !!!!! +1No, people don’t like to “shit” on it because it’s “their” game. It was not “hugely successful.” It isn’t anywhere near as good a game as Diablo 2 was/is, but it has gotten a great deal better in the last couple of years of patches.  It was widely disliked by many millions of people who expressed their legitimate concerns on the forums and on this site, and waving your hand dismissing their valid points (like that “erg” moron) also on this site (who has to be all of maybe 15 years old and who also probably hasn’t even played Diablo 2 in his life) is really shitty to do to a lot of people just because you disagree with it.the game was hugely successful in terms of moneybut not in terms of fan appreciationwhich seems very contradictory“He made a very good game”then why has so much changed since the release ?Blizzard has admitted D3 wasn’t very goodhttp://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/118274-Blizzard-Admits-Diablo-III-End-Game-Failurehttp://techland.time.com/2013/03/28/diablo-3-director-admits-auction-houses-really-hurt-game/http://www.pcgamer.com/diablo-iii-interview-lead-designers-reflect-on-their-mistakes-look-ahead-to-reaper-of-souls/It is hard to meke on Blizzard South a Blizzard North game. Jay did a great job there. Even D3 could have been a better game.I like this: “X-com (original) – I love turn-based squad strategy, but I also loved the completely open metagame of worldwide base management, and the theme. If I had to pick a favorite game of all time this is it.”Wait a few months Jay and I reveal the next successor of x-com series (not that Firaxis’s x-com is bad, bat is far from the original). We have some work on the site and its ready to go.…what?The project is higly secret at the moment, but will be revealed. Soon… 😀Are you trying to pretend you’re on the inside of some magical information about a game and are hinting at it on here? Get over yourself.  “I have magical powers! But I can’t show you ,but they will be revealed soon!”I have enough magical information, because it is my game. 🙂 Why is so hard for people to beleave that a simple forum user, can be a game dev?I have enough magical info, because it is my game. 🙂 Why it is so hard to beleave that a simple forum user it is a game dev?I find it really strange that the final art style was a hit internally. When I first saw it my heart sank with disappointment, so intensely that I still feel a bit upset about it. I played Diablo and Diablo II like a job for 10 years and really wanted a continuation. Diablo III still feels like it has nothing to do with the original series in theme and mechanics.Completely agree. Diablo 3 is only “hugely popular” to people who didn’t bother with Diablo 2Great Interview. I cannot help it but to like Jay as a person. I think he is a great person. I profoundly dislike how Diablo 3 turned out because it basically removed all the stuff I loved so much about Diablo 2 Lod. The game doesn’t feel like a “Diablo” game to me, or at least not nearly close enough to how a Diablo game feels.I really see the whole story of D3 and Jay etc. from a different perspective now. I think Jay Tried hard, but his vision did not align with the vision of Diablo 2 Lod people that LOVED the game from A to Z. I also believe that since D3 was a successor to Diablo 2 LOD, I think it was fair to expect the game to pick up where D2Lod left off, from itemization, map-randomness, character-development, mechanics-complexity, depth, replay-ability, story etc.I think Jay wanted to Re-Invent and revolutionize Diablo 3 too much and way too much of D2Lod was lost forever in the process. I think it was unnecessary to stray so far “from where the apple fell”. Improvements and new additions are absolutely great, but they should build upon what made the previous game (D2LOD) so awesome. Instead they decided to scrap everything from Diablo 2 LOD, absolutely everything.The only thing in Diablo 3 that reminds me of the previous games (to a very limited extend)are:-Skeleton King MiniBoss (Reference to D1 Boss) -Cain (yet he was killed by a butterfly in D3, a iconic character destroyed in the worst possible manner) -Barbarian class (yet is very different from D2Lod)That is it, nothing in the game reminds me of anything from D2Lod…I miss in particular:– Map-Randomization – Story that is very loosely allowing my fantasy to go wild. it should give me a setting, that’s it. In D2 the simple and light story was created to accompany the already created game. In D3 however, the story dictated how the game was being made (big mistake) – Town with a fire burning in the center – Town people NPC’s that go about their life while I don’t interact with them – Cain for Item Identification – Magic Find (This is A BIG ONE for me – I love to wear MF gear or boost my MF by any means and make sacrifices in order to have better MF chances) – Unidentified items, where I cannot tell what item it is until I actually ID it – D2 type affixes and itemization in general (this is a HUGE ONE for me) – Character-Development – Skill-Trees where I can allocate plenty points into skills of my choosing – Items with +Skills to allow my skills be boosted beyond Skill-point-Allocation Cut-Offs – Charms – Jewels (including Rainbow facets) – Runes – Runewords that use white/grey items as a base making almost every item worth checking out – Potential BIS Rare items that rolled godly – 50% character power comes from Character Level and Skill-Tree (making gear less “Must-Have”, and thus easing the impact of slow godly-item acquisition, which means the “Journey” itself is endgame and highly enjoyable) – 6-8 player games – D2 classes while adding new classes on-top – Open-World-Unregulated PVP with permanent Opt-Out option for those that dislike PVP – Ears from slain heroes 🙂 – Matt Uelmen Music and ambience (This is A BIG ONE for me) – Item Rarity and drop-rate of D2Lod with slightly better chances for High Runes than it was in D2Lod – Set-Items as an mid-journey alternative until you find runes and godly end-game uniques – 1-99 Leveling scheme – Quests that give skill-points, resistances and attributes etc. – Diablo walks the earth… – Hellfire Torch – Annihilus – And last but not least, Trading… but without an AH and especially WITHOUT a RMAH.On top of all that, I think the problem for me is that they made the game WAY too easy and too Noob-Friendly. Gear rains from the sky, everyone gets to be World of Warcraft level 70 instantly, there are no godly items and objects reserved for real dedicated gamers (Torch, Annihilus, Godly Runes and Runewords etc). D2Lod did it great, the godly endgame items and objects were not necessary to beat the game, but they were the perfect carrot on a stick aimed at dedicated players that play a lot. I had to do MF runs just ONE more time… because MAYBE some godly rune or item would drop… In D3 there is no such thing… Everything is thrown at you from the very beginning and finding things is boring and saddening because you know youre one step closer to stop playing the game because the loot hunt is happening WAY to fast and there is no “Long Journey”. I play every season and I am fully endgame geared within the first 24 hours and after 48 hours of play time I am done, because there is nothing worth doing anymore, the “Journey” is over by then.Ears from slain heroes  still got some +1000Take your head out of your ass and learn that D3 is not D2 LOD and your nagging will go away ! i’m sure that D3 was the same then D2 but with better graphics you would nagg and whine about that ! get a life and grow up !Quit assaulting people on a personal level because they disagree with you on a video game. What are you, 15? Grow up.I don’t know if you play Starcraft, but SC2 is the exact same game as SC1 with buffed graphics and improvements.Jay is not a bad person. He’s just an average person and an average game designer at best that can easily be manipulated by his co-workers. I think his IQ is not that great. To make matters worse he doesn’t have the instincts of a great artist or a great designer. But he can be a good team player. He just needs the right direction. Blood, Warhammer and Company of Heroes are good examples of that.But who am I to judge? I’m just a random person that has never met the guy. Perhaps I’m wrong but the end product and his public comments create this profile for him.I have nothing against him. I just don’t like what Blizzard has become. I hope Kotick will do something about their stupid culture.Yep, I was thinking about the average IQ when he was praising the other Blizzard employees and laughing.Spot on with the artistic instincts, Jay seems too focused on rules and order, being clinical.  He’s afraid to follow his heart/instincts. Therefore D3 feels soulless.I kind of always felt that way, just like you guys describe. But with all this said, I think its important to accept and embrace that this world is made interesting by creating many kind of people and many kind of minds.Although no one has said it directly, I don’t think it is wise to think that one form of life is “better” than another. I think there is a place for all of us in this world, and the extreme diversity and diverse levels of capability among our species is a beautiful thing, even if it makes it harder for some to deal with “lesser evils”. 😉With intellect, comes the ability to grasp or develop concepts and draw parallels more easily than others are able to. Also, at some point on our journey to wisdom, we should realize that in reality we know nothing in the grand scheme and that there is more out there to learn and experience than a billion life-times are able to assimilate. So I think we might be wiser interpreting diversity of individuals and perceptions about other’s intellect in a very careful fashion, as intelligence and capabilities come in many forms and shapes.“I spent countless hours dissecting Diablo 2 in particular, right down to playing through multiple times with a stopwatch so I could get an average of how quickly different kinds of items showed up, how often new monsters were encountered, frequency of environment changes, etc.”And yet D3 as released had incredibly rare legendary items that were complete shit when you found them.I remember with my first Wizard, that I found only 2 legendaries by the time I got to Act 1 inferno (where I promptly hit a brick wall).Contrast to D2 where I’m pretty sure I found Biggins Bonnet in a chest in the Cold Plains.The pillar idea sounds great on paper but clearly wasn’t executed. I think why there’s so much disdain for D3 is precisely that these ‘core values’ were completely missed. At least Jay came off human in this interview and not an arrogant prick as in the infamous ‘f that loser’ comment.He’s addressed it before at a game developer conference. He had like 7 pillars (or maybe 5?) for Diablo 3, things like “visceral action” and “powerful heroes”. I think he conclusion is that they nailed the action one, half-delivered on the powerful heroes, and then failed to really meet the others.Permaximum – “I just don’t like what Blizzard has become. I hope Kotick will do something about their stupid culture.” Lol, what?  I think you might be calling upon the wrong hero.Top_Commander – I agree with much of what you said, but wow that was a lot specific stuff.  Why not just say “I want an exact D2 remake with upgraded graphics, plus new classes and items” to save some time?  Just kidding I get it, but yes, in a bunch of key areas D3 failed to capture the fun of D2:LOD. -PVP in it’s weird casual glory, but also hardcore tournaments, or low level dueling. -Trading barter-style with it’s personal touch.  Trading up and up until you get that one thing you really needed. -Magic Find!!!  Can’t stop, won’t stop! Shako, chance guards, war travs.  All these godly items that exist only so that you can try to find other godly items.  Such a brutally awesome feedback loop. -An actual out of game social interface and letting me pick what game I’m joining.  Downsides? Yes, but I’ve always felt really disconnected in D3. -Power distribution, just like you said.  Character skill points filled a huge gap between having all the perfect items.  Any color item could have a use at any point in the game.K, I’m done.  Oh, and George probably already did his research and knew this interview was happening 2 years ago.  In fact, he probably did an interview with Jay Wilson but kept it to himself all this time. 😉Haha I know, a very specific list indeed 🙂I don’t want an exact copy of D2.If I would be in charge of making D3 and Blizzard would say “Listen we want to capture the magic of D1 and D2, but we also want to make a new iteration of D3, how would you do it?”Here it goes:-Potions spam removed and replaced with potions like D3, except no cooldowns, and instead potions deplete one third every time you use it. You have 3 full “drinks” before it is depleted. It takes 7-10 seconds to replenish one third of the bottle. This means in encounters where I really need to drink mana or Life potions I get to use up to 3 drinking-instances for a maximal recovery and then need to wait until the potion is refilled by one third, to have one further full recovery drinking-instance. It should also allow you to drink even when the potion has only recovered 5 or 10% of the potion, but the yield should be accordingly and only recover 10-20% of my life or mana when used at that moment.– Gold is either auto-pickup or the piles that drop are much less frequent, but larger instead, and then we still have to pick it up ourselves, but the frequency of having to pick up gold should be much less frequent than gold drops in D3.– Stamina removed. Characters run by default, but movement speed is not as ridiculous fast as it is in D3 (I am talking about endgame geared movement speed of parties, its just ridiculous)– Hostile PVP is removed and every player has to accept a duel in the open world. Players can also turn off PVP entirely in the options, so no one bothers them because no one can challenge you through the challenge system.– Trading is improved by adding an ingame-Trading platform, that only allows you to trade items for items. Further, Item-Rarity-Classifications exist, and the trading platform detects the rarity level of the item you want to offer for trade, and views items of other traders that match the rarity classification. Imagine it like placing a shako in the trading window, and the trading-house matches you with other players that offer an IST rune or Arachnid-Mesh-Spiderweb-Sash (while assuming all these items have the same rarity-classifications, which is determined by drop-chances). Further, open trading exists in-game that is unregulated, but more dangerous, so players can either use the safe trading-house or they can use open-trade in-game. To use the safe trading-house, you must go into the game-world and kill monsters to find loot, and the loot you find, determines what other items you can trade for in the trading-house. Items that are traded through the open trading in-game, become account bound after the first trade. When an item first drops, and you trade it in-game with some player, it becomes account bound to that player. However, if you use the trading-house, the item remains tradeable.– Rune drop chances, especially for HR’s would be slightly increased. Also the up-cubing for HRs would be improved by reducing the requirements for up-converting runes (only 2 runes of a certain kind are necessary from the start, to up-convert to the next highest rune)– I would copy everything else from D2:LoD in terms of itemization and affix design.– Classes would not have a “main-stat” like they do in D3. Further, all gear would be universally usable by all classes and almost all builds. Some Class-Specific items would exist for certain classes like the Sorceress etc. but the majority of items would be universally usable by all classes and most builds.– I would create D2 classes as well as D1 classes and create one or two new classes. The majority of players in D3 never played D1 or D2 so Blizzards argument “we wanted to do something new” does not work, because for the majority of new players, recreating D1 and D2 classes would be something NEW, since they didnt play D1 and D2 and there is a 12+ year long gap between D2Lod and D3. Further, this would also please D1 and D2 fans.– Talisman would be implemented to hold charms and free up our inventory.– Shared-Stash would be implemented (To be used by any of your characters)– World much bigger than D2 and maps are all randomly generated, so no map looks the same when you play it. The tile size is very small, so the generation of a map is done by a lot of “puzzle-pieces” and thus truly feels random. I would not use “huge tiles” for map-randomization as it doesnt appear random enough when playing.– 8 Player games– Rest everything like D2Lod, except more new Runewords and new unique charms, and unique items.– Cosmetics Shop implemented where people can purchase transmogs and Follower-Skins. Plenty other things that i wont list, but none of them should benefit in gameplay beyond visual aspects.– Developers continuously create “Small Tile puzzle pieces” according to act and zone, and add them through patches, so the Map-Generating mechanism has more and more potential tiles to pick from to generate random maps, the older the game gets.– Expansions bring at least one new class, new tile-sets, New globally-usable items, skills, Quests, and various mechanical features etc.Diablo 3 should have been made by higher quality designers who understood D2.  It was inordinately stupid and arrogant to not stick with the formula for why the series was popular.  These Wow developers made D3 into a version of Gauntlet.You are exactly right. The people who just absolutely ADORE D3 on this chat area are the same people who most likely never even fully completed a single run through of Diablo 2.  They literally could have just continued the storyline, put in the same D2 classes into D3 with new skills, builds, etc, made new uniques (not LEGENDARIES, and not ORANGE colored schemes)and updated the graphics engine and boom, D3 would have been 9.5/10 in the eyes of millions.Excellent interview. Can’t wait for the other parts 🙂Okay i just want to point out i am really really really fucking sick of all these diehard fucking veterans of diablo crying and crying and crying over the years about how D3 isnt D2. Im gonna say right now that if you are one of these jack offs you arent a true fucking diablo fan, simple. I loved all three of the games and i still play D3 to this day. Yes D3 was widely accepted as shit because it was a shock to everyones system. What do you expect from Blizzard to make an exact copy of the a game that was created with old tech over a decade ago? They had to start with a different approach and i just have to add that over the years they have really improved D3 so much and i feel that it isnt THE best Diablo game but it is up to scratch. Blizzard really are trying to make amends for all their shitty pissed off ungrateful spiteful fanbase.First of all its just game/fun not a matter of life or death, I have played since diablo 1 and still play D3 and in all these years peopel complain about everything, D2 was great but many even complained about this also, we want better graphics, more items, more skilss ect ect. In expansion LOD the same peopel again cry out loud we want this and we want that, the D3 arrived and still the same negative comments from everybody and then ROS still want changes, now suddenly the same dudes who say D2 was crap want the the crap back, allmost everybodt want AH closed (both houses) and now most want AH back and now we are waiting for Necro pack and god damm it even before its released dudes want Druid instead of Necro Sorry guys every game was good imo and there has been changes yes, its impossible to satisfied every Diablo player world wide. If you dont like the game then stop playing. This site has been a forum for Diablo haters if you dont like the game then again stop playing instead of call all there still like the game for idiots , jerks noobs ect. ect sorry for my English btwI agree on one point: That the Druid would have been better than the Necro.Copyright 2018 | Enthusiast Gaming.

      "The original \r\nDiablo went gold on the day after Christmas in 1996, after a \r\ngrueling four-month crunch period. We hadn't put any thought into what \r\ngame to do next, but as most developers can probably relate to, we were \r\npretty certain we weren't ready to return to the Diablo world \r\nafter such a long development cycle. The only thing we were certain \r\nof was that we wanted to avoid another crunch like we had just experienced. \r\nDiablo II went gold on June 15, 2000, after a grueling 12-month \r\ncrunch period.After \r\nDiablo shipped, we spent about three months recovering and kicking \r\naround game ideas for our next project, but nothing really stuck. The \r\nidea of returning to Diablo began to creep into the discussions, \r\nand after a couple of months of recuperation, we suddenly realized we \r\nweren't burned out on Diablo anymore. We dusted off the reams \r\nof wish-list items we had remaining from the original, compiled criticisms \r\nfrom reviews and customers, and began brainstorming how we could make \r\nDiablo II bigger and better in every way.Diablo \r\nII never had an official, complete design document. Of course, we \r\nhad a rough plan, but for the most part we just started off making up \r\nnew stuff: four towns instead of the original game's one; five character \r\nclasses, all different from the previous three; and many new dungeons, \r\nvast wilderness tile-sets, and greatly expanded lists of items, magic, \r\nand skills. We wanted to improve upon every aspect of the original. \r\nWhere Diablo had three different armor \"looks\" for \r\neach character, Diablo II would use a component system to generate \r\nhundreds of variations. Where Diablo had \"unique\" boss \r\nmonsters with special abilities, Diablo II would have a system \r\nfor randomly generating thousands of them. We would improve the graphics \r\nwith true transparency, colored light sources, and a quasi-3D perspective \r\nmode. Level loads would be a thing of the past. The story would be factored \r\nin from the beginning and actually have some bearing on the quests. \r\nWe knew creating this opus would be a big job. Because we had the gameplay \r\nbasics already polished, we figured we would hire some new employees, \r\ncreate some good tools, and essentially make four times the original \r\ngame doing only two times the work. We estimated a two-year development \r\nschedule.The Diablo \r\nII team comprised three main groups: programming, character art \r\n(everything that moves), and background art (everything that doesn't \r\nmove), with roughly a dozen members each. Design was a largely open \r\nprocess, with members of all teams contributing. Blizzard Irvine helped \r\nout with network code and Battle.net support. The Blizzard film department \r\n(also in Irvine) contributed the cinematic sequences that bracket each \r\nof Diablo's acts, and collaborated on the story line.Almost \r\nall of Diablo II's in-game and cinematic art was constructed \r\nand rendered in 3D Studio Max, while textures and 2D interface elements \r\nwere created primarily with Photoshop. The programmers wrote in C and \r\nsome C++, using Visual Studio and SourceSafe for version control.Blizzard \r\nNorth started out as Condor Games in September 1993. The first contracts \r\nwe landed were ports of Acclaim's Quarterback Club football games for \r\nhandheld systems and, more significantly, a Sega Genesis version of \r\nJustice League Task Force for Sunsoft. Silicon and Synapse, a developer \r\nthat would later change its name to Blizzard Entertainment, was developing \r\na Super Nintendo version of Justice League Task Force. Condor ended \r\nup pitching the idea for Diablo to Blizzard, and halfway through \r\nthe resulting development process Blizzard's parent company acquired \r\nCondor, renaming us Blizzard North. Throughout a tangled history of \r\ncorporate juggling and ownership changes, Blizzard North has remained \r\na very independent group. Our staff has grown steadily from about 12 \r\nat the start of Diablo to 24 at the start of Diablo II, \r\nand finally to our current group of more than 40. We concentrate 100 \r\npercent of our efforts on game development. To help keep this focus, \r\nBlizzard's headquarters in Irvine manages other functions, such as quality \r\nassurance, marketing, public relations, technical and customer support, \r\nas well as the operation of the Battle.net servers. Our parent company, \r\nHavas Interactive, deals with business functions such as sales, manufacturing, \r\nand accounting.While \r\n\t\t\tthe player characters are only seen in the game as 75 pixels \r\n\t\t\ttall, all were modeled and rendered in high resolution for use \r\n\t\t\ton the character selection screen and in promotional materials. \r\n\t\t\tHere, the Paladin stands tall.Creating \r\n\t\t\tdetailed sketches of settings, such as this hut in the Act III \r\n\t\t\tdock town of Kurast, preceded the actual modeling of background \r\n\t\t\tart.Much \r\n\t\t\ttime was spent perfecting Act I since it would likely be used \r\n\t\t\tin a beta test or demo.

We're working on a new, unannounced Diablo project.\"The remainder of the post doesn't offer much else, although it sounds as if this new project won't dramatically deviate from the typical look of a Diablo game. \"The ideal candidate works well in an environment of peers who are passionate about working on the dark gothic world of Diablo, making great games, killing millions of monsters and getting loot,\" it states.Blizzard has not announced any new Diablo games to date, although this isn't the first job opening to suggest one might be in the works. Whether this new project is a full-on sequel like Diablo 4 or something else remains to be seen. But with little in the way of major content updates for Diablo III released in the past few years outside of the Rise of the Necromancer DLC, fans have been holding out hope that something new was in the works.There's no indication of when we'll be hearing official details about the project.

      "Blizzard North, formerly known as Condor, was the Bay Area division of Blizzard Entertainment, known for the Diablo series. The studio was originally based in Redwood City, California, and then moved a short distance away to San Mateo, California, with Blizzard proper being based in Irvine (in southern California).The name \"Condor\" came from Project Condor, a game developed in secret by employees of a digital clip art company that went under.[1] Condor was established in 1993, founded by Max Schaefer, Erich Schaefer, and David Brevik.[2] While the idea for Diablo existed early on,[1] publishers refused Condor's pitches, as the game would be PC exclusive, and the genre was seen as being too niche.[3] In order to stay afloat, the company developed a number of sports games and the Sega Genesis version of Justice League Task Force. While showing off the Genesis version, they came into contact with Silicon & Synapse, who had developed the Super Nintendo version (the game's publisher had not informed Condor of the separate publishing scheme). Silcon & Synapse would later be named Blizzard Entertainment, and after the release of Warcraft,[1] which Condor offerred beta services for,[3] came back into contact with Condor to hear their pitch for Diablo. Blizzard liked the pitch, and offered to publish the game. The game received a $300,000 budget. To bolster its finances, Condor worked on sports games on the side.[1]Condor was purchased by Blizzard about six months before the release of Diablo in 1996.[1] The announcement came in December, 1995, that Blizzard was interested in acquiring Condor. They decided to join Blizzard proper as they had been impressed with the release of Warcraft II, and given its widespread release, were impressed with Blizzard's distribution of its game. The deal was finalized in February, 1996. Condor was renamed \"Blizzard North,\" but was allowed to keep its autonomy.[4] During the development period, Condor had been on the brink of insolvency several times, but the game's success guaranteed their stability.[2] 3D0 made a counter-bid that would have offered more, but Condor chose Blizzard as the company cultures were more similar.[1]Structurally, Blizzard North was considered an independent studio from Blizzard South, but also reported to them. There was never a real structure on how Blizzard North had to operate in regards to its parent company.[5]Diablo proved to be incredibly successful, and their 2000 sequel Diablo II was more successful yet. An expansion pack followed the year after.By June 2003 two new games were in production. However on June 30 2003, several key employees left Blizzard North to form the new companies Flagship Studios (8 moved here) and Castaway Entertainment (9 moved here). The Blizzard North exodus continued on with around 30 employees leaving the company in total.The resignations were partly due to a conflict with Blizzard Entertainment's owner, Vivendi, and partly due to employees wishing to start something new. Back at Blizzard North, however, they would have a common effect; of the two unannounced games that were in production at the time, one was now forced to be canceled. Blizzard Entertainment has since said the canceled game was a \"Blizzard North kind of game\".On August 1 2005, Blizzard Entertainment announced the closure of Blizzard North. A key reason for the closure was Blizzard North's poor development of what was to be Diablo III which did not meet the expectations of Vivendi. Former Blizzard North staffers including Joseph Lawrence, Wyatt Cheng and Matt Uelman subsequently appeared in the credits of Blizzard's next retail release, World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. The work of former Blizzard North artist Phroilan Gardner was also featured in editions of World of Warcraft: The Trading Card Game around the same time.A few employees from the Diablo team, including Eric Sexton, Michio Okamura and Steven Woo, organized to launch a new company, Hyboreal Games.[6][7] Only a few joined Team 3 in development of Blizzard South's version of Diablo III.[8]Blizzard North had 12 members by the time it began work on Diablo I. This had reached 14/15 by the time of the game's release.[2] This increased to 24 at the start of development of Diablo II, and had grown to 40 by 2000.[10] Notable members included:",

However on June 30 2003, several key employees left Blizzard North to form the new companies Flagship Studios (8 moved here) and Castaway Entertainment (9 moved here). The Blizzard North exodus continued on with around 30 employees leaving the company in total.The resignations were partly due to a conflict with Blizzard Entertainment's owner, Vivendi, and partly due to employees wishing to start something new. Back at Blizzard North, however, they would have a common effect; of the two unannounced games that were in production at the time, one was now forced to be canceled. Blizzard Entertainment has since said the canceled game was a \"Blizzard North kind of game\".On August 1, 2005, Blizzard Entertainment announced the closure of Blizzard North. A key reason for the closure was Blizzard North's poor development of what was to be Diablo III which did not meet the expectations of Vivendi. Former Blizzard North staffers including Joseph Lawrence, Wyatt Cheng and Matt Uelmen subsequently appeared in the credits of Blizzard's next retail release, World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade.  The work of former Blizzard North artist Phroilan Gardner was also featured in editions of World of Warcraft: The Trading Card Game around the same time.A few employees from the Diablo team, including Eric Sexton, Michio Okamura and Steven Woo, organized to launch a new company, Hyboreal Games.Blizzard Entertainment (Activision Blizzard •  BlizzCon (Blizzard North •  Worldwide Invitational) •  Battle.net (Battle.net 2.0 •  Battle.net Balance •  Battle.net Support) •  Blizzard Insider •  BlizzCast •  Battle.net Shop •  Blizzard Gear •  Arcade Workshop)Battle.net Desktop app [β] •  Blizzard Downloader •  Blizzard Launcher •  Blizzard Repair •  Blizzard UpdaterWarcraft (MMO •  RTS •  Hearthstone [β]) •  Diablo •  Starcraft •  Heroes of the StormBattle.net Authenticator •  Battle.net Mobile Authenticator •  BattleTag •  Real ID •  Blizzard Fansites Program",
      "Blizzard is working busily away behind the scenes on Diablo, confirming that there are multiple projects in the series currently under development. This will come as good news for fans of the franchise, as it's now been six years since the last entry in the series, Diablo 3, saw release.Some players had been expecting Blizzard to make some kind of announcement about the future of Diablo some time soon. The franchise's status as one of the most popular action-based RPGs with some of the best boss battles around always meant that it was unlikely that Diablo was going to be retired, while a job listing for a dungeon artist to work on an \"unannounced Diablo project\" earlier this year confirmed that the developer was creating something for the series.Related: Blizzard Has An Unannounced Diablo Project In The WorksHowever, it turns out that it's not just one project, but several. The bombshell was dropped by Community Manager Brandy Camel over on Twitter in a video giving a brief update on Diablo 3. Although the video started by discussing the game's Season 14, that's not what has caught the attention of players. Instead, it was the reveal that Blizzard has \"multiple Diablo projects in the works.\" The brief video can be seen below.Unfortunately, that's where the details about the games in question ended. Instead, Camel explained that \"some of them are going to take longer than others,\" so it may be a while before all of Blizzard's plans come to light. However, the Community Manager did state that the developer \"may have some things to show you later this year.\" With Blizzcon set for the start of November, perhaps gamers will have more of an idea about Blizzard's Diablo plans then.Exactly what these games could be will no doubt become a subject of much discussion among fans. The top of most players lists will be Diablo 4, although equally a remaster of Diablo 1 or 2 would also go down well - particularly after Blizzard tested the waters with that Diablo 1-esque mode for Diablo 3. Who knows: maybe that cryptic hint at Diablo on Nintendo Switch may turn out to be true as well.Although some may want more details, Blizzard is perhaps playing it right by keeping things quiet for now. The company is well-known for the high standards it holds games to during the development process, and high-profile cancelled games like Overwatch predecessor Project Titan and the great-looking StarCraft: Ghost still leave some players feeling pangs of regret. Nonetheless, it will be interesting to see if Blizzard has anything to reveal in November.Source: BlizzardTags:\ndiabloThePremium grants you  UNLIMITED AD FREE ACCESS  accross our full Network!Have an account?

Max Schaefer shares his brother’s sentiments, but emphasizes that the extraordinary Diablo franchise was created by everyday people. “What I hope readers take away from the book is that regular people make games like ours, so don’t ever think you can’t be a part of something like that.”“Stay Awhile and Listen” is scheduled for a summer 2012 release on Amazon, Kindle, Apple iBooks, and nook in summer 2012. In the meantime, stay awhile and read our Q&A with the author for more details on what’s in store.GR: Will readers get the real story about Blizzard North’s closure?Craddock: The book's concluding chapters are devoted entirely to the development of Diablo III and the trials and tribulations faced by Blizzard North during their final two years. But don't think of skipping right to those chapters! The how, what, and why of Blizzard North's closure traces back to its earliest years, so you'll need to, ahem, Stay Awhile and Listen to understand the big picture of the studio's final years.GR: Will readers find out any details about how much (if any) of Blizzard North’s work on Diablo III made it into the version fans are seeing right now?Craddock: Learning about Blizzard North's plans for Diablo III and reading through Blizzard Entertainment's plans for the game since its official debut in 2008 has been one of the highlights in writing this book, and, I knew, would be of great interest to readers. Shortly after Blizzard released the D3 beta, I conducted follow-up interviews with several of my Blizzard North contacts to discuss this very topic.Not surprisingly, they were as eager to talk about it as I was, sharing their thoughts on how the game was shaping up and pointing to gameplay and lore elements in the beta that they recognized as major or minor permutations of the content they created through 2005. For example, the character of Leah, presently Deckard Cain's adopted daughter, existed in North's version of the game, but under a different name and conceived by a very interesting set of parents...GR: Will the book cover the move by David Brevik and Max and Erich Schaefer to co-found Flagship Studios and the creation of Hellgate/Mythos?Craddock: Although the book does not cover Flagship and its games directly, it does touch on the effects Flagship's formation had on Blizzard North. Dave, Max, and Erich cultivated a very powerful organic and egalitarian culture at Blizzard North that contributed to two of the greatest, most important games ever made. When the three founders left, the studio became a very different place. How could it not? To some developers, Blizzard North without the three founders was no longer Blizzard North.Over the book's final chapters, readers will witness many individuals battle through several different struggles. One such struggle: to stay at Blizzard North and take a hand in creating Diablo III--a bonafide dream job if ever one existed--or follow their former leaders and the culture they intended to rekindle at their new company.Having said all that, the story of Flagship, Hellgate, and beyond would make for a helluva sequel, wouldn't it?Get the best gaming deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable gaming news and more!GamesRadar+ is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

      "Diablo III isn't the end of Blizzard's interest in its hellish action RPG franchise. Community Manager Brandy Camel has revealed in a video that the developer has \"multiple Diablo projects\" in progress, and it might have \"some things\" to show later in 2018. That won't just mean themed seasons like the ongoing Season of Greed, either. Further seasons are in the cards, but they're not the sum total of what Blizzard is working on.This doesn't necessarily guarantee a Diablo IV, although Blizzard was looking for a series director back in 2016. It could involve revisiting earlier games (Ars Technica suggests a StarCraft-style remaster), versions for mobile platforms or just more substantial Diablo III updates.

      "Diablo II is an action role-playing hack and slash video game developed by Blizzard North and published by Blizzard Entertainment in 2000 for Microsoft Windows, Classic Mac OS, and Mac OS X. The game, with its dark fantasy and horror themes, was conceptualized and designed by David Brevik and Erich Schaefer, who with Max Schaefer acted as project leads on the game. The producers were Matthew Householder and Bill Roper.\nBuilding on the success of its predecessor Diablo (1996), Diablo II was one of the most popular games of 2000. Major factors that contributed to Diablo II's success include its continuation of popular fantasy themes from the previous game and its access to Blizzard's free online play service Battle.net. An expansion to Diablo II, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, was released in 2001. A sequel, Diablo III, was announced in 2008, and was released on May 15, 2012.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDiablo II's storyline progresses through four chapters or \"Acts\". Each act follows a predetermined path, but the wilderness areas and dungeons between key cities are randomly generated. The player progresses through the story by completing a series of quests within each act, while there are also optional side dungeons for extra monsters and experience. In contrast to the first Diablo, whose levels consisted of descending deeper and deeper into a Gothic-themed dungeon and Hell, Diablo II's environments are much more varied. Act I is similar to the original Diablo; the Rogue Encampment is a simple palisade fort, while plains and forests making up the wilderness area, and the Monastery resembles the typical Middle Ages fortress. Act II mimics Ancient Egypt's desert and tombs; Lut Gholein resembles a Middle Eastern city and palace during the Crusades. Act III is supposedly based on the Central American jungles; Kurast is inspired by the lost Maya civilization. Act IV takes place in Hell and is the shortest, with just three quests compared to the other Acts that have six.\nThe Lord of Destruction expansion adds the fifth chapter Act V which continues the story where Act IV left off. Act V's style is mainly mountainous as the player ascends Mount Arreat, with alpine plateaus and icy tunnels and caverns. Occasional portals can take the player to dungeons in Hell (seen in Act IV) for extra monsters and experience. After reaching the summit of Arreat, the player gains access to the Worldstone Keep (whose architecture may be reminiscent of Angkor Wat and other Hindu temples).In addition to the acts, there are three sequential difficulty levels: Normal, Nightmare, and Hell; completing the game (four Acts in the original or five Acts in the expansion) on a difficulty setting will open up the next level. On higher difficulties, monsters are more varied, stronger and may be resistant or immune to an element or physical damage; experience is penalized on dying, and the player's resistances are handicapped. However, better items are rewarded to players as they go through higher difficulties. A character retains all abilities and items between difficulties, and may return to a lower difficulty at any time, albeit it is not possible to re-play the quests that are already completed.\nPlayers can create a hardcore character. In normal mode, the player can resurrect their character if killed and resume playing, while a hardcore character has only one life. If killed, the character is permanently dead and unplayable. In addition, all items and equipment on that character will be lost unless another friendly character has the \"loot\" icon checked. Standard and hardcore characters play on separate online channels; as such a hardcore player can never appear in the same game session as a standard player.\n\n\n=== Item system ===\nDiablo II uses a system of randomly generated equipment similar to the original Diablo, but more complicated. Weapons and armor are divided into several quality levels: normal, magical, set, rare and unique. Normal quality items are base items with a fixed set of basic properties, such as attribute requirements, maximum durability, armor rating (on armor), block chance (on shields), damage and attack speed (on weapons). Magical quality items have blue names and one or two randomly selected bonuses, such as bonuses attributes, skills or damage, indicated by a prefix or suffix. Rare quality items have randomly generated yellow names and 2 to 6 random properties. Unique items have fixed names in gold text, and instead of randomized properties, they have a set of 3 to 8 preselected properties. Green-named set items have fixed names and preselected properties like unique items, and belong to specific named sets of 2 to 6 items. Additional properties known as set bonuses are activated by equipping multiple or all items from the same set. These are themed on individuals, like Civerb's cudgel, shield and amulet each provide individual bonuses which are enhanced if two or more of the items are used to equip a character. It is unusual to encounter more than one item from a set in a single playthrough of the game, so collectors need to play the game many times to accumulate all items from a set, or purchase them online from other players who possess them but do not need them. Additionally, items can possess sockets, which can be used to upgrade items by adding gems for various bonuses.Diablo II includes an item crafting system. An item known as the Horadric Cube is used to combine two or more items to create a new item. For example, 3 identical lower quality gems can be combined to create a single higher quality gem, and 3 small rejuvenation potions can be combined to create a single, more powerful rejuvenation potion.\n\n\n=== Character classes ===\n\nDiablo II allows the player to choose between five different character classes: Amazon, Necromancer, Barbarian, Sorceress, and Paladin. Each character has different strengths, weaknesses and sets of skills to choose from, as well as varying beginning attributes. The maximum level that any character can obtain is level 99.\n\nThe Amazon hails from the islands of the Twin Seas, near the border of the Great Ocean, and her clan is a rival to the Sisters of the Sightless Eye (known as Rogues). The Amazon is akin to the Rogue of Diablo: both primarily use bows, and both make equal use of strength and magic, however the Amazon can also use javelins and spears. Many of her defensive skills are passive in nature, especially Dodge, Avoid, and Evade. The Amazon is voiced by Jessica Straus.\nThe Necromancer is a versatile death-themed spell caster. Necromancers are the priests of the Cult of Rathma from the Eastern jungles. His Summoning skills allow him to raise skeletons, create golems, and resurrect dead monsters to fight alongside him. The Necromancer possesses powerful poison spells, which rapidly drain life from afflicted monsters. He also has \"Bone\" skills, which directly damage enemies, while bypassing most resistances. His Curses also afflict the enemy with debilitating status ailments, sowing confusion and chaos in their ranks. The Necromancer is voiced by Michael McConnohie.\nThe Barbarian is a powerful melee fighter from the steppes of Mount Arreat. He is an expert at frontline combat, able to absorb great punishment, and is the only class capable of dual wielding weapons. His Combat Masteries allow him to specialize in different types of weapons, and also passively increase his resistance, speed, and defense. His Warcries dramatically increase the combat effectiveness of him and his party, as well as afflicting status ailments on enemies. He has a variety of Combat Skills at his command, most of which focus on delivering great force upon a single foe, while some also give him considerable athleticism allowing him to leap over chasms and rivers. The Barbarian is voiced by David Thomas.\nThe Sorceress hails from a rebellious coven of female witches who have wrested the secrets of magic use from the male-dominated mage clans of the East. She can cast ice, lightning and fire spells. Nearly all of these skills are offensive in nature, besieging the enemy with elemental calamity. Her Cold Skills can freeze enemies solid and bypass resistances, but do less damage than lightning or fire. The Sorceress's Teleport spell allows her to instantly travel to a new destination, making her very difficult to hit. The strong point of the Sorceress is her damaging spells and casting speed; her weakness is her relatively low hit points and defense. The Sorceress is voiced by Liana Young.\nThe Paladin is a crusader from the Church of Zakarum, fighting for the glory of the Light. He is part of the forces that defeated King Leoric's army in the first Diablo, although his Order is eventually corrupted by Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred. To reflect his holy nature, the zealous Paladin's combat skills range from fanatical attacks to heavenly thunderbolts. His skills are split into Combat Skills, Defensive Auras, and Offensive Auras. His auras have a range of abilities, such as increasing damage, resisting magic attacks, or boosting defense. Most auras either affect all party members and allies, or all enemies within the area of effect. The Paladin is highly proficient in the use of a shield, and is the only character that can use it as a weapon. The Paladin also has specialized skills for eliminating the undead. The Paladin is voiced by Larry B. Scott.Two additional character classes, the Druid and Assassin, were added in the expansion.\nThe player can enlist the help of one hireling (computer-controlled mercenaries) from a mercenary captain in the town; the Rogue Scouts, Desert Mercenaries and Ironwolves, and Barbarians, from Acts I, II, III, and V (expansion only). The expansion allows players to retain their mercenary throughout the entire game as well as equipping them with armor and weapons. Hirelings gain experience and attributes like the player, although their level cannot surpass that of their master character. Typically players choose a hireling that provides something missing from their character class; for instance the melee-focused Barbarian may choose an Ironwolf for ranged magical support.\n\n\n=== Multiplayer ===\nDiablo II can be played multiplayer on a local area network (LAN) or the Blizzard's Battle.net online service. Unlike the original Diablo, Diablo II was made specifically with online gaming in mind. Several spells (such as auras or war cries) multiply their effectiveness if they are cast within a party, and although dungeons still exist, they were largely replaced by open spaces.\nBattle.net is divided into \"Open\" and \"Closed\" realms. Players may play their single-player characters on open realms; characters in closed realms are stored on Blizzard's servers, as a measure against cheating, where they must be played every 90 days to avoid expiration. Originally, these closed realms served their purpose of preventing cheating, as open games were subject to many abuses as the characters were stored on players' own hard drives. Within the last few years, however, many cheats are used on these closed realms. Hacks, bots, and programs which allow the player to run multiple instances of the game at the same time are not allowed by Blizzard but are very commonly used. Spambots (programs which advertise sites selling Diablo II's virtual items for real-world currency) run rampant on the service and a player hosting a public game can expect a visit from one every few minutes. Due to the surplus of virtual items provided by the automated bots, which repeatedly kill bosses to obtain items, supply is well in excess of demand, and items which used to trade well are now often given away for nothing.As the game can be played cooperatively (Players vs. Environment, PvE), groups of players with specific sets of complementary skills can finish some of the game's climactic battles in a matter of seconds, providing strong incentives for party-oriented character builds. Up to eight players can be in one game; they can either unite as a single party, play as individuals, or form multiple opposing parties. Experience gained, monsters' hit points and damage, and the number of items dropped are all increased as more players join a game, though not in a strictly proportional manner. Players are allowed to duel each other with all damage being reduced in player vs player (PvP). The bounty for a successful kill in PvP is a portion of the gold and the \"ear\" of the defeated player (with the previous owner's name and level at the time of the kill).\nThe Ladder System can be reset at various intervals to allow for all players to start fresh with new characters on an equal footing. Ladder seasons have lasted from as short as six months to over a year. When a ladder season ends, all ladder characters are transferred to the non-ladder population. Certain rare items are available only within ladder games, although they can be traded for and exchanged on non-ladder after the season has ended.The game has been patched extensively; the precise number of patches is impossible to determine as Battle.net has the capability of making minor server-side patches to address immediate issues. As of  July 2016, the game is in version 1.14d. Through the patch history, several exploits and issues have been addressed (such as illegal item duplication, though it still exists), as well as major revamps to the game's balance (such as the ability to redo skills and attributes). Not all patches have affected Diablo II directly, as several were designed to address issues in the expansion to the game and had minimal effects on Diablo II.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nDiablo II takes place after the end of the previous game, Diablo, in the world of Sanctuary. In Diablo, an unnamed warrior defeated Diablo and attempted to contain the Lord of Terror's essence within his own body.  Since then, the hero has become corrupted by the demon's spirit, causing demons to enter the world around him and wreak havoc.\nA band of adventurers who pass through the Rogue Encampment hear these stories of destruction and attempt to find out the cause of the evil, starting with this corrupted \"Dark Wanderer.\" As the story develops, the truth behind this corruption is revealed: the soulstones were originally intended to imprison the Prime Evils after they were banished to the mortal realm by the Lesser Evils.  With the corruption of Diablo's soulstone, the demon is able to control the Dark Wanderer and is attempting to free his two brothers Mephisto, and Baal.  Baal, united with the mage Tal-Rasha, is imprisoned in a tomb near Lut Gholein.  Mephisto is imprisoned in the eastern temple city of Kurast.\nAs the story progresses, cut scenes show the Dark Wanderer's journey as a drifter named Marius follows him.  The player realizes that the Dark Wanderer's mission is to reunite with the other prime evils, Baal and Mephisto. The story is divided up into four acts:\n\nAct I - The adventurers rescue Cain, who is imprisoned in Tristram, and then begin following the Dark Wanderer. The Dark Wanderer has one of the lesser evils, Andariel, corrupt the Sisters of the Sightless Eye (Rogues) and take over their Monastery. The adventurers overcome Andariel and then follow the Wanderer east.\nAct II - While the adventurers search the eastern desert for Tal-Rasha's tomb, the Dark Wanderer gets there first. Marius is tricked into removing Baal's soulstone from Tal-Rasha and the Archangel Tyrael charges Marius with taking the soulstone to Hell to destroy it. The Dark Wanderer and Baal join with Mephisto, open a portal to Hell, and the Dark Wanderer sheds his human form and becomes the demon Diablo.\nAct III - The adventurers find the seat of the Zakarum religion at the Temple of Kurast, where the portal to Hell is located. They defeat Mephisto, who was left guarding the entrance, and take his soulstone.\nAct IV - The adventurers slay Diablo in Hell and destroy the soulstones of Mephisto and Diablo on the Hellforge, preventing their return.In the epilogue, Marius, speaking in a prison cell, indicates he was too weak to enter Hell, and that he fears the stone's effects on him. He gives the soulstone to his visitor.  The visitor reveals himself to be Baal, the last surviving Prime Evil now in possession of his own soulstone. He then kills Marius and sets the prison cell on fire.\nThe story continues in the expansion Diablo II: Lord of Destruction where Baal attempts to corrupt the mythical Worldstone on Mount Arreat. Upon returning to the Pandemonium Fortress after defeating Diablo, Tyrael opens a portal to send the adventurers to Arreat.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe game was originally to be released in 1999, after being shown off at E3 1998. According to designer and project lead Erich Schaefer, \"Diablo II never had an official, complete design document... for the most part we just started making up new stuff.\"  The game was slated to have two years of development work, but it had taken Blizzard North over three years to finish.  Diablo II, despite having less than one percent of the original code from Diablo I and having much of its content and internal coding done from scratch, was seen by the testers as \"more of the same.\"  The game was meant to be released simultaneously both in North America and internationally.  This allowed the marketing and PR department for Blizzard North to focus their efforts in building up excitement in players worldwide for the first week of sales, contributing to the game's success.\n\n\n=== Music development ===\n\nThe score was composed by Matt Uelmen and integrates creepy ambience with melodic pieces. The style of the score is ambient industrial and experimental. It was recorded in Redwood City, Oakland, and San Mateo, California, from April 1997 to March 2000.\nSome tracks were created by reusing the tracks from the original game, while others by rearranging tracks that were out-takes. Other scores are combinations of parts that were created more than a year after the first game's release. A single track usually integrates recorded samples from sound libraries, live recorded instrument interpretation samples specially meant for the game (guitar, flute, oriental percussion), and electronic instruments also, making the tracks difficult for later live interpretations.\nWhile the player visits the town, the game recreates the peaceful atmosphere from the first Diablo game, so for that the theme from Act I called \"Rogue\" comes back with the same chords of the original piece, reproducing only a part of the original Diablo town theme. For Act II Mustafa Waiz, a percussionist, and Scott Petersen, the game's sound designer, worked on the drum samples. Waiz played on the dumbek, djembe, and finger cymbals which gave Matt Uelmen a base upon which to build tracks around.\nThe town theme from Act II, \"Toru\", makes strong statement of departure from the world of Act I while also maintaining a thematic connection to what had come before. It is the first time in the series to be used some radically different elements than the guitars and choral sounds that dominate both the original Diablo and the opening quarter of Diablo II. The foundation of the \"Toru\" piece is found in exciting dynamics of a Chinese wind gong. The instrument radically changes color from a steady mysterious drone to a harsh, fearsome noise, that gives exotic feeling and at the same time the pacing of the second town. In all sequences of Act II with deserts and valleys, Arabic percussion sounds dominate.\nThe composer was impressed by two of the Spectrasonics music libraries, Symphony of Voices and Heart of Asia. He used samples from Heart of Asia in the Harem piece from Act II. The \"Crypt\" track uses a sample from Symphony of Voices; the choral phrase Miserere. Voice samples from Heart of Asia, Heart of Africa, and Symphony of Voices by Spectrasonics.\nThe \"Harem\" track samples from Heart of Asia the Sanskrit Female 1 samples.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nThe game was released in Collector's Edition format, containing bonus collector's material, a copy of the Diablo Dungeons & Dragons pen-and-paper campaign setting, and promotional movies for other Blizzard games. In 2000, the Diablo II: Exclusive Gift Set similarly contained exclusive collector's material and promotional videos, as well as a copy of the official strategy guide. The 2000 released Diablo Gift Pack contained copies of Diablo and Diablo II, but no expansions. The 2001 Diablo: Battle Chest version contained copies of Diablo II, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, the official strategy guide, and the original Diablo. Recently however, the Battle Chest edition no longer contains the original Diablo.\n\n\n=== Support and legacy ===\nBlizzard continues to provide limited support for Diablo II, including occasional patches. Although the original CD retail release worked on Windows 95/98/Me/NT4SP5, the current version downloadable from Battle.net requires at least Windows 2000/XP.Around 2008, the announcement of Diablo III renewed the interest in its predecessor and brought more attention to the many mods available for the game.In 2015 an unofficial port for the ARM architecture based Pandora handheld became available by static recompilation and reverse engineering of the original x86 version.On March 11, 2016 Blizzard released the 1.14a Patch, which added support for Windows 7 and newer, an OS X installer and support for OS X 10.10 and 10.11, although there is currently no support for OS X 10.13.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Sales ===\nIn its debut day on shelves, Diablo II sold 184,000 units. Its sales reached 2 million copies within one and a half months on shelves. In North America, it sold 790,285 units and earned $41.05 million by the end of October 2000, according to PC Data. Another $4.47 million were earned in the region by that date via sales of the Collector's Edition. In April 2001, the game received a \"Double-Platinum\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungsoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 400,000 units in Germany.It was awarded a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records 2000 edition for being the fastest selling computer game ever sold, with more than 1 million units sold in the first two weeks of availability. Its sales during 2000 alone reached 2.75 million globally; 33% of these copies were sold outside the United States, with South Korea making up the largest international market. Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade,  World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King, World of Warcraft: Cataclysm and Diablo III have since surpassed Diablo II's record to become fastest-selling computer games ever at their times of release, according to Blizzard. As of June 29, 2001, Diablo II has sold 4 million copies worldwide.In the United States, Diablo II sold 1.7 million copies and earned $67.1 million by August 2006, after its release in June 2000. It was the country's second best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all Diablo games released between January 2000 and August 2006, including Diablo II, had reached 4.5 million units in the United States by the latter date. It received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Copies of Diablo: Battle Chest continue to be sold in retail stores, appearing on the NPD Group's top 10 PC games sales list as recently as 2010. Even more remarkably, the Diablo: Battle Chest was the 19th best selling PC game of 2008 – a full seven years after the game's initial release – and 11 million users still played Diablo II and StarCraft over Battle.net in 2010.\n\n\n=== Critical reviews ===\nDiablo II had a positive reception. The PC versions of the game achieved an overall score of 88 on Metacritic and 89% at GameRankings. The Mac version achieved 83% on Game Rankings. Gamespy awarded the game an 86 out of 100, IGN awarded the game an 8.3 out of 10, and GameSpot awarded the game an 8.5 out of 10.\n\n\n=== Awards ===\nDiablo II earned GameSpot's 2000 runner-up Reader's Choice Award for role-playing game of the year. The game has received the \"Computer Game of the Year\", \"Computer Role Playing Game of the Year\", and \"Game of the Year\" awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences at the 2001 Interactive Achievement Awards. In August 2016, Diablo II placed 21st on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time list. It was placed at No. 8 on Game Informer's \"Top 100 RPGs Of All Time\" list.\n\n\n== Secret Cow Level ==\nThe \"Secret Cow Level\" is the result of a running joke from the original Diablo that spawned from an Internet rumor about the cows that appear in the game, seemingly without purpose. Supposedly, if the cow was clicked a certain number of times, a portal to a secret level would open. The rumor turned out to be a hoax, but the legend was born, and player after player asked Blizzard about how to access the level.\n\nIn Diablo: Hellfire, an add-on for Diablo created by third-party developer Synergistic Software, it was possible to change a parameter in a specific text file, so that the farmer was dressed in a cow suit, with appropriate new dialogue (\"Moo.\" \"I said Moo!\"). To stop the rumors, Blizzard included a cheat in StarCraft that read \"There is no cow level\", adding to the official denial of the cow level. On April 1, 1999, a Diablo II Screenshot of the Week featured cows fighting. People wondered if the screenshot was an April Fool's joke or if there really was a Secret Cow Level planned for Diablo II, which turned out to be true. The \"Secret Cow Level\" is considered one of gaming's top ten Easter eggs according to IGN. \n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of PC titles\nList of PC exclusive titles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
      "We’ve got many Blizzard games covered here – WarCraft II, StarCraft, Diablo, Diablo II – all of them five-star titles. Blizzard’s track record in producing top selling and critically acclaimed games is nothing short of impressive, so let’s take a closer look at this company, its history and learn just what makes it tick.Blizzard was founded in February of 1991 as Silicon & Synapse, Inc., and up until February of 1994 developed numerous games for other publishers, including Amiga Lord of the Rings, Amiga Battlechess II, and The Lost Vikings, Blackthorne and The Life and Death of Superman. Silicone & Synapse changed its name first to Chaos Studios and then to Blizzard Entertainment in April of 1994, the same year it was acquired by Davidson & Associates, Inc. In November of that year, Blizzard released the first game under its new label, WarCraft: Orcs and Humans.“Dune II was the one that started it all,” explained Blizzard’s Bill Roper in an interview some years back. “We couldn’t believe that no one else, including Westwood, had ever done another game that had this real-time strategy element. [WarCraft] got strong reviews and was really well accepted by journalists and the hardcore gaming community. For a first title it sold really well, and Davidson was ecstatic with it. We did more than our projected numbers and it established what I think has always been a precedent for Blizzard. We really work to make excellent, definitive titles.”In December of 1995, Blizzard released its biggest game yet WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness. This would be the first in a string of games that would garner game of the year honors from various sources and top the sales charts. WarCraft II expanded on the gameplay of the first game, offering a new resource to mine in oil, and it was the first game with playable naval units.The initial concept for WarCraft II was something that would never reach the store shelves. “We had this whole new idea about the opening cinematics. You would see a couple of fighter pilots flying their F-16s, and one guy would radio about bogeys coming in, and then the other would say, ‘I know where it is! I’ve got it on my scope!’ Then a dragon would come in and flame this F-16. It was going to be WarCraft II with the orcs and trolls and ogres and dragons all coming in through a dark portal into modern day earth. We would have had guys with machine guns and hand grenades. We talked about it for another couple of hours and then said, ‘Nah, that’s a really bad idea.’ I’m really glad we got that one out of the way and stuck with full fantasy.”WarCraft II and Westwood Studios’ Command & Conquer were released within months of one another, and these two games helped expand the multiplayer gaming scene, with no small thanks to Kali, a $20 software utility and matching service that allowed players to spoof a LAN connection and play these games over the Internet (much like GameRanger is still used today to play these games online). Blizzard supported Kali and WarCraft II played with a special executable they released: war2kali.exe.The nearly simultaneous release of these two powerhouse games also sparked a bit of a rivalry between Westwood and Blizzard. “It was a very friendly and very respectful rivalry,” explains Roper. “It was back and forth between us and we both were the better for it. It helped to escalate and skyrocket the genre. I have nothing but the utmost respect for Westwood. They made some great games and they still make great games.”In May of 1996 Blizzard released the expansion WarCraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal. In July of 1996, CUC Software Services (which also owned Sierra) acquired Davidson and Blizzard. By September of that year, WarCraft II reached 1.2 million copies sold and was the number-one selling title of the year.From January of ’97 to the present, Blizzard was busy, releasing Diablo, StarCraft, Brood War and Diablo II, all of which enjoyed critical and commercial success. CUC became the Cendant Corporation, and Cendant was evenutally purchased by Havas, a French company. In 1999 Blizzard released its most recent WarCraft product, the WarCraft II Battlenet Edition, which included a few minor tweaks, but was mainly done to provide a native Windows version of the game with built-in Battle.net support.There is one more WarCraft game that Blizzard worked on that was never finished, WarCraft Adventures: Lord Of The Clan. “One thing we’ve always tried to do as a company is make the kinds of game that excite us and that we want to play, and that was the impetus behind making it,” explains Roper. “As we went along we found out that there’s a lot of different things that we had never done before that we needed to do for this game. We didn’t like the way some of the puzzles worked, so we ended up bringing in Steve Meretzky to make a pass over the whole project.”Roper said that Blizzard began to feel that the opportunity to release an old style adventure game had slipped away. “Curse of Monkey Island came out and Grim Fandango was next in line for Lucas, and we really started to feel like the game wouldn’t live up to the expectations of fans. We just decided that it wouldn’t be what our fans want or what we want, so we made the very hard decision to cancel the project.” Roper did mention that some parts of WarCraft Adventures made it into WarCraft III, including Thrall, the orcish Warchief and leader of the Horde. “Some of the characters and storylines we created will be used in WarCraft III. The animation we did is probably going to stay locked up in the Blizzard vaults forever.”When approaching Blizzard Entertainment’s Irvine headquarters at around 2003, the first thing you would notice is how bland and corporate its facilities were – sprawling across several floors in a nondescript building, with room after room of cubes and offices. Looking back at this sterile and dull environment, it’s difficult to figure out where Blizzard keeps the magic that has led to the creation of games like Diablo and StarCraft. Where were the diodes with bolts of electrical energy arcing between them? Why wasn’t the ceiling cranked open to draw upon the mystical creative energies of the universe? Why are there printers and paperclips and not tomes of ancient wisdom scattered on these desks? Just where is the magic?Inside those walls, Blizzard conjured their venerable third installment of the WarCraft series of real-time strategy games, taking the game into 3D and tweaking the standard “collect resources, build a town and defenses, amass an army, attack your opponent” style of gameplay. WarCraft III represented a number of firsts for Blizzard. Perhaps most significantly, it’s the first game that melds role-playing to real-time strategy. As reported in its conceptual phases, Blizzard has once called WarCraft III an “RPS”, which is its term for a role-playing strategy game – after seeing the game in action, it’s easy to see why. “We want players to focus on managing battles and casting spells and counterspells, […] We don’t want players to have to be in the base all the time and micromanage.”Few early strategy games have made the move to 3D with any measure of success; usually, it just adds to the complexity of the control scheme. The more you make the player responsible for finding the proper angles to view the game, the tougher it is to play. Not only did Warcraft III get the 3D portion right (despite being Blizzard’s first true 3D game), but it also enjoyed the same sort of unrelenting balance and fluid gameplay that characterized all of their titles. So how is it that Blizzard retained its almost legendary Midas touch throughout the ages?Roper gives an interview in ‘Game Design: Secrets of the Sages’, a book published by BradyGames in 2000, where he explains it quite well: “While game designers have to keep a lot of balls in the air at once, the single most important factor is your audience. Never lose sight of who the game is made for and what they want and expect out of the product.[…] We also play a lot of games at Blizzard and view them with a critical eye for ideas, both good and bad. During every phase of the design process, we kept our audience in mind; core gamers who demand longevity with involving strategic gameplay and more casual gamers who need to be able to play the game just by sitting down with the keyboard and mouse. Our goal was to make the game easy to learn but difficult to master…”“We have always been focused on creating the best games possible and have remained dedicated to not releasing a game until it meets the standards that both we and our fans have set. While this is a very difficult path to follow, especially when the end of the year approaches and the game just isn’t done, it is the guiding tenet of our company and has served us very well if the sales and following that Diablo and StarCraft have generated are any indication.”The menu screen for WarCraft: Orcs & HumansGameplay from WarCraft Adventures.Gameplay from Warcraft III.

      "Blizzard Entertainment is a PC game developer and publisher. Since its release of Warcraft in 1994, it has been one of the most successful game development studios in the world. Its headquarters are based in Irvine, California. The company has a history of largely overshooting release dates. However, many Blizzard fans see this as somewhat of a blessing in disguise, as Blizzard has a reputation for producing classic games that are played for years to come.  Blizzard also has a reputation for taking fierce legal action against anyone who reverse engineers their software, copies their game concepts, or publishes third-party server software that is compatible with their games.Blizzard Entertainment was founded in February, 1991 as Silicon & Synapse by Mike Morhaime, Allen Adham and Frank Pearce. The company developed games like Rock & Roll Racing and The Lost Vikings (published by Interplay Productions). In 1994, the company briefly changed its name to Chaos Studios, before finally settling on Blizzard Entertainment after it was discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed. That same year, they were acquired by distributor Davidson & Associates for under USD$10 million. Shortly thereafter, Blizzard shipped their breakthrough hit Warcraft.Blizzard has changed hands several times since then: Davidson was acquired by a timeshare company called CUC International in 1996; CUC then merged with a hotel, real-estate, and car-rental franchiser called HFS Corporation to form Cendant Software, in 1997. In 1998 it became apparent that CUC had engaged in accounting fraud for years before the merger; Cendant's stock lost 80% of its value over the next six months in the ensuing widely discussed accounting scandal. The company sold its consumer software operations, including Blizzard, to French publisher Havas in 1998, the same year Havas was purchased by Vivendi. Blizzard is now part of the VU Games group of Vivendi Universal.In 1996, Blizzard acquired Condor Games, which had been working on the game Diablo for Blizzard at the time. Condor was renamed Blizzard North, and has since developed hit games Diablo, Diablo II, and its expansion pack Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. Blizzard North was located in San Mateo, California.Blizzard launched their online gaming service Battle.net in January of 1997 with the release of their action-RPG Diablo.On November 23, 2004, Blizzard released World of Warcraft, which has grown to become one of the most popular MMORPGs in history.On May 16, 2005, Blizzard announced the acquisition of Swingin' Ape, a console game maker, which is now Blizzard Console, currently working on Starcraft: Ghost, but in March 2006 (last mentioned on the website on March 30, 2006) they announced that Starcraft: Ghost was on indefinite hold.On August 1, 2005, Blizzard announced the consolidation of Blizzard North into the headquarters in Irvine, California.A few months after the closure of Blizzard North, Bill Roper, Erich Schaefer and his brother Max Schaefer co-founded Flagship Studios which now is developing Mythos (on July 19, 2008 it was announced that due to continuing financial hardships at Flagship Studios, Mythos would be going on hiatus)  and Hellgate London released in the fall of 2007.Blizzard is currently a division of Activision Blizzard, Inc. as a result of a merger that was announced on December 7th, 2007.

      "Two new job postings on the Blizzard website suggest that the developers are working on a brand new first-person title. An old one has also been updated, confirming that the Diablo team is expanding.If you missed BlizzCon 2016, catch up by following our coverage.Blizzard are looking for a lead engine software engineerand a lead tools engineer, both for “unannounced games/projects”.Reading further into the job descriptions, they each mention that the project “utilises a robust first-person engine”. “Experience working on first-person or other action-oriented games” is listed as a plus for both jobs.That Blizzard is advertising for staff to develop a game engine and its content creation tools, apparently from scratch, suggests that the project is right at the beginning of development, and yet is ambitious.In other vague job news, a little while ago we reported that Blizzard were recruiting an outsourcing manager for another unannounced project. That listing has now been changed from “unannounced project” to simply “Diablo” – not Diablo 4, just plain Diablo. The description has been updated as well, but only to say that the team “is expanding”. The job itself involves managing internal and external art teams to create art assets for Diablo. Given what we’ve just heard from BlizzCon about the Necromancer class and a remake of the original Diablo within Diablo III, this doesn’t necessarily mean you should expect a Diablo 4 announcement soon.The possible new shooter is an interesting development, however, given that Blizzard only launched their first-ever shooter this year and has big plans for it in the Overwatch League. Perhaps we’ll see a more PvE- or narrative-focused shooter from Blizzard next, driven by their famously compelling loot, quest or level-up systems. Maybe Blizzard have decided that reviving Ghost is the best way to develop the StarCraft IP.

      "It’s been twenty years since the incantations of dark rituals first echoed from the cathedral buried beneath Tristram and the denizens of the Burning Hells were unleashed upon Sanctuary under the command of the series’ titular villain, Diablo. Since then, millions of players have experienced the intense and enthralling gameplay that’s become a hallmark of the series. Here’s to twenty more!In 1996, Blizzard Entertainment released Diablo®, merging fast-paced point-and-click action with the character customization and progression found in traditional role-playing games. With immense replayability, memorable music, and a brooding atmosphere, Diablo defined the action-RPG genre, influencing many games to follow.At BlizzCon 2016, we gathered a group of veteran demon slayers to spill their guts about what Diablo means to them. Check out the video to relive powerful memories from Sanctuary, as retold by Diablo developers past and presentIn Diablo, you took up arms as a valiant Rogue, Sorcerer, or Warrior scouring the catacombs beneath the troubled town of Tristram to face an evil that threatened to infest the entire world—the Dark Lord, Diablo.Diablo was released for both Mac and Windows PCs, a rarity at the time; to face a threat this menacing, it was critical to recruit as many potential heroes as possible. In addition to pitting players against a seemingly endless horde of vile, demonic, and undead creatures, Diablo also empowered those hungry for a more social gaming experience through our trailblazing online service, Battle.net. In its first month of operation, Battle.net brought players together in more than 1.5 million games.Diablo II brought a four Act structure to the series, with heroes traveling to distant lands over the course of their quest to cleanse Sanctuary of evil. In Diablo II, you battled several of the most sinister forces of the Burning Hells, including Duriel, the Lord of Pain; Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred; and Diablo, the Lord of Terror. As players became embroiled in the conflict between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells, the Diablo series become recognized for its unique approach to traditional “good vs. evil” storytelling.Diablo II’s five unique classes (Amazon, Barbarian, Necromancer, Paladin, and Sorceress) broadened the core archetypes of the previous game, and the customizable skill trees made these classes feel unique. New mechanics—socketed items, gems, dual wielding, hirelings, and more—rounded out the series’ feeling of constant progression, and of developing your hero to your specifications. Updates to Battle.net made it easier than ever for you to party up, engage in thrilling duels, hunt down valuable artifacts, and compete for a spot on the ladder—all while adventuring online.In Diablo II: Lord of Destruction®, you hunted down Baal, the last of the Prime Evils, as he ravaged the Barbarians of Arreat in search of the Worldstone, a priceless relic tied into the fabric of the world of Sanctuary. Lord of Destruction also added two new classes to Diablo II’s roster: the Druid, a versatile master of shape-shifting, summoning, and elemental magic; and the Assassin, a practitioner of mental disciplines, skilled in the use of traps and deadly martial arts.Diablo II’s already prodigious item list expanded with rune words, charms, jewels, and new item properties like “ethereal.” Changes to the game allowed hirelings to level up and equip items, laying the groundwork for Diablo III’s followers.Twenty years after the destruction of the Worldstone and the Prime Evils’ banishment from Sanctuary, rumors of a fallen star brought heroes to the rebuilt town of Tristram in search of an omen of the end times.In addition to Barbarians—returning from Diablo II—players could now portray Demon Hunters, Monks, Witch Doctors or Wizards, and choose between male or female variants of each character class, a first for the series. Diablo III’s unique skill system allowed players to switch their abilities at will, incorporating unparalleled flexibility and experimentation into the series. All-new artisans brought additional depth to the crafting of gems and equipment that have become a big part of Diablo’s identity.When Malthael, the Angel of Death, stole the Black Soulstone containing the essence of the seven Prime Evils, the fallen Archangel of Justice, Tyrael, charged you with finding and stopping Malthael before he could bend the Stone’s infernal power to his will. You explored the sprawling streets of Westmarch and ventured deep into the Pandemonium Fortress in a desperate bid to stop death itself.Diablo III: Reaper of Souls™ added a new class (the Crusader) as well as a new Act to explore. It also included Adventure Mode, a brand new way to experience Diablo through bounties and Nephalem Rifts, randomized dungeons that meld the deadliest locales of Sanctuary with dangerous demons, taking the game’s substantial replayability to a whole new level.Coming in 2017, the Rise of the Necromancer pack will bring the priests of Rathma, commanders of the dead, to Diablo III: Reaper of Souls. The pack will also give players access to additional character slots, an in-game pet, and more. Watch the preview video and the BlizzCon presentations below to learn more.We look to Diablo’s legacy and our passionate player community for inspiration. You drive us to keep making Diablo an enjoyable experience for everyone. We hope you’ll continue to enjoy playing for many years to come.",

      "By\nTom Senior\n2016-12-12T17:50:34.346ZThe Diablo series is an epic story of heaven vs. hell, in which heaven really takes a back seat and lets one dude handle the entire war. That hero is you, and whether you're a Paladin, a Monk or a Barbarian, to get the job done you're going to have to kill a lot of little guys and a few greater demons, steal their stuff, level up and grow from an ordinary wanderer into a demi-god. It's the best action RPG series ever. Hell, Diablo basically defines the genre. But which one is worth playing today? Here we go, from worst to best.It may be a genre-defining classic—one of the 50 most important games on PC, in fact—Diablo is a historical curio by today's standards. You can't even get it on Blizzard's Battle.Net store and if you were to acquire it, good luck getting it running on a modern machine. Luckily, a homage to the first game's 16-tier dungeon is coming to Diablo 3, though I wonder if it will capture the first game's sense of horror. The eerie music, distorted monster screams and dark pixel art created a sense of occult dread that would have seemed much edgier in 1996 during the twilight years of the satanic panic. The whole series sits at odds with Blizzard's modern family-friendly direction, but Diablo 1 in particular feels like the the dusty forgotten grimoire in Blizzard's attic, the one old-hands warn interns to stay away from.The tone was lost by the sequels (Diablo 2 is sometimes misremembered as being a much darker game than it actually is) but Diablo 1 laid down the foundations for the rest of the series—interesting loot, archetypal character classes, repetition and randomisation, multiplayer. It might seem like a simple formula now—Gauntlet in dark robes with a sweet loot system—but it made the RPG fast, accessible and exciting.There was an expansion for Diablo 1 called Hellfire. It was handled by Sierra rather than Blizzard North. It added the monk class, which would return many years later in Diablo 3, as well as new levels, bosses and items. It was okay.Error 37, an always-online requirement, the auction house, agonising drop rates, dull loot—Diablo 3 had many problems at launch, but it committed two major sins that inform the rest of the game's mistakes. First sin: it was not Diablo 2. This was always going to be a challenge for a series that generates so much nostalgic passion, but if this game had been a lot more like Diablo 2, it would never have been Diablo 2 enough for some. Remaking D2 in a 3D engine would have been a pointless exercise, and it's much more interesting to see a design team form a fresh take on the idea.Second sin, the big one: in some respects, Diablo 3 didn't seem to understand why people like Diablo. The auction house attempted to legitimise the black markets that sprang up around Diablo 2 and created incentives for players to farm and sell high-level items in the endgame. It also gave Blizzard a cut of every transaction. You might argue that the enthusiasm for Diablo 2's items markets suggested that players would see the auction house as a feature. Some did, but many did not. Combat, loot, hordes of enemies, big boss monsters—these are all key tenants of a Diablo game. Shopping, not so much.Putting the long-dead auction house aside, there's a very decent, occasionally exceptional Diablo game here. The first act is too long. The fourth act is dull and repetitive. The third act, however, is just right. I have lost count of the times I have cleared the battlements of Bastion's Keep, fought through the battlefield below, to obliterate the siegebreaker beast. The varied elevation of the keep gives you great views of the assault below—it's one of the most spectacular sections of the series.The rethought classes, skills and progression systems take a smart step away from Diablo 2. I look forward to using my Diablo 2 favourite—the Necromancer—in next year's pack, but after hundreds of hours spent wearing skull pauldrons in D2, I enjoyed the violent excess of the Witch Doctor's exploding frogs. The use of ability slots and ability modifiers encourage a more experimental approach to class building. The journey to level 60 represents an incremental widening of your toolbox, where a traditional skill tree system otherwise lock you into a build.Iconic classes, varied acts, a wealth of procedurally generated dungeons and a new cast of high demons put dripping flesh onto the sparse structure established by Diablo 1. The sequel lost some of the mystique of Diablo 1’s mostly context-free plunge into the netherworld, but recast the player as a hero fighting the entire hierarchy of hell. Instead of sending the player back into the original’s gloomy crypts, the sequel drew the demons out and scattered them across grey human settlements, golden deserts and a massive jungle.With the return of Deckard Cain, the series started to establish its own canon, as Blizzard games do. In the process the gothic menace of Diablo 1 evolved into something more colourful, but no less metal. Coming from a diet of Tolkien and The Forgotten Realms via Baldur’s Gate, my teenage brain lapped it up. Diablo 2 blew away the dialogue-heavy fustiness I associated with RPGs, and instead let me cut down thousands of enemies with enchanted weapons and cool spells.It's a classic, albeit one you need a few mods to enjoy on a widescreen monitor today. It's sad to have to squint at such tiny pixels on a modern high-resolution screen, but Diablo 2's sprites are still characterful and expressive, and still send me back to my CRT monitor days when I would team up with friends on a dodgy 56k modem. Diablo 2 is the bible from which modern action RPG developers draw inspiration. The gritty worlds of Path of Exile and Grim Dawn owe a debt to the game that, for many fans, represents Blizzard’s finest work.Diablo 2 was great, but only felt complete after the Lord of Destruction expansion. That’s not to say that Diablo 2 was unfinished in any way, but the systemic expansion offered by Lord of Destruction made it impossible to go back As we’ll see, this is the start of a budding trend for Diablo games.The expansion added the assassin and the druid, a terrific new act set in the Barbarian sanctuaries of Mount Arreat, and introduced new ways to customise your equipment with runes and jewels. The additional classes were decent, Act V is the best Diablo 2 act and the deepened itemisation system (which included a trove of new unique items and a bunch of new recipes for the magic Horadric Cube forge) sustained new difficulty levels and gave Diablo 2 its extensive endgame. The expansion also made a wealth of small quality-of-life tweaks that collectively greatly improve the base game. It’s hard to imagine Diablo 2 without a permanently visible minimap, the generous Lord of Destruction stash size and the full range of skill keybinding slots.The time I spent battling through Lord of Destruction with my pals’ Barbarian and Druid characters represents some of the best co-op experience I’ve ever enjoyed on my PC. Today, however, the multiplayer scene has largely dissipated (though there are heroic players out there still). It is hard to go back. Diablo 2: LoD was an immense game for its time, but its time has passed. Lord of Destruction lived and died with its community. It flourished in its golden age, fostered some great memories, and then faded into the annals of PC gaming history. All those moments lost, like fanboy tears in the putrid rain of Baal’s vengeance. As Deckard Cain might put it in his weird old-man drawl, “taaarm to dieaaaaargh”.Diablo 3’s expansion was the culmination of a time of great reform. Blizzard sank the auction house, revamped loot rates and added new items. The expansion added a fifth act, a fine new villain in Malthael, and the fantastic Crusader class. By the end of the process, Diablo 3 felt new. Adventure mode disrupted the farming patterns the knowledgeable tier of the community had established, sending players back into forgotten zones—“hey, I forgot this ridiculously large spider cave” I thought, traipsing back through Act I. Items dropped less frequently, but were actually relevant to your class. Unique items came with exotic new abilities, and synergised with class skills in a way that could suddenly make a new build worth trying.Rebalanced and revitalised, Diablo 3 suddenly became a solid platform for a new expansion. As Lord of Destruction did before it, Reaper of Souls produced some of the best zones in the game. The streets of Westmarch achieved a new degree of winding, organic complexity—a great improvement on the endless recurring grids of Act IV. The battle on top of the huge battering ram showed a new eye for set-pieces. The final winding pathway to Malthael was a beautiful departure from the burning red hues of most other Diablo 3 boss arenas. The expansion hints at a future for Diablo that pushes greater environmental spectacle as the player decimates ever-larger hordes. As an added bonus, Malthael’s evil mist and energy ball attacks actually presented a challenge.The heavy, crunchy Crusader class thrived on the heft of Diablo 3’s combat. Diablo 2’s sprites were great, but couldn’t pop and ragdoll through the corridors. It still feels amazing to send the Crusader into the sky and watch them slam back down with a thunderclap. This isn’t even that great a skill for the Crusader, but like so many of Diablo 3’s abilities, it’s fun to use repeatedly. The Crusader’s ghost armies, hard-hitting skills and love of smiting created a fresh melee style, successfully re-concepting Diablo 2’s dull Paladin in the process.This list has been a battle of heart vs. head. My rosy memories of fine times in Lord of Destruction will always tempt me to put it at the top, but if I had to recommend a game from the series to play right now—which I do because that is the entire purpose of this exercise—then Diablo 3, revamped by the outstanding Reaper of Souls expansion and a vigorous post-launch update campaign, takes the prize. Here I commend my verdict to the masses.

      "﻿Rush posted about the current issue of US PC Gamer with their D3 cover story a few days ago, but I wanted to compare the UK and US editions of the magazine. Both use the official Blizzcon 2008 artwork, but as you can see in the thumbnails, they have different captions. The US cover is on top (larger view here). It says, “Diablo III leads the top games of 09” a caption clearly designed to spur debate over whether or not D3 will be released in this calendar year. There doesn’t seem to be anything new about D3 inside the issue, unfortunately: .“None of the info in the article is new, but they do have an interview with Rob Pardo on the next page discussing other Blizz games.”Here’s the UK cover, with the same image but a different caption. It says, “Why Blizzard Rule 2009.” The specific focus on D3 isn’t there, despite the articles inside the magazine being much the same. One is posted online, and it gives a general overview of why (in PC Gamer’s fluffing opinion) Blizzard games are so great. Here’s the intro:It’s not a huge mystery, but it’s an interesting question. Why the difference in the PC Gamer cover story approaches? Controversy sells more in the US? US gamers are more impatient and must be promised (by media, if not Blizzard) that games are coming out much sooner than they actually will? Diablo III is a bigger draw in the US while UK games are more interested in Blizzard on the whole?Copyright 2018 | Enthusiast Gaming. All Rights ReservedInformationConnectionsSubmitAdvertising",
      "After more than three years in the making, Diablo II has finally arrived. The belated sequel is easily one of the most anticipated computer games of all time, so it's not surprising that Blizzard North has managed to produce another highly entertaining and accessible game. But while its hack-and-slash gameplay will seem instantly familiar to those who played its predecessor, Diablo II is a more complex and much larger game, which helps explain its extended production. However, in exchange for the additional complexity and size, you'll have to tolerate low-resolution graphics and a few more gameplay problems than you might have come to expect from Blizzard games.Although it was hugely successful both commercially and critically, the original Diablo was criticized for its relatively short single-player game and solitary dungeon setting. Diablo II is set in a much larger gaming world, and its action isn't isolated to a single locale. Divided into four distinct acts, each with its own setting, Diablo II now permits outdoor exploration in addition to a predictable series of dungeon crawls, although the outdoor areas aren't terribly interesting in and of themselves. The overall goal of Diablo II is exactly the same as it was in the first game, namely to hack through hordes of monsters to gain items and enhance your abilities so you can confront and speedily dispatch the resident Lord of Terror, Diablo. This time around there's a better story to serve as the framework for the slaughter, as each of the game's acts is linked together with impressively produced and lengthy cinematic cutscenes. The quests you receive are no longer random, as they were in the single-player version of the original game, and collectively the tasks in each act are loosely linked together to make the overall story more cohesive. Diablo II's primary focus is still on action-oriented gameplay, but the more sophisticated presentation of the cutscenes and the additional plot depth give the action context and more relevance than in the original game.The actual gameplay still consists almost exclusively of killing monsters to gain treasure and experience points. Since your character constantly gains more and more formidable abilities and weaponry, that relatively simple style of play proves to be just as addictive as it was in the original Diablo and in other games that have since exploited the same formula. It's difficult to extract yourself from a game that always keeps you on the verge of being rewarded for another achievement.Early in the game, that otherwise effective blueprint is overused, since swarms of weak creatures are hurled at you. The game is so easy until the end of act one that it gets tiresome wading through crowds of pathetic beasts, several of which are less fearsome versions of counterparts from the original game. The lack of resulting tension is noticeable, especially since the first Diablo increased its difficulty very quickly by requiring relatively inexperienced characters to battle behemoths such as the Butcher and the Skeleton King. There isn't a similarly difficult showdown in Diablo II until the very end of the first act, although there are plenty of challenging confrontations after that point in the game. Blizzard has always seemed intent on producing games that are extremely intuitive for new players; with Diablo II, the developers may have been concerned that neophytes would find all of the new character skill choices intimidating and accordingly structured the game so that the early stages would give you a less stressful opportunity to get accustomed to the new character development system. In addition, since the graphics for the creatures and areas at the beginning of game were also created quite early in the game's development, they are substantially worse than those that appear further into the game. The first act of the game is generally not representative of the quality and challenge of its remainder.More experienced players may be bored early in the game because of the lack of difficulty, but they'll certainly appreciate the additional character development options. In addition to there now being five player-character classes instead of just three, the differences between the new classes are more significant than they were in the original game. In Diablo, while each of the classes had different strengths and inherently performed some actions better than the other classes, there were only a couple of unique class skills. In Diablo II the character development system has been overhauled, and almost all skills are unique to a particular class. In addition, you get to select which skills your character acquires or improves, so even characters of the same class can develop completely differently. Similarly, whereas the original game's mana attribute simply determined a character's spell points, it's been redefined into a more broadly useful attribute that all character classes need to keep track of. The increased differentiation between classes and the more expansive selection of skills appreciably enhance the game's replay value, especially since Blizzard did a good job of making each class interesting. While the additional complexity may make Diablo II a little less accessible to casual gamers, it's definitely the game's most significant improvement over Diablo.On the other hand, the graphics in Diablo II are disappointing, especially when compared with those in the original game. When Diablo was released at the end of 1996, its SVGA graphics were amazing. More than three years later, those low-resolution graphics no longer look impressive and barely look adequate, and yet that's all Diablo II offers. There are some notable graphical improvements, such as the game's lighting and translucency effects and the new parallax scrolling that gives a 3D gloss to otherwise flat objects, but the game's 2D graphics are generally disappointing and look pixelated and lack sharpness on larger monitors.The graphics are also almost constantly obscured by the game's automap function. You can turn the map off or dim its brightness, but the game's outdoor environments make the map even more necessary for navigation than it was previously, so most of the time it'll be blocking your view of the game world. There should have at least been an option to display a smaller version of the automap in a corner of the screen where it wouldn't intrude as noticeably. Fortunately, the developers made some tweaks to the game's design and interface, and the resulting improvements are noticeable, even though they may not go far enough. For one thing, the game has no discernible loading-time transitions between areas - only between acts. In addition, instead of having to constantly mouse-click to initiate attacks, you can now just hold the mouse button down to continuously attack a creature, which limits the amount of tedious mouse-clicking that was required in the original. There are also additional hotkeys available for skills or spells, but there still aren't enough available to give quick access to all of a character's useful abilities. Surprisingly, Westwood's Nox did a better job of granting you quick access to an area map and your character's abilities, spells, and items, even though accessibility was a key strength of the original Diablo.While Diablo's cooperative multiplayer mode was undeniably addictive and included a variety of difficulty levels unavailable in the single-player game, players still complained about the fact that most of the game's quests were only accessible in the game's single-player mode. In Diablo II, the single-player and multiplayer modes are almost identical, and all of the quests and difficulty levels are available in both versions of the game. Multiplayer Diablo didn't permit you to save the game whenever you wanted, and a character's death resulted in a hazardous and ill-equipped trip back to the same dangerous area to retrieve the character's valuables. The designers of Diablo II apparently believed the resulting tension generated by the multiplayer mode of the original game was worth porting to the single-player mode, because that's the only way to save your game in the sequel. You can no longer save the game whenever you want, and when a game is saved (either automatically or when you exit a session), new monsters are generated to populate the gaming world. There are waypoints that can be activated so you can get back relatively close to where your character was last exploring, but creatures will have respawned in that area, even if it was previously cleared out. Leaving a game without using the \"save and exit\" option in the main menu could result in the loss of recently acquired booty. While the new system does prevent you from constantly reverting to saved games and robbing yourself of the thrill of danger while exploring a new area, it's a design decision that's bound to frustrate some players.The most significant problem with multiplayer Diablo was that it was too easy for hackers to create powerful magic items and alter character attributes and other data files, since all of the game data was stored locally, on players' hard drives. Within a couple of weeks of Diablo's release, it was virtually impossible to play a non-password-protected game on Blizzard's free Internet Battle.net server without being harassed by players solely intent on ruining other players' games with their unnaturally overpowered characters. Battle.net now has an optional archive to store character data, which should finally cure the hacking problems that plagued the original game, since would-be cheaters won't be able to alter that data anymore.Blizzard's Battle.net Internet servers, which were initially launched concurrently with the release of the original Diablo, have proven to be unable to cope with the number of players currently trying to play Diablo II online. Gameplay has so far proven to be laggy, which is surprising considering Diablo II played well during beta testing and the original game played smoothly online. Once additional capacity is added, Battle.net should be a more accessible and enjoyable option, which is particularly relevant since features such as worldwide rankings and the game's hard-core mode are only available online. Blizzard does deserve credit for adding the hard-core version of the game, which prevents you from resurrecting slain characters no matter how many hours have been devoted to developing them. This feature makes for a truly tense and exciting gaming experience - it's an option that many won't dare try, but death for a character in Diablo's spiritual predecessors, Nethack and Rogue, could have similarly brutal consequences, and those games proved to have enduring appeal.The development team for Diablo II clearly made it a priority to respond to all of the perceived problems with the original game, and players will likely appreciate most, if not all, of the resulting design changes. Diablo II offers a larger gaming world, the opportunity to play an open multiplayer game without being intruded upon by cheating players, and a more complex and interesting character development system. While its graphics appear somewhat dated, Diablo II has incredible replay value, and most importantly, it offers a lot of addictive gameplay in either the single-player or the multiplayer mode.We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.Use your keyboard!",

      "Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo revolutionized the computer role-playing game genre in 1996. While the game retained the fantasy trappings, loot reward systems, and experience progression mechanics of other RPGs, Diablo introduced fast-paced real-time combat to the mix. In addition, maps in Diablo were procedurally generated, meaning every player would experience a slightly different challenge. This kept the game fresh even for players who had poured dozens of hours into the title. Diablo, its Hellfire expansion, its sequel Diablo II, and that game's Lord of Destruction expansion were all smash hits for the still-young studio.The most recent game in the series, Diablo III in 2012 (along with its later expansions), continued the series' amazing track record. With over 30 million units sold across PCs and consoles, it ranks as one of the best-selling games of all time. Clearly, the market likes going to hell. As one of Blizzard's core properties, there's no doubt that a Diablo 4 is either in discussion or actively in the works at the Irvine, CA studio.And yet, for all that, it may not be coming anytime soon. Blizzard is one of the most unique developers in the industry, willing and able to iterate through different design prototypes for ages. Where any other studio would want to crank out a sequel for a quick buck, Blizzard has other priorities, and they are keeping Diablo 4 from your screens for the next little while. Here's why Blizzard won't release it — yet.Blizzard will spend more time crafting a game than nearly any other company in the industry, even if that means working on a single game for over a decade. The Diablo II expansion Lord of Destruction arrived in 2001, and like its predecessors, set the gaming world on fire with its slick design and wicked atmosphere. The team behind the franchise, Blizzard North, figured one expansion was enough, and thus began working on the next full release in the franchise. And they worked on it. And worked on it. And worked on it some more.For reasons that have never been publicly explained, Blizzard headquarters then decided to shutter their North branch in 2005. Along with that closure, they also decided to cancel all of the work that had been done on the new Diablo game up to that time. The Irvine crew formed a brand-new team to build a new Diablo III from scratch. This game would not see the light of day until 2012, fully seven years after the restart, which itself was begun four years after the original project.Blizzard has been blessed with a lot of success, so they have enough resources to pour into a single title over this kind of time. And with Diablo III, they proved they were willing to do so. So just because that game turned out to be a blockbuster doesn't mean that Diablo 4 is right around the corner. After all, it's only been a few years since the third game released. To Blizzard, that's less than the blink of an eye.So why does Blizzard spend so much time on development? Because for them, anything that isn't absolutely perfect won't do. Since the release of the original Warcraft: Orcs & Humans in 1994, the company has built up a reputation for the highest levels of innovation and quality. Their games aren't just 'good,' and they are not just 'influential': they are polished masterpieces that either define or redefine their genres. World of Warcraft. StarCraft. Overwatch. Hearthstone. It's a remarkable legacy.But even this studio can't strike solid gold every time. Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans was intended to be Blizzard's foray into the adventure game space. But once the project was effectively complete, it wasn't a genre-leading title: it was just another game. Blizzard wouldn't accept that, and cancelled a complete game that was ready to be released and earn money. Very few companies would ever think to do such a thing.They repeated this trick a few years later with StarCraft: Ghost, a brilliant-looking action game that, much like its protagonist, vanished before our eyes. And of course, there was that original version of Diablo III, which probably would have been another smash hit if Blizzard had only released it. Instead, they cancelled it, and spent another seven years crafting a different game with the same name.In other words, Blizzard's reputation — not games — is their core product. Anything that might, just might, harm it is cancelled or restarted. So they don't care if Diablo 4 is really great and ready to release soon; they would sooner start over from scratch and make it perfect.Eleven years, who knows how many dollars, and an endless amount of hype all resulted in one thing: the long-awaited release of Diablo III worldwide on May 15, 2012. Needless to say, old-school fans had been looking forward to this moment for over a decade. Even new players who loved Blizzard products were excited to try out the company's latest adventure. They bought the game. They installed it. They hit \"Play.\"But they lost to the ultimate boss: Error 37.This was the internal error code for a failure to connect to Blizzard's servers, a pervasive problem upon the game's release. Even though Diablo III had a single-player mode, everyone had to connect to the servers for some reason. And in this case, that meant a whole lot of people couldn't even play the product they'd just purchased. It took weeks for Blizzard to sort out the mess, but by then, a bad taste had been left in the mouths of a lot of dedicated fans. Blizzard's sterling reputation had taken a dent.Meanwhile, the game's Auction House system also turned out to be a problem. Intended to allow players to easily share loot they didn't want, for money if they so chose, the system instead ruined the overall progression path of the game. Eventually, the system was removed from the game altogether. Another failure for a company that hated that word.For Diablo 4, Blizzard will want to ensure a smooth player experience, and make sure any problematic systems are cut out before release. That'll take time. And Blizzard, of all companies, won't hesitate to wait if it means getting the game right.The main campaign for Diablo III isn't wildly long, and even inexperienced players can probably complete it in 15 to 20 hours. In theory, then, this should be the kind of game that you pick up, play, and then put down forever. Not so! Many players have logged hundreds of hours in Diablo III, and keep coming back for more. There are a lot of reasons for this, but one of the biggest is a system called Seasons.Essentially, a Season is a game-mode that only lasts for a certain period of time. During a Season, a player who opts into the mode will have to start a brand-new character from scratch. This has the effect of setting everyone back to square one: at the start of a Season, everybody runs un-leveled, un-geared heroes again. Blizzard then sets a number of challenges for them to complete, and it's a race to see who among the community, or who among your friends, can complete them first. Since everybody's starting from the same point, the race is one that anyone can win. Meanwhile, Season-specific rewards can only be earned during this period, and never again, so players are incentivized to try to play as much of each Season as they can.This long-running system has proven to be very popular, and it keeps an old game alive in the hearts of millions of players. Blizzard doesn't need Diablo 4 to keep the brand thriving: Diablo III is doing that work just fine all by itself, even years after its release.When the original Diablo burst onto the scene in 1996, it transformed what an action game could be. Fast-paced yet tactical, easy to pick up yet difficult to master, it was a near-perfect distillation of everything action games aspired to become, while simultaneously preserving everything that made RPG games such a sensation. The game led the industry forward, and with Diablo II, was a major factor in bringing games into the 21st Century.For all its massive success, Diablo III hasn't been nearly as influential. The third game in the franchise retained the top-down, isometric look of its '90s predecessors, keeping the camera way back from the action. While there are other indie titles that use that style as well, usually as an intentional throwback to a bygone era of gaming, there are no AAA experiences that currently use that format. Modern titles, such as God of War or Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, keep the camera close to the main character and the immediate environment. Rather than giving the player a bird's eye view, these games present a visceral ground-level experience. That also allows for far greater detail in the character models and the animations.Diablo 4, then, will have to reconcile the classic franchise format with these more modern tropes, without alienating old-school fans or potential new players. Otherwise, Diablo will not be a genre-defining series anymore, just a kind of updated relic from another time. Blizzard has no interest in rehashing the past: they want to shape the future. And they will take as much time as they need to hit on a design that does.As mentioned above, Blizzard takes an awful long time making their games. But there's a flip side to that coin: Blizzard has been supporting their active roster for longer and longer. StarCraft II is still getting attention from the company, even seven years after its release. World of Warcraft continues its astonishing run, even though it was released all the way back in 2004. And by all indications, Overwatch and its new eSports league is going to be around for a long, long time to come.To that end, Diablo 4 can't just be a fun game: it needs to be able to support an active fanbase for years. Blizzard may even possibly be looking to make it a long-running game-as-a-service, in which case it may be the only new Diablo game for a decade or more. Building a title that can stand up to that long test of time, and have the infrastructure necessary to constantly push new content, is no small feat: just ask the team that turned the failed Titan project into Overwatch.While the Seasons system in Diablo III has allowed fans to remain engaged with that game, a full-on service-oriented title is a whole new ballgame. Wedding the game-as-a-service philosophy with the tried-and-true Diablo formula will take a lot of care, attention, and, most of all, time. Plus, building out the systems necessary to maintain such a game over the long term is a large endeavor unto itself. Diablo 4 likely won't be the next Diablo III: it will be, in many respects, a bold new direction for the franchise.In 2016, Diablo III lost its director, Josh Mosqueira. Since taking the reins in 2013, Mosqueira had led many of the face-saving initiatives that rescued the game from itself, such as removing the Auction House. He would naturally be the man to lead the franchise into its next installment. But his departure left a hole behind him, and his replacement would have to get up to speed on the still-ongoing Diablo III before tackling a new project. At a bare minimum, this would have slowed down development, and further added to the production schedule.Interestingly, while Blizzard has almost certainly hired a new director, nobody really knows for sure! The company never announced if the role was ever filled, or who filled it. Is this person a veteran member of the Diablo III team? A talented director poached from another studio? A mysterious wanderer with a dark past, hellbent on revenge and redemption? We don't know! Whoever it is, that person will have a lot of work to do, and a massive legacy to live up to, and of course, Blizzard's reputation to manage. It's a lot of responsibility. And the best way to handle that responsibility is patience, and time.Which is yet another reason you won't be seeing Diablo 4 for a while yet."

      "Strange Adventures in Infinite Space was the first game of its kind: a Rogue-like space adventure. Dubbed “A Perfect Short Game” in a Gamasutra article by Ernest Adams, it gathered critical acclaim and eventually spawned a much awaited sequel Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space that brought this style of gameplay to more modern systems with OpenGL graphics and award-winning audio track.Strange Adventures in Infinite Space is also an example of the scratchware concept: professional quality, original games with high replayability, made by just a couple of people with freeware tools for no development cost.After being sold for several years by Cheapass Games, Strange Adventures in Infinite Space was released as free software and its source code was made available under the GNU General Public License.

      "Some of the best quasi-roguelike space games out there are Digital Eel's terrific Infinite Space games: Strange Adventures in Infinite Space, Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space and Sea of Stars: Infinite Space III.  Quick-playing, always challenging, and filled with secrets to discover.  @Play spoke with the principals of Digital Eel, Rich Carlson and Iikka Keränen, about the long-lived series.@P: Tell me about your company -- when was it founded, about the main people and your day jobs?Iikka Keränen: Rich and I unofficially started Digital Eel in 1999 when we both worked at Looking Glass. That's when we bought the domain name and started working on the (never released) 4X strategy game we called Infinite Space. I have been working in the game industry since 1998 when I was hired by Ion Storm in Dallas TX. For the last fifteen years, I've been at Valve.Rich Carlson: I was a musician in Minnesota for 20 years before deciding to try to make games for a living. I met Iikk at Ion. We ended up working at four game studios together! You may recall that Ion Storm, Rogue Entertainment, Looking Glass Studios were all closing, one by one, at the time. That was hard to watch, and hard be a part of but the games turned out well. Meantime, Iikka and I became friends and decided to make some games ourselves for fun. Later, when we came to Seattle for another game job, we met artist Bill Sears working at the same studio. He turned out to be as weird as we are, with a terrific sense of humor, and so we all became fast friends too. That's when Digital Eel was \"officially\" founded. Bill made the splash screen for Plasmaworm and we went on from there as a trio. Henry Kropf is the newest member of the Digital Eel nuclear family. He's been programming professionally for something like 20 years, starting at Vicarious Visions in 1996. (We all started in the game biz at about the same time.) He worked on PC and PS1 projects--the hardcore space-sim, Terminus (Wikipedia), for example. Since then he's worked on a number of projects and ports, most recently for the latter Digital Eel games, as well as being the sole programmer of the fantasy word game SpellBounders (iOS App Store).@P: That's really interesting! The SAIS games have this outsider art feel, I think at least, like they're from some alternate universe where games evolved subtly differently. For some reason it's weird to think you're embedded in the traditional game development community! I find it difficult to believe you'd have the time or energy for this if you guys worked at, for instance, EA. Are you worried that the day job might interfere with the SAIS games?RC: It is outsider art! Although Bill worked at game studios, he came from the era of Kustom Kars, underground comix and lowbrow surrealism. If you've read Juxtapoz or Zap Comix, that's the the realm. That's what you see in Weird Worlds, and on the DE splash screens. 60's and 70's counterculture art (done only as Phosphorus can!)IK: Sometimes it does interfere - Funny that you should mention EA, we actually worked on an EA-published game (American McGee's Alice) after we stopped working on the original Infinite Space \"big game\", and before we made Plasmaworm and SAIS. That was a time when we really didn't have the energy to do our own thing. Valve is much better at not interfering with life outside the office. I think it has to do with it being a more mature company - most people have families and can't be expected to work seven days a week, that sort of stuff.RC: We have to work on our games slowly much of the time. But isn't that best if you can? Slow and steady wins the race. We plan carefully and go step by step. Looking back, 15 games in 14 years says we're finishers not flakes.@P: How did Strange Adventures get started? What are its play inspirations? From whence came the series' unique backstory?IK: We had run out of steam on the original 4X game, and I had realized I needed to learn proper Windows programming as my previous coding experience was DOS-based. As I taught myself DirectX, we made a simple arcade game called Plasmaworm in 2001 and then decided to make another small game using the content we had created for Infinite Space. This is what became Strange Adventures in Infinite Space. I was a big fan of Starflight, and we had also played a Star Trek boardgame that influenced the early design of Strange Adventures quite a bit. At the beginning, we were planning to have text-based mini adventures on each planet, that sort of stuff. But we soon realized that streamlining the game as much as possible was the way to go. We had written a lot of back story for the 1999 \"big game\" and had a very rich universe for you to explore - much more content than you'd ever see in a single session, and that kept the game lively and surprising.RC: Other games we played that were inspiring were Frank Butterfield's Voyage of the BSM Pandora, which turned out to be a kind of proof-of-concept that a big game theme could be condensed into a small, short game yet still convey the feeling, not just the flavor, of a star spanning saga. Though the examples I'm mentioning are fantasy-themed, they played into the design concept directly. Proto-roguelike boardgames like Terrence Donelly's Sorcerer's Cave and Greg Costikyan's Deathmaze, were, like modern full-blown roguelikes like Henzell's Dungeon Crawl and NetHack, strong influences as well.@P: Ah, you said the magic word! Starflight also came up in an interview I did some years back with Tarn Adams of Dwarf Fortress, who also cites it as an inspiration! And Starflight's lead designer Greg Johnson is also one-half of Johnson-Voorsanger, who made ToeJam &amp; Earl, and the prime mover of the current TJ&amp;E sequel/revision! It's starting to seem like Starflight is a secret nexus of inspiration for roguelike developers.RC: Starflight was a big deal. I remember waiting and waiting, exasperated, for the C-64 port to be released. Seemed to take forever but it was worth it. Btw, Starflight's spiritual cousin, Star Control II, strongly influenced the way music is used in Strange Adventures and Weird Worlds.@P: All of those games you mentioned before sound really interesting, especially Greg Costikyan's entry. He's a bit of a NetHack fan himself you know.RC: I didn't. I know he was a hardcore Civ fan. Greg has a fantastic imagination. He's tackled quite a variety of subjects. His ludography is frighteningly impressive. (\"A bibliography is a list of the books you've written; a discography is a list of the music you've recorded; and a ludography is a list of the games you've designed.\" - GC)@P: I'm a bit interested in that 4X game you mentioned. Is that project entirely abandoned or might it reappear someday? Or alternatively, do you feel it's important to be able to abandon a project that's no longer working, or gone in uninteresting directions?IK: We have abandoned a few projects for various reasons. The big 4X game was one - it was just too ambitious for us to finish, too similar to some other games, like Master of Orion, and I didn't really know how to do multi-player code at the time (plus the whole MS-DOS thing!). It was a good choice to switch to smaller projects.RC: For us it's about being caught by something. Like when you get into Game of Thrones or Magic: The Gathering. Only the special, best things capture you. That's what we wait for and pounce on when it shows up!IK: Even if we do decide to make a 4X style game in the Infinite Space universe, it will not be the old project resurrected. But it's interesting how much \"stuff\" from it appears in Sea of Stars - for example, the races and most of the items etc have a direct lineage to the old 4X project.@P: You're calling the games \"space roguelikes,\" could you explain, or even justify, that statement?IK: Right, our games don't exactly look like the typical fantasy roguelike! But they do play like one in many ways. We have the procedurally generated maps, high level of randomness and the sense of being dropped in a world that's bigger than what you can experience in one play-through. There's no saving and reloading, so all your actions are permanent. There are tons of items and it's up to the player to figure out how to best use them. I'm a big fan of traditional roguelikes as well, so I know the dissimilarities too, of course. For a while, we used the moniker \"Roguelike-like\" but it's a bit clumsy.RC: Strange Adventures and the rest of the series pass the test in most cases, yet they must be termed as hybrids. I've looked at the Berlin Interpretation and have thought a lot about this. We respect the pure roguelike form very much, for all of the good reasons. We do sometimes say these games are space roguelikes--but in the same way that FTL was termed that. The primary reason is that it is the best way to describe the Infinite Space gameplay, overall, with just one word. Describing SAIS as \"space strategy\" or \"adventure strategy\" or \"strategy rpg\" doesn't convey the gameplay experience at all!@P: I didn't mean to imply that your games couldn't be roguelikes, we've certainly covered enough games that blur the lines! And I agree that \"roguelike-like\" is a bit clumsy, as you've probably witnessed, there's a bit of confusion on the proper way to identify games that are inspired by Rogue's randomness and replayable elements but aren't strictly top-down, tactical combat, dungeon exploration.RC: We have to remember that the first makers of roguelikes didn't invent the Berlin list. Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson did. A roguelike is what it is (a randomized, turn-based D&amp;D/Tolkien themed dungeon survival sim on a grid) because early roguelike creators were emulating the features of their favorite game. So, while the venerable roguelike form can number and claim these traits, it can't really own them.@P: Describe the basic \"explore a space in a limited time\" gameplay.RC: One roguelike aspect that isn't always mentioned--I don't think it's on the Berlin list--is clocks. Food clock. Radiation exposure clock. Spell duration clocks. Thirst clock. Poison damage clock. Etc. If one of these clocks time out, your character is in trouble, which adds more tension to the game. Awesome! I think clocks are an essential part of a roguelike game. Sea of Stars, Weird Worlds and Strange Adventures use clocks too. The primary one is to return to player character's homeworld within a set period of time or suffer a reward penalty. This victory condition mirrors somewhat the idea of Star Trek's \"five year mission\", or Darwin's voyage, or a pirate adventure for that matter.@P: The alien races provide a good mix of beings to interact with, each of which presenting their own personality in behavior, text and combat. Any favorites?RC: I really like one of the new species we added to Sea of Stars, the Calatians. They're mentioned in the previous games but actually make an appearance in IS3 as a full-fledged race. They boast of their mighty ships and fearsome weaponry that appear in conbat as small and unthreatening. Are they bluffing? (Tip: If you're nice to them, you might even get rewarded with one to add to your flotilla.)IK: The Tchorak have been my favorite for a long time, just because they are so... alien. Of course, I know much more about them than you'll see in any of our games, but I hope you'll get to know them better one of these days.RC: I can't wait to explain the sex life of a Tchorak. Or maybe I can.@P: Secret item features (Like \"hypervision,\" or the Lookout Frogs & Toy Robot, or the Crystal Fish?) What inspired them? Why don't more items have these features? Is there a magic number?IK: These items are a bit like a card that allows you to break one specific rule in a boardgame - they're limited by the number of rules that can be broken in a useful way. I do agree we should think of more, there are probably fun things that we've missed.RC: What Iikka said. There is a sweet spot where it feels good and we sort of \"call it.\" But it's also a matter of seeing a possibile connection that might be interesting or entertaining or, more importantly, useful. If the designer puts a ship thief in the game, she should put one or two things in to help the player prevent theft as well.@P: One-in-eight games in the original two Infinite Space games are \"mission games,\" where the game rules change slightly and unexpectedly in the middle of play? What inspired them?IK: I think it was at least partly inspired by some random events in 4X games, like Master of Orion where occasionally a \"space amoeba\" appears and starts to wreak havoc. In Strange Adventures we just had one, and we didn't want it to happen every time because that would have made the game very repetitive, so we made it fairly rare. Now, in Sea of Stars we have five different missions (and counting...) and we can just randomly pick one.RC: These games are intended to be like instant space opera generators, so it stands to reason that every once in a while a chance to \"save the galaxy,\" or save your character's homeworld, etc., should be included. It also breaks the game up from session to session, enhancing replayabilty, we hope, by helping to keep things fresh and surprising.@P: One interesting thing about Weird Worlds in particular is how frequently one can come up non-combat, or what we might call \"instant win\" solutions to game problems, like [SPOILERS] Mirroring enemy fleets into black holes, Vacuum Collapsing the Yellow Kawangii or using the Chromium Gong on Primordius. These solutions seems to be deprecated somewhat in Sea of Stars in favor of more traditional combat. Is there a particular reason?IK: With the exception of the mirror, these still work :) But we have tried to balance some items to make them less game-breaking - the gong no longer has unlimited uses, the hyperdrive is not always the best choice, and so on. This is mainly done to keep the game challenging even if you find the item.@P: On the play changes with each version. Especially the substantial formula changes in Sea of Stars (Maj. Brass prologue dropped, set sector size, no need to return home at end, all mission games, removal of popular earlier items like Aetheric Mirror and Mantle of Babulon.) Was this to fix a perceived lack in the earlier games? Is the new game's 3D starmap related to them? Will we see any of these items return in later updates?IK: We chose not to implement the mirror for various reasons - for example, we don't want you to accidentally move Haven Station or the Klakar Nest. If we made space stations non-mirrorable like the space hulk was in Weird Worlds, then you'd keep running into situations where you get a sensor blip but can't use the mirror, and that tells you it's a homeworld. If the mirror ever does appear, it will need to have some different kind of behavior. The Mantle would be easy enough to make, but as in Weird Worlds it would end up reducing your score so it's not a great item - also, combat is fun! It would perhaps be more interesting to come up with other ways to befriend specific races.@P: Maybe describe a bit on the use of nebulas &amp; black holes, their role in the design as an obstacle to exploration. (Nebulas usually slow the player down greatly upon entry; Black Holes may be hidden at the start of a map, and force the player to decide to turn back to forge ahead and possibly risk losing immediately.)IK: Since we're dealing with a time limit, adding \"terrain\" forces you to make plans around it and makes the game more interesting, and different each time. We originally had ideas for other kinds of obstacles, like asteroid fields, but just these two made the cut.@P: Events — derelict ship, supernova, Esmeralda, alien rescues. Their appearance, and the timing with which they appear, has the potential to either profoundly change the game, or not really change it much at all, depending on when they turn up, it feels to me like an essential part of the Infinite Space experience. Do you agree?IK: Oh yes, these are a big part of making each game session unique and giving you the sense that almost anything can happen in the Infinite Space universe, from the silly to the spectacular.@P: The Infinite Space games have board and card game versions? What are they like?RC: They're fun. Eat Electric Death! is an old school hex and turn-based tactical starship combat boardgame based on the ships, ship system, items, and the way ships manuever, in the computer game versions. Infinite Space: Explorers is essentially a starship combat card game that uses a \"starmap\" board to keep track of where fleets are, which stars have been explored and where card battles occur. The two Diceland Space sets based in the IS games use James Ernest's unique combat system with giant paper dice. Each die is a starship and you roll them on the table in combat. It's diceless and real time. Nobody makes games like Cheapass Games.@P: How did James Ernst and Cheapass Games help the Strange Adventures series to get started?RC: By generously providing a distribution point for the game. Indie game portals didn't exist then, so it was terrific to have his support. He also got CD's made of the first three or four games. Those are like collector's items now.@P: On mods... Where did you get the idea to make the game moddable? How easy is it, would you say, to make a mod? What are your favorite mods?IK: Rich and I both made mods before we started working in the game industry, so it was natural to us. I also think that the same things that make the game easy to modify, make it easier for us to create the content for it in the first place. There are a lot of cool mods, but the \"Even Stranger\" and \"Even Weirder\" series is a standout favorite for sure. Modding tends to get harder as games get more complex, but we try to make it as easy as possible. In Sea of Stars, we use standard text file format to store all the data in the game so it's possible to get started with just a text editor.@P: Will we see the return of Major Brass?IK: He's the face of the Terran Space Fleet :) Not sure if he's going to make a personal appearance, but anything's possible!RC: New face; same Brass.@P: Who was Phosphorous?IK: Phosphorous, aka. Bill Sears was the third Eel and our main artist for over a decade. He made the splash screen art for half a dozen games, tons of Weird Worlds items and creatures, etc. We had some unforgettable times together, and multiple road trips down to IGF in California. He passed away after a heart attack in 2012. We really miss him.RC: Bill was an amazing friend and contributor. And musician, as we later found out! But not in the traditional sense of guitars and trombones. His music was strange, handmade in his garage and surrealistic. Technically it would be called musique concrete and found sound music. You know how it is. Usually when you hear sound collages that are a bit avant garde, you say no! Turn it off! But it isn't that way at all with Bill's music. It is engrossing like falling into a mind adventure. Very special stuff.@P: Is any of his music in the games? Do you think there might be a place for it, even if just one or two pieces, or are there rights or thematic issues?

      "There’s a lot to be said for bite-size gaming. Huge, epic sagas that last hours on end are all well and good, but now and again it’s nice to dive into a game and climb back out again ten minutes later. Strange Adventures in Infinite Space supplies this hotfooted style of gameplay, granting you the opportunity to whiz around space in ten minutes flat.With randomised worlds and encounters, space isn’t the only thing that is infinite – the replay value is through the roof, as no two voyages will look or feel the same. Strange Adventures can be a little difficult at times and a few extra modes wouldn’t have gone amiss, but this is definitely a journey into the unknown worth taking.The various organisations and governments of planet Hope in the Glory system are at loggerheads with one another, unable to come to an agreement about who should be allowed to explore the surrounding planets and collect the wealth of treasure and resources available. While they’re all arguing, you decide to take all the spoils for yourself, and head out into space.Strange Adventures in Infinite Space throws you right into the action, with simple controls and concepts. Players can click on any planet to travel to it, and once arriving will be given instructions on what to do next, depending on whatever has been discovered. Travelling uses up time, and you must make sure that you return back to planet Hope after roughly ten years, else you’ll owe a conman a lot of money.After landing on a planet, one of the following will occur: You may find ship parts, or a new species to collect, or a treasure to steal, or perhaps a random event will occur. The idea is to grab as much loot as you can for selling back on Hope, boosting your final score to astronomical levels. Allies can also be found and added to your cause.You may bump into alien races too, who are never friendly towards you. If you choose to engage in combat, the view changes to a combat simulator, where you can select your ship and tell it to attack, cloak or flee. Destroying enemies is very rewarding, as you’ll be able to explore the planet they were guarding, but it’s also very risky as the majority of enemies are far more powerful than yourself.This is the concept for Strange Adventures in a nutshell – there are plenty of extra elements to the action depending on which items you find and events that occur, but it doesn’t ever get more complex than this. What makes the game so excitingly playable is the randomness of it all. Every game is completely different, with random planet placement and items to find.Since games only last around ten minutes each, it’s great for playing a quick game or two, but you’ll also be able to completely lose yourself for hours if you so choose. Every trip is saved on a scoreboard along with your name, the name of your ship and what your fate was. Trying to beat your top score with the perfect run through space is very addictive indeed, and the quick nature of play helps to broaden this feeling.While it’s all very entertaining, the enemies are perhaps a little too overpowered. Most of the bad guys you meet will quickly destroy you if you haven’t first found some extra weapons and firepower, and choosing to avoid an enemy can waste oodles of time. It feels a bit like tiptoeing around a minefield, trying not to step on the planets with the lurking nasties.It would also be nice if there were a little more variety where options are concerned. Apart from choosing the size of the solar system and how many enemies are about, there’s not much more to play around with. It would be great if you could alter the amount of time allowed for flying around, or perhaps increase the likelihood of a random event occurring.Strange Adventures in Infinite Space is infinitely playable and we can see ourselves jumping in for a quick once around space for many months to come. The game is completely free to download too, so there really is no excuse not to check this one out.",
      "Cheapass Games is known by board-game aficionados as a publisher of simple, fast, and surprisingly fun games with fairly low production values and very low prices. Strange Adventures in Infinite Space translates almost everything that is fun about this type of gaming to the computer without feeling like a computer port of something you'd have found 20 years ago in Dragon magazine. Paradoxically, the concept and mechanics of Strange Adventures are very similar to those of the old magazine games. The graphics are extremely dated, and the sound is minimal, but the basic idea and implementation are outstanding.The game's concept is simple: You're presented with a playing field of roughly 15 stars. Your task is to explore as many of them as possible in 10 years, bring back as many valuable artifacts and exotic life-forms to your home planet as you can, and defeat as many aliens as possible along the way. Traveling from star to star is measured in days, and passing through nebulae significantly increases your travel time, so you have to plan your travels somewhat. Once you reach an unexplored system, you are presented with an encounter. It can be an alien race, an artifact, a new life-form, or perhaps a friendly starship that will join your flotilla. As you proceed from system to system, you collect your findings and fight (or trade with) aliens in preparation for bringing your booty back to your home system.Your starship has upgradeable components that you can improve as you find new items in your travels. Many of the things you find will be useful to you on board your craft. Early on you have basic weapons, shields, and drives, but after a few chance encounters with some new ships, as well as the acquisition of a new weapon or two, your little armada can become quite formidable. Because this is completely random, you'll find some games where you're completely on your own, and others where you're a miniature fleet admiral. Part of the fun of the game is taking advantage of opportunities to fight when they're presented to you by chance.Starship combat involves a pauseable real-time system that takes weapon ranges, ship speed, and component types into account. There are a number of alien races you can encounter, and there is even a combat simulator in which you can test out various weapons and strategies against different enemies. One of the most amusing episodes we experienced was the sight of a ship being harassed by a single tiny fighter. Because the ship was only armed with slow missiles, it could never get them to hit the fighter, which kept outmaneuvering the attacks. However, the fighter could not inflict enough damage to punch through the larger ship's shields. The result was a standoff that was as whimsical as the game itself.The randomness of the game makes it difficult to plan a strategy, since so much depends on what your encounters present to you. If you're lucky to find an improved interstellar drive early on, you'll likely be able to explore most of the planets and get a high score. However, it's quite possible that at some point on your return journey you'll run into a previously undiscovered black hole and have to choose between turning back and going a different way or proceeding and possibly being blown up. Since the game penalizes you heavily for taking longer than 10 years to carry out your mission, you'll seriously hurt your score if you retreat, so you have little choice but to proceed. These types of random encounters make Strange Adventures seem a bit like an adventure game, where you don't quite know what's going to happen and are in a sense just along for the ride.The game's short length is what makes it so engaging. In a longer game, the random nature of the encounters and lack of player input would become frustrating, but since you can finish a game in five to 15 minutes, you can always just start another one immediately afterward. Strange Adventures is an addictive little game much like Bejeweled or Tetris, but instead of being a puzzle, it's a little adventure that you can lose yourself in for a few minutes at a time. For $15, it's a great buy that will end up being one of those games you keep running in the background and fire up for a while when you need a break. Designers Rich Carlson and Iikka Keranen have managed to capture the feeling of \"what will happen next?\" that marked gameplay in very early computer games, with a style that is attractive today.We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.Use your keyboard!",

      "I stumbled across Strange Adventures in Infinite Space (SAIS) almost by accident last year whilst hunting for a simple distraction that I could reward myself with inbetween bouts of working. I was tired of the tedium of card games and disappointed with every single shoot-em-up I tried for one reason or another.The Digital Eel website promised much from SAIS. It claimed to be original. It claimed to be fun. It claimed to last a mere 10 minutes or so. In short, it couldn’t have sounded more interesting. It was a tiny download, and a painless install.SAIS is essentially a 10-minute exploration of the galaxy, and has a unique blend of boardgame strategy with realtime space dogfights. You’ve got to make it round the galaxy and visit as many planets as possible, plunder them of riches, and defeat any angry aliens that get in the way.Many of the things you pick up are useful equipment and can be bolted on to your ship to help you explore the galaxy more efficiently, or give you a greater edge in combat. Many of the items have hidden or unexpected powers. Much of the fun in the game comes from discovering them and finding out what they do. Sometimes it can take quite some time to figure out what something does.The ultimate aim of the game is to return home before your time is up, and sell your loot to score points and achieve status amongst your peers.Right from the very beginning, SAIS is an aural and visual treat. The 2D graphics have a beautiful, unique style to them, and convey the game to you simply and attractively. It takes all of 2 minutes to forget all the advances in 3D technology and become immersed.The sound effects and little loops are funny, catchy, clever, and cool. Everything that needs a sound has a sound, and they gel together perfectly. In fact this may be one of the few games where I’ve been more impressed by the sound than the graphics.But riding on the audio-visuals is the most addictive game since NetHack.After you’ve played a few times and got the hang of what you’re doing, it is very, very difficult to not just have “one more go”. The trouble is, the games only take a few minutes, so you always figure on having a little bit of time left for another one. My small distraction turned into a big distraction. I suspect I’ve spent more time playing SAIS than I spent playing the original Doom now if I added it all up. This is why SAIS represents such excellent value for money.If SAIS is so addictive because it’s fun and short, the excellent replay value comes because it’s so varied. Every game is random, and every game is completely different. There are only a finite number of things in the game, and not all of them appear in every game, but they can interact in some surprising and usually amusing ways. The clever mix of strategy and realtime dogfighting keeps the action fast-paced and interesting too.And even now, a year after I first played SAIS, I still have the odd go when I’m trying to avoid work.There are now some mods available for free for SAIS which add new artifacts and gameplay and have extended its life even more.Pros:Cons:",

It was created by the independent game development group Digital Eel. In the game players explore a \"plausibly implausible\" (fictional) region of the Milky Way galaxy called The Purple Void.

Stars, black holes, planets, nebulae, artifacts, alien patrols, gadgets, lifeforms and dozens of events and encounters are randomized for each game session.

He also co-founded Digital Eel, an independent video game development group, in 2001. His range of professional skills include illustration, 2D game art, 3D modeling, programming and game design.In his teens, Keränen programmed freeware games for the Commodore Amiga. Later he created the popular Quake mod Airquake, as well as over a hundred free add-on levels for the Doom and Quake series of first-person shooters. He was named the top Doom level maker of all time by Doomworld in 1998, described as \"one of a few pioneer level designers that created the new bottom line for playability and design in Doom levels, as well as helping to develop some of the special FX that many level authors now take for granted\".In recent years he has created 3D architecture, textures and models for many well known computer games including Daikatana, Anachronox, Thief II: The Metal Age, American McGee's Alice and Valve Corporation's Counter-Strike, Half-Life 2, Portal 2, Day of Defeat and Team Fortress 2. In December 2005, Iikka completed \"Argentan\", a map for the multiplayer game Day of Defeat: Source.His Digital Eel credits include design, programming and art. He co-designed all Digital Eel games to date (Plasmaworm, Strange Adventures in Infinite Space, Dr. Blob's Organism, Digital Eel's Big Box of Blox, Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space, Eat Electric Death!, Soup du Jour, Goblin Slayer and Brainpipe) with Rich Carlson.OccupationEngineer",

      "Counter-Strike (also marketed as Half-Life: Counter-Strike) is a multiplayer first-person shooter initially created by Minh Le and Jess Cliffe as a mod for Half-Life. By the fifth beta, Valve Software started actively participating in the development and ultimately bought the rights to the game and offered the original developers jobs at the company which both of them accepted.After about a year in Beta stages, the first full release of the mod was published on November 9, 2000 and the game was also available at retailers in North America shortly thereafter, on November 14, 2000.Since the creation of the franchise, various sequels and spinoffs have been created, such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, and the latest in the series, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.The fast-paced and team-oriented gameplay of Counter-Strike has stayed relatively the same throughout the years. In it, two teams, the Counter-Terrorists and the Terrorists, fight to complete an objective or eliminate the opposing team. Although basic, it is considered one of the most revolutionary online games of all time. The original Counter-Strike came exclusively with multiplayer, without computer-controlled players. Over time, however, several server-side modifications have added bots for in-game use and bots were officially introduced in its later successors, Counter-Strike (Xbox) and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero.Counter-Strike has been praised worldwide for its highly competitive multiplayer. The decision to make the game multiplayer only roots back to its mod origins. Doing a single-player game would have entailed much more work as new models and AI code would have been needed for enemies as opposed to a multiplayer game which requires considerably less work.[2]There are three official scenarios, each with their own teams, objectives, and maps. In all cases, the two teams are the Counter-Terrorists face off against the Terrorists.In the original retail release, a short single-player only training map was included but this was removed when the game was transferred to Steam.There are three official scenarios in Counter-Strike: Assassination, hostage rescue and bomb defusal. A fourth scenario, known as escape, existed during the Counter-Strike Beta. The scenario itself is still playable, but all of the official maps were removed prior to the game's release.In this scenario hostages are being held by the Terrorists. Official maps feature between 3 and 5 hostages, though most maps feature 4 hostages. The Counter-Terrorist team needs to rescue these hostages by escorting them to a hostage rescue zone. The Terrorists must prevent the hostages from being rescued. Victory can also be attained by eliminating the opposing team.This scenario features two bombsites and one Terrorist starts off with a C4. The bomb must be planted at either bombsite. After the bomb has been planted, it will explode after a certain amount of time. During this time, Counter-Terrorists may attempt to defuse the bomb and successful defusal will make the Counter-Terrorists victorious. If the bomb explodes, the Terrorists will win the round. It is also possible to win a round by eliminating the opposing team.This scenario is the least popular of the three and only a single map, Oilrig, is featured in the latest release of the game. In this scenario a single player on the Counter-Terrorist team takes the role of a VIP that must make it to a VIP escape zone. Some maps feature only one escape zone while others feature multiple escape zones. The Terrorists have to take out the VIP and successfully eliminating the VIP will yield victory to the Terrorists. Both teams have a restricted arsenal of weapons available for purchase. Like in other scenarios, victory can also be attained by eliminating the opposing team.Counter-Strike features a large variety of maps that take place in different environments including urban, arctic, jungle and desert settings. During the post-beta stages, maps were still rotated in the official distribution on a slightly smaller scale. Since the release of Counter-Strike 1.6, no maps have been added or removed from the game.It should be noted that the majority of maps for the game were created by people that were originally simply hobbyist mappers. When Valve Software later bought the rights to Counter-Strike and its content these became the first works published at retail for many of the level designers.[3]There are 25 official maps in the latest version of Counter-Strike.*This map was exclusive to the mod edition of the game.Counter-Strike features a variety of weapons, ranging from knives to shotguns and submachine guns. The weapons for Counter-Strike were chosen mainly based on two criteria. For one, the weapons had to be satisfying to use and they had to look and sound cool. The other criteria was realism and what weapons the factions would likely be using in real-life. The former of these criteria was given more weight than ensuring authenticity.[4]Inspiration for potential weapon candidates were taken from various movies.[5] For example, the movie Ronin inspired the inclusion of the Krieg 552 and M249.[6] Further inspiration was also taken from the movies Air Force One and the Professional.[5]Most of the information regarding the weapons themselves was sourced from the internet or from gun magazines.[7] Because limited information was available regarding some of the weapons, Minh Le had to guess how some weapons could have functioned when animating them and thus a few weapon models exhibit differences when compared to their real-world counterparts.[8]Counter-Strike notably features left-handed weapon view models. These models were made as left-handed because the creator of these models and the main man behind Counter-Strike, Minh Le, is left-handed and thus preferred animating the weapons from that side.[9] The game features a possibility of changing the models to right-handed, but as the models are simply mirrored from their left-handed counterparts they sport some inaccuracies when compared to their real-world counterparts.Counter-Strike features a total of 25 weapons, some of which are exclusive to the Counter-Terrorists and others which are exclusive to the Terrorists. The list also indicates the original name of a weapon from the mod release if applicable.Along with the weapons, there are nine pieces of acquirable equipment, three of which are grenades. If ammunition, the radio and the flashlight are to be included, the number of equipment is increased to twelve.Counter-Strike features a number of different factions that are aligned either with the Counter-Terrorists or the Terrorists. The only difference between factions of the same side is the player model that will be visible to other players. Thus for example on snow themed maps, players may favor picking the Arctic Avengers when playing as Terrorists due to their white camouflage.Player models for the Counter-Strike Beta had been created by Minh Le, however for the full release Valve Software stepped in to provide new player models because the old models were inefficient in terms of polygon count and texture sizes.[10] These models were created by Chuck Jones and Stephen Theodore.[11][12] In Counter-Strike 1.1 these models were enhanced with higher resolution textures and the C4 and the defusal kit were re-added to the player models.With the release of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero 1.1 on April 28, 2004 it became possible for owners of Condition Zero to use the enhanced player models in this game. Previously, there used to be no direct way of disabling these upgraded models.[13] In the update issued on February 2, 2013 it was finally made possible to toggle these models at will via an Enable HD models if available checkbox.[14] Ticking this checkbox will also replace all models used from the original Half-Life, including the scientist model sometimes used for hostages, with their HD counterparts.Each team has four available factions that players can choose as their third-person model.The game started out as a Half-Life modification on the GoldSrc engine. It went through numerous iterations and it grew in popularity to become one of the most popular first-person shooters of all time. During the fifth beta Valve Software decided to get involved and eventually purchased the rights to the game.On August 31, 2000 it was announced that Counter-Strike would be released as a retail product in addition to also being available as a mod for Half-Life.[15] The decision to turn the game into a retail product was made as it was felt that a retail release would make the game more accessible.[16] Valve Software also wanted to see how the market would react to a multiplayer product that didn't require Half-Life.[16]With the impending retail release, various legal issues had to be sorted out. One of these issues was the weapon names. They were changed to bogus names in order to avoid legal issues.[17] In addition to simply purchasing the rights to the game, Valve Software also had to approach each level designer and artist to secure the rights to the maps and textures. Some textures were found to have dubious origins and they had to be remade or censored, which lead to some changes in maps for the retail release.[18][19] While Minh Le had hoped that all maps would have been made part of the retail release,[20] Valve opted to only include some of the maps in the retail release. For the maps that weren't purchased by Valve, Minh Le decided to reimburse the authors out of his own pockets despite him having no obligation to do so.[18]Naturally, the new version of the game would also feature new content. Three new weapons were modeled for the release by Minh Le. Also, all new player models were provided by Valve Software.[10] Maverick Developments was also contracted to produce a training map for the retail version of the game.[21]In October it was stated that the mod version of the game would be released as soon as the retail version had gone gold.[22] On November 9, 2000 it was announced that the retail release had gone gold, thus the mod version was released.[23] The retail version appeared on store shelves in North America on November 14, 2000.[24]Much like during the beta stages, various patches were released for the game after its full release. Since Valve was now involved, updates that needed substantial changes to the engine were also possible. This included the introduction of a brand new spectator mode in Counter-Strike 1.1, voice-over communications in Counter-Strike 1.3 and anti-cheating technology in Counter-Strike 1.4. On June 12, 2002 Counter-Strike 1.5 was released which was the final version of the game available as a separately downloadable patch before the game was transferred to Steam.Counter-Strike had already made an appearance on Steam during early closed beta testing of both Counter-Strike 1.4 and the content delivery platform in early 2002.[25] In March 2002, this beta testing was also opened to the public.[26] However the use of Steam at this point was strictly for beta testing purposes and there were no plans to make the actual game available via Steam yet.[27] Valve had wanted to make the game available on Steam coinciding with the release of Counter-Strike 1.5, but they eventually fell behind schedule and the transfer to Steam had to wait until Counter-Strike 1.6.[28]In October 2002 the news were dropped that Counter-Strike 1.6 would initially be made available via Steam and that a beta test would precede the actual release.[29] Public beta testing was initially to commence in mid-November,[30] but the date was first pushed back to mid-December[31] until testing finally commenced on January 16, 2003.[32] However, due to overwhelming demand further beta admissions were quickly suspended since the Steam servers ran out of bandwidth.[33] Steam and thus the Counter-Strike 1.6 beta was made publicly available again on February 11, 2003.[34]The game would be updated numerous times during this beta test and Counter-Strike 1.6 saw the inclusion of new weapons and a completely new interface based on the VGUI2 technology by Valve Software. The official bot that was being developed by Turtle Rock Studios for Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was also beta tested by the public in Counter-Strike 1.6 between June 5, 2003[35] and September 9, 2003[36].[37] After over half a year of public beta testing, beta testing concluded on September 9, 2003.[38] The final release of Counter-Strike 1.6 was initially supposed to be released the very next day,[38] however last minute changes to the Steam network took longer than expected and the final version of Counter-Strike 1.6 was released on September 12, 2003 together with the Steam client.[39][40][41]Counter-Strike 1.6 ended up being the last major content update for the game and the version number is now commonly used as a title to differentiate the original game from the rest of the series. Since the release of Steam, various smaller patches have been released which have introduced fixes to bugs/exploits or smaller balance changes. A Counter-Strike 1.7 was planned for merging the online communities of Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Condition Zero,[42] but such an update was never released.In 2007 an update was introduced that caused quite a lot of controversy even before its introduction: in-game advertisements.[43] Despite the negative reaction by the community,[44] these advertisements would go on to decorate parts of the interface and the walls of some maps for a period of six years before they were eventually removed in 2013 when Counter-Strike was transferred over to the SteamPipe content delivery system.On January 29, 2013 a beta of the game was made available for Linux and Mac OS X and on February 14, 2013 support for these platforms was officially released.[45][46]The sound effects for the game were primarily the responsibility of Jess Cliffe.[47] Sounds for the Radio Commands and the Announcer were in fact recorded by him.[48]Some sound effects were also done by other people.[8] For example, the sound effects for the M249 were contributed by an actual employee of Fabrique Nationale, the manufacturer of the weapon.[49]An advertising campaign was also launched by the publisher, Sierra Entertainment, in late 2000. This campaign saw advertisements for the game appearing in various gaming publications including Computer Gaming World and PC Gamer.[51][52] Sierra also launched their official website for the game on November 4, 2000.[53]Perhaps in an effort to increase the value of the original retail edition, other Half-Life mods were included in the package. These were Half-Life Deathmatch, Half-Life: Opposing Force Capture the Flag, FireArms, Redemption, Wanted! and Team Fortress Classic. All of these mods included only the multiplayer component.The official strategy guide for the game was published by Versus Books.[54] Other than including regular gameplay hints, it also includes 2D overviews of the retail version maps.[55] At the time of publishing this was quite useful since overviews weren't made part of the game until Counter-Strike 1.3.When Counter-Strike left beta stages and the first complete build was released, two different editions of the game were available: mod and retail. After the game was transferred over to Steam, both of these editions were discontinued and only the Steam version is still supported. Since the release of the Steam version, the legacy editions (mod and retail) have been retroactively referred to as the the WON version based on the name of the matchmaking service used by those editions.This was essentially the edition that was the most direct continuation of the beta releases. The mod edition of the game could be downloaded from the official Counter-Strike web site and required Half-Life to be installed in order to be playable.Because this distribution was a mod just like the previous beta releases, this edition of the game kept the real weapon names. Also, this edition had exclusive maps that were not included in the retail edition as Valve Software had not bought the rights to all maps.[56] The exclusive maps were Arabstreets, Dust2, Estate, Foption, Highrise, Inferno, Nuke, Rotterdam, Tundra, Vegas and Vertigo. Some of these maps were removed/introduced in subsequent patches.When Counter-Strike was transferred to Steam with version 1.6, this edition was discontinued.This edition was the first standalone release of Counter-Strike and Half-Life was not required to play the game. Since this edition of the game was like any other regular retail game release, Valve Software had to alter the weapon names and used made up names to prevent having to face legal issues.[17] On a more curious note, the names of two Terrorist factions were also slightly altered for this edition. It is not known why this change was made or why it was exclusive to this edition of the game.Valve Software had only bought the rights to some of the maps that were part of Counter-Strike, thus this release included fewer maps than the mod edition of the game.[56] Separate map packs were released via the official web site that added the missing maps to this edition.[57] However, the training map was exclusive to this edition of the game.[58]Older retail releases including the original Half-Life: Counter-Strike, Half-Life: Generation and Half-Life: Platinum Collection include this edition of the game.When Counter-Strike was transferred to Steam with version 1.6, this edition was discontinued.This edition of the game was based on the retail edition meaning that it uses made-up weapon names and the slightly altered Terrorist faction names. Compared to the retail edition many of the missing maps were added. The added maps were Dust2, Estate, Inferno, Nuke and Vertigo. Curiously the training map was removed.Newer retail releases including Counter-Strike 1 Anthology include this edition of the game.This is the only edition that is still supported and is still occasionally being updated. Owners of the retail edition or the original Half-Life retail release can migrate to this edition by activating the CD key on Steam.Counter-Strike has received generally favorable reviews, scoring an average of 88/100 and 89/100 on the aggregator sites Metacritic and GameRankings respectively.[59][60]Reviewers praised the teamplay and social aspects of the game. Scott Osbourne of GameSpot thought the round based gameplay allowed chatting dead players forming a sense of tension.[62] Clayton Wolfe of IGN thought that successful teamplay was the recipe for ensuring a victory for ones team.[63] At Computer Games Magazine, Bill Hiles stated that \"teamwork is crucial for success\" and noted that better players utilized coordinated team efforts to succeed in the game.[61]The choice of weapons was praised by Osbourne, with him stating that \"one of Counter-Strike's biggest appeals has always been the selection of weapons\".[62] Dan Watson of PC Gameworld thought the weapon modeling was excellent and that they handled realistically.[64]While Wolfe felt that the weapon purchasing system was frustrating at first, it quickly stated feeling like an enhancement to the online experience.[63] Watson thought the purchasing system brought a great deal of variety to the game, stating that \"one round may find you perched on a fire escape with a high-caliber sniper rifle, while on the next round you may choose to bust in the front door with a double-barreled shotgun\".[64]Journalists were torn on the graphical side of the game. Osbourne stated that \"the Half-Life graphics engine may be dated now, but Counter-Strike has always used it to its fullest potential\" and thought the new player model graphics were especially good.[62] Wolfe stated that \"visually the game will not disappoint\" even though the Half-Life engine was dated and thought the environmental textures looked \"realistic enough\".[63] Watson however thought the game had a noticeably dated look, stating that \"no amount of tweaking can disguise the fact that this engine is based on a two-year-old core, and a facelift would really work wonders\".[64]The weapon sound effects were well received by Osbourne, Wolfe and Watson. Scott Osbourne thought \"the guns sound remarkably realistic and powerful, which makes them viscerally fun to shoot\".[62] IGN editor Wolfe concluded that \"the realistic guns sounds are spot on\".[63] Watson thought the sound effects in overall were on par or superior to other games on the market.[64] However, Wolfe thought that the other sound effects used sounded wimpy and he had hoped for deeper bass and clearer sounds.[63]Generally, reviewer concluded that the retail release was a good buy for people who didn't own Half-Life or didn't have access to high-speed internet connections.[61][62][63] It was also seen as a good release from the point of convenience as everything needed to play the game online was available on a single CD.[61]As of December 3, 2008, Counter-Strike has sold over 4.2 million retail copies, more than any other Valve game besides Half-Life and its sequel, Half-Life 2.[65] Since Counter-Strike is also available as a modification for Half-Life, part of the Half-Life sales are commonly attributed to the success of Counter-Strike.[66] In fact, the sales of Half-Life increased year-on-year for a few years after its release which was very unusual at the time as most games had a shelf life of around 3 months. Gabe Newell attributed this pattern to the popularity of Counter-Strike and thought the release of the mod was the best thing that could have happened to Half-Life.[67]After its release, the game topped many lists as the most popular online game.[68][69] Even in 2015, 15 years after the release of the game, the game frequented the top 25 games played on Steam list and its longevity has outlasted both Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and Counter-Strike: Source.[70][71]Counter-Strike has won various awards. It won the Game Developers Conference Game Spotlight award in 2001.[72] The game was also granted the Game of the Year 2000 title by Gamers.com while Voodoo Extreme gave it the readers choice award.[73] Computer Games Magazine, Game Revolution, Electronic Playground and GameSpot (UK and US) all granted it the award of best online/multiplayer game of 2000.[73]Counter-Strike is considered one of the most influential multiplayer games of all time.[74] The game is also attributed to having pushed the competitive gaming movement forward.[75] It has also been reported that Counter-Strike was the first game for which a fantasy league was started.[76]Developer(s)Valve CorporationPublisher(s)Valve CorporationSierra EntertainmentPlatform(s)Microsoft WindowsMac OS XLinuxRelease date(s)June

      "Canals (de_canals) is a bomb defusal map featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.On March 15, 2017 Canals was added to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, along with the Spectrum Case and new models for the Phoenix Connexion terrorists.The map recreates the general area around Piazza San Marco (also known as the St. Mark's Square) in Venice. Recreated landmarks include Doge's Palace (Palazzo Ducale), Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri), St Mark's Basilica, St Mark's Campanile, St Mark's Clocktower, and the Columns of San Marco and San Todaro. [1]The base of St Mark's Campanile serves as Bombsite A, while Bridge of Sighs serves as Bombsite B.Canals is based on real-world environments and the idea for the map Canals originally came to Iikka Keränen after visiting Venice.[2][3] Originally, the map was called de_venice but despite the shared name, it was not related to the earlier cancelled Venice map by Ido Magal.[2] The aesthetics were intentionally given a clean and uncluttered look despite the real-world influence to enhance player visibility.[3]Creator(s)Iikka KeränenGame(s)ScenarioBomb DefusalMap GroupDefusal Group SigmaTerroristsPhoenix ConnexionCounter-TerroristsSEAL Team 6First appearanceCounter-Strike: Global OffensiveLast appearanceCounter-Strike: Global OffensiveThis article/section is under construction.While this article/section is still under construction.

      "The Top 100 WADs Of All Time: 1996\n\n1996 brought Quake and the beginning of the long exodus of mapmakers away from Doom to more modern engines.  Nevertheless, the releases this year are plentiful, as the Quake editing scene was still in its infancy and people were still shaking Doom out of their systems.  Visual styles continued to evolve, with architecture growing more complex and new textures becoming commonplace.\n\n\n\nMemento Mori - Many\nCompared to the speed of most Doom projects these days, it's hard to believe that Memento Mori was able to gather 21 level designers and texture artists, produce 32 good levels, along with a consistent theme with a liberal dose of custom graphics, all not much over 5 months.  The gameplay of most of the levels can't be faulted. The interesting layouts of the levels, and excellent placement of monsters and traps, means that there's never a dull moment. There are also plenty of good quality secrets throughout. Unusually, Memento Mori was also designed specifically with cooperative play in mind, and it plays excellently in this mode.

(cph)\n\nMemento Mori 2 - Various\nMemento Mori 2 is a continuation of the WADmaking enterprise of the original Memento Mori, where many level authors worldwide came together in an effort to make a good megawad, fast.  Released only seven months after the first, Memento Mori 2 is another collection of fantastic levels of all themes and difficulties, and is in fact even better than the first, as might be expected given the authors' extra experience.  Since the WAD is a communal effort, there is no real common thread running through the levels: one might be a gothic cavern while the next is a brushed-metal space station.  Regardless, it's very well done and is certainly one of the best megawads ever created.  (Ling)\n\nDystopia 3  - Anthony Czerwonka and Iikka Ker�nen\nIikka and Adel are about as close to legends as Doom has had (outside Romero and Carmack anyway) and this is possibly their finest collaboration.  Dyst3 features a multitude of doom2.exe special effects, many created by these two, such as 3d bridges, instant move sectors and more.  Each map is excellently detailed and features some top notch gameplay and for a wad from 1996 it looks great.  It also has a self-contained story (as much as possible with the Doom engine) with pretty convincing vehicles showing how you got to each map (usually via a crash), and ends off with you blowing up Microsoft.  Yes, you read that right.  (Cyb)\n\nAll Hell is Breaking Loose - Joel Huenink\nAll Hell is Breaking Loose certainly lives up to its name.  While the maps aren't great and the new graphics are a bit rough around the edges, this wad does have a few things going for it.  First off it's just all around crazy.  You'll face off against ressurected imps, flaming demons, two-headed chaingunners, gigantic cyberdemons, insane plasma troopers, helicoptors, and flying monsters that give you the finger and yell \"fuck you\" when you kill them.  Pure insanity.  On top of that All Hell is one of the first mapsets to feature a nice amount of dehacked work, with the crown going to arachnotrons with two-headed chaingunners riding on top of them.  When you kill the arachnotron the chaingunner drops off his fallen chariot and fills you full of lead.  If you're looking for a little insanity in the midst of all those 'serious' Doom maps, look no further than this. (Cyb)\n\nAOD-DOOM - Various\nIn the grand tradition of making Doom into stuff not originally intended comes Army of Darkness Doom.  Based on the cult classic movie of the same name (part three of the Evil Dead trilogy), AOD Doom puts you in the boots of Ash, the loveable hero, and dedicated S-Mart employee of the AOD movie.  The maps, while nothing great by today's standards (which is often the case with old maps anyway) are still quite nice, and all of them present a pretty good challenge.  You'll also notice some familiar situations such as your meeting with Evil Ash, the pit, the windmill (complete with moving blades) and even S-Mart makes an appearance.  While the graphics may not all be great (most are borrowed from Hexen) the TC is a good deal of fun, and a must have any for AOD fans (which are probably also the majority of Doom fans) out there. (Cyb)\n\nIcarus - TeamTNT\n Icarus is TeamTNT's second megawad after Evilution, their commercialized freshman effort that became half of Final Doom.  However, due to the vagaries of the publishing world, Icarus was actually the first to be released to the general public.  The megawad follows the space marine as a member of the Earth Defense Force, alternating between high-tech brushed-metal spaceships and more earthy alien worlds, with a series of teleports on each level connecting them together thematically.  The gameplay is nice, but sadly the looks have suffered more than other megawads from the era.  Nonetheless there's lots of nice tricks and traps for anyone who's followed TeamTNT through the years. (Ling)\n\nPolygon Base - Rick Lipsey\nPolygon Base was mostly overlooked at the time of its release, only to be highlighted a few years later by RicrobNet, one of our hosted WAD-review sites.  The level is large and complex, but the shining feature is its extreme nonlinearity: you need all three keys to exit, but besides that, you can go wherever you want and in any order.  The author, Rick Lipsey, shines at making the level look good by using \"clean\" textures to go with the sparse architecture.  Compared to the FPS levels of today where every room has exactly one entrance and one exit, and Polygon Base looks positively sprawling.  (Ling)\n\n99 Ways to Die - Warren Marshall\n The year?  1996.  The game?  Quake.  The topic?  Lights.  Doom's successor was fast approaching and its new realistic lighting model was causing unrest among level authors eager to break out of the sector-based restraints which made lighting Doom levels a banal affair.  Enter Warren Marshall, whose 99 Ways to Die, more than anything, raised the bar for lighting effects in Doom.  Faked lightsourcing had been done before, of course, but Marshall's levelset takes it to a new level, casting light and shadow in a quasi-realistic way to keep the Quake-engine wolves at bay a little longer.  (Ling)\n\nTrooper's Playground - Matthias Worch\nThe Trooper's Playground is another example of mapmaking circa 1996: the style is still evolving, but level authors have become very creative in their tricks and traps.  Created by Matthias Worch, the levelset features lots of crushing ceilings, trap doors, moving walls, and so on in a great example of the lengths mappers would go to in order to trick the increasingly savvy player.  Nowadays the MacGyver-esque practice of creating elaborate traps from the sparse collection of linedef tags has mostly gone by the wayside as ports like ZDoom make it possible to script almost any scenario one could imagine, but I fondly remember attempting to dream up new ways to use the stock Doom effects to trap an unwitting player.  This WAD shows what a clever author could come up with.  (Ling)\n\nHidden Mountain Factory - Grzegorz Werner\nI'm not sure why I never hear about this map (I only found it while scouring the idgames archive), but here's your obscure 1996 wad.  Hidden Mountain Factory takes place just there, and quite convincingly.  The map has all sorts of machinery and pits and vats of slime (like any good factory should) and features some rather intense battles due to the close quarters of nearly the entire map.  The difficulty on UV is a bit higher because of this, plus the large amount of monsters in a fairly short map (you should be able to finish it in 8 mins) will keep you busy the entire time.  Great looking map as well, especially considering it was made over seven years ago.  If you haven't played this yet (which is highly likely), I recommend you give it a go.

      "Spelunky is an open source indie platform video game created by Derek Yu and released as freeware for Microsoft Windows. It was remade for the Xbox 360 in 2012, with ports to the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and then back to Microsoft Windows. The player controls a spelunker who explores a series of caves while collecting treasure, saving damsels, fighting enemies and dodging traps. The caves are procedurally generated, making each run through the game unique. Spelunky is one of the first examples of a roguelike-like, borrowing concepts from the roguelike genre, and was the influence for many later roguelike-like games.The first public release was on December 21, 2008. The source code of the 2008 Windows version was released on December 25, 2009. An enhanced version for Xbox Live Arcade was released on July 4, 2012. The enhanced edition was also released on PC on August 8, 2013 and for PlayStation 3 on August 27 and 28, 2013 and for PlayStation 4 on October 7, 2014. A Chrome OS version of the original game was made as well, titled Spelunky HTML5. A sequel, Spelunky 2, is set to be released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe player controls an unnamed adventurer, known as the spelunker. The aim of the game is to explore underground tunnels, gathering as much treasure as possible while avoiding traps and enemies. The spelunker can whip or jump on enemies to defeat them, pick up items that can be thrown to either attack enemies or set off traps, and use a limited supply of bombs and ropes to navigate the caves. Levels are randomly generated and grouped into four increasingly difficult \"areas\", each with a distinctive set of items, enemies, terrain types and special features. Later areas contain more valuable treasures, secret locations, and items. If the player loses all their hearts or runs into an instant-kill trap, they will have to start from the beginning.\nEnemies include animals like bats, snakes and spiders of varying sizes, other characters, and monsters like yeti, man-eating plants and ghosts. The player can collect many items, mainly gold and jewels which add to the player's score, but also useful objects including bombs, guns, climbing gear and archaeological artifacts. Some of the latter have supernatural abilities, including kapalas, hedjets, crystal skulls and golden ankhs, though many of these special items can only be gained through secret methods, like combining other items together. Some items may be purchased or stolen from shops scattered about the caves, though the shopkeepers become powerful enemies if you steal from them.\nThe player can also encounter damsels in distress trapped in the caves, who can be picked up and carried to an exit. Successfully doing so returns health to the player. It's possible to unlock the damsel as a playable character; gameplay is identical, except that the player encounters spelunkers to rescue. Another unlockable character is the \"Tunnel Man\", who possesses a mattock instead of a whip.\nThe Xbox Live Arcade, as well as the PlayStation Network versions of the game feature local multiplayer (co-op and deathmatch) for up to four players. There are 9 different characters to play as.\nThe original Spelunky also includes a level editor, in which players can create their own non-random levels to share with others.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nSpelunky was created by Derek Yu and released as freeware for Microsoft Windows on December 21, 2008. The source code of the 2008 Windows version was published under a software license permitting noncommercial distribution and modification on December 25, 2009. Based on this source code the game community created a community patch which added support for Mac OS X. Since the game source code became available community members have created many modified versions, or mods, of the original game. Most of these are available via the forums on the website for Derek Yu's video game company, Mossmouth, where a list is maintained of finished mods.\nAn enhanced remake version for Xbox Live Arcade was released on July 4, 2012. The enhanced edition was also released on PC on August 8, 2013 and for PlayStation 3 on August 27 and 28, 2013.\n\n\n=== Influences ===\nSpelunky draws from La-Mulana, Rick Dangerous, and Spelunker for its visual styling, character design, gameplay elements and general mechanics. Essentially a dungeon crawl, it also adds elements from the roguelike genre, including randomly generated levels, a lack of save points, frequent and easy death, and discovery mechanics. It draws equally from the 2D platformer genre, including real-time interactions with enemies. According to Yu, the Super Mario series of video games was one of the game's biggest inspirations, especially in \"feel and physics.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIGN gave the XBLA version a score of 9.0 and an Editor's Choice award, calling it \"a superb 2D platformer that's as easy to hate as it is to love.\" GamesRadar gave the game 5/5, praising its gameplay and constant sense of discovery. GameTrailers gave the game a score of 8.3, praising its design but criticising some control quirks and throwaway multiplayer. 1UP.com gave the game an A ranking, saying \"it offers the same immediate, pick-up-and-play fun of Geometry Wars, but demands much more than the simple reflexive reactions of your lizard brain.\"PC Gamer UK chose the remake of Spelunky as its 2013 game of the year. Eurogamer ranked Spelunky third on its Games of the Generation list. In 2015, Rock, Paper, Shotgun ranked the original Spelunky 1st on its The 50 Best Free Games On PC list. A difficult challenge run of Spelunky HD, known as an \"eggplant run\", was reported on by various video game news websites.\nThe spelunker, the main character of Spelunky, is one of several indie game characters who can be unlocked and played in Super Meat Boy. Referred to as \"Spelunky\" in Super Meat Boy, the character has the special power of explosive jumps (referencing the bombs he carries in the original game), and he is exclusive to the Xbox Live Arcade version. He also makes an appearance in Bit.Trip Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien as a DLC character.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\"Spelunky\". The A.V. Club. 2009-02-02. \n\"Infinite Lives: Neo-nostalgia\". Vue Weekly. 2009-01-29. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of open source games\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

      "“The creative mind mind is like a big pile of jigsaw puzzle pieces. Some pieces were made by other people–inspirational words of advice, an intriguing screenshot from a game you’ve never heard of, a haunting melody–and some are gained through life experiences. Some pieces are already connected either because they came that way or because while you were walking down the street or taking a shower they somehow found each other. Sometimes a single piece is missing, and once that piece is uncovered, two other pieces from other ends of the pile can finally be connected.”The most recent edition to the Boss Fight Books catalog is “Spelunky” by Derek Yu. Interestingly, this is the first Boss Fight book written by the developer of the game being written about. Not only did Yu (along with Andy Hull) help create Spelunky (the game), Yu wrote a book about his experience when he was creating the game.As one would expect from a book written by a creator of a game about that game, much of “Spelunky” discusses Yu’s experience of how Spelunky was created. Yu talks about his childhood exposure to video games such as the original Legend of Zelda, to how the concept of a roguelike platform came to fruition, and the experience of working on Spelunky with Hull. This books is important to anyone and everyone who cares about video games. If you’re a distinguished developer, you should read this book. If you’re an aspiring game maker, you should read this book. If you play video games and care enough to learn about them, you should read this book.“Spelunky” has so many unique facets that even if I could discuss them in a review, I don’t think I would want to as to not spoil the book. Yu’s writing is so charming and light-hearted that after reading his book you’d already feel like he was one of your good friends. Moreover, regardless of your opinion of the game, it’s hard not to sympathize with Yu and Hull when they were creating Spelunky. If you enjoyed Indie Game: The Movie you would really enjoy this book, as both have a similar flavor: indie developers who try to inflict their mark on the world with their creative vision face countless obstacles when creating their games. If you care about the development histories behind various indie games composed of only a few people, “Spelunky” is one hell of a good book.If you’re not a game developer, but really enjoy video games, I would still recommend “Spelunky.” Reading a book on how games are created makes you appreciate video games in a new light based on the technological and developmental difficulties developers faced when creating games. You think less like “This level is dumb because it’s hard” and more “I see why they made this level difficult because…” So even if you’re not a developer, but really enjoy video games, give “Spelunky” a read–it’ll definitely alter how you look at video games.I’ve read most of the Boss Fight Books catalog, and this would have to be in my top 3 of their books (I also heavily recommend “Bible Adventures” by Gabe Durham). Seriously, these books are so damn good.

      "Okay, for those not in the know: what the hell is Spelunky?Spelunky is a platformer where every level is randomly-generated. So each time you play you get a new layout and a new adventure. The game was inspired by roguelike games, which are meant to be played many times. As such, there's a lot to discover and many ways to interact with your environment. You start with a supply of bombs, so you can even blow up the terrain.The goal is to find the ultimate treasure at the bottom of the caves and end the game with as much money as possible so you can brag to your friends or make new ones, even!And the game' s been available for free online for a while, hasn't it...Yeah! I released the freeware version in 2008, just for fun. From there it took off!What was the decision behind bringing it to XBLA now?Jonathan Blow, the creator of Braid, became a fan of the game and suggested that I put it on XBLA. He even put me in touch with Microsoft so I could pitch the idea to them. That guy's been really generous with his time... you can tell he's very invested in supporting indie games and generally making the world a better place, which is super-cool.I'll do my best to pay it forward.And what sort of tweaks and changes are you making to it?The upgrade to the graphics and music are the most obvious change, but we're also putting a lot of effort into smoothing out the controls and interface. I want to make the game really polished so that people can get to exploring the game as quickly as possible. And speaking of exploring... we'll definitely be adding new EVERYTHING to the caves, including monsters, traps, and level types. There will be plenty of stuff in there that veterans of the original Spelunky have never seen.Is there anything new you can tell us/show us of the game's XBLA version?Sure, here's a new screenshot from the game, showcasing the jetpack and shotgun you'll use.How many of you are on the creative team?Right now it's three of us. Me, my friend Andy Hull, who's doing design and coding, and Eirik \"Phlogiston\" Surhke, who's working on music. Andy is a former toy designer who I've known for over 10 years, when we met in the Klik n' Play community. Eirik has composed music for a lot of indie games, and runs Pause Music, a label for indie music and chiptunes.How did this all start originally? What was the original thinking behind Spelunky?I had just finished Aquaria with my buddy Alec Holowka and I wanted to make a little freeware game to relax. I made a few prototypes for platformers and roguelikes before I realized it might be a good idea to combine ideas from both genres and make a platform game that could be played hundreds or thousands of times without getting bored. What really tied the idea together, though, was the bombs and ropes - with these tools the player wouldn't be constrained to a single path. It made level generation a lot easier because I wouldn't have to worry about players getting stuck as much, and could add areas that were completely closed off.And what' s your background in the game development field?I started out in the Klik community, making games with Clickteam's Klik n' Play and Multimedia Fusion programs. The way I make games now is not so different from when I was a kid, actually. The only differences are that the tools have gotten better, the communities have gotten bigger, and there are more channels to get your games out to people. It's amazing to me that you can release a freeware game today and there's a chance it will become an XBLA title!It's received a lot of praise from all quarters - Team Meat seem to love the game. How's that feel?It feels great! Especially because it was so unexpected. You always hope that people will enjoy the same things you do, but it's hard to know. As a developer you always brace yourself for disappointment, so when people you really respect tell you you did something good, it gives you a lot of validation.Even criticism is great - it shows you that people care enough about your work to write something. I try to remember that when I'm online and give people good feedback whenever I can.How do you design a game where the dungeons/cave combinations are unlimited?You just have to add enough elements to the game that can be changed each time you play! In Spelunky, not only are the cave layouts randomized, but the placement of monsters, traps, treasure, and items are randomized. But just having a large number of combinations is not enough - you want the levels to feel \"purposeful\". The more it feels like a hand-created level, the better.Thoughts on a PSN/Wii/3DS version?I probably won't be releasing the game for PSN or Wii any time soon. A handheld version of the game would be cool, but I'm more interested in releasing a PC version first. Even though I'm really excited to be working on my first console game, I love PC gaming and am very grateful to the fans of the original game. In a just world they'd get to play the new game on PC at some point (no promises about when that will be).What' s next for you?Finish the game! But beyond Spelunky, I'd like to return to making new freeware, which is the most fun for me. It's also the best place to test out my new ideas. And I need to get back into traditional art, like drawing and painting. I'm getting too comfortable with Photoshop!What, to you, are the foundations that make the ultimate 2D game?Cool game world and characters, well-balanced challenge, and lots of variety. Oh, and great art and music!What titles are you most hyped for this year?I'm pretty hyped for Fez, which is coming out for XBLA. And I'll be very interested to see where Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft will be in a year. Both those games are already available to play, but are also in constant development.As far as mainstream games go, all my hyped games are sequels: Duke Nukem Forever, Mortal Kombat, Marvel vs. Capcom 3, and Diablo 3. I actually don't mind playing sequels at all. Part of it is the nostalgia-factor, of course, but it's also fun to see how a series evolves over the years. Video game development is a highly iterative process.Any recommendations for free online titles (aside from your own) that we should play?I already mentioned Dwarf Fortress. It's the most complex simulation I've ever played, and it's incredibly interesting just to read about. The stories that come out of playing the game rival most pre-scripted fantasy narratives, in my opinion.If you like classic horizontal shoot 'em ups, try out Hydorah - it's a real labor of love. If you want to play a great puzzle game, play Desktop Dungeons - it's got randomly-generated levels like Spelunky and it's great fun.Finally, if you're looking for something a bit different and you're a fan of the surreal, try the RPG Space Funeral. There are a lot of great freeware games out there!",
      "SourcePCG: There’s a section in the book called ‘feedback loop’ where you write that Spelunky was a small idea that quickly grew organically. That seems like an ideal situation for a creative person. Is that a hard phenomenon to trigger? Do you work for it, or does it arrive in a fit of inspiration?DY: You definitely have to put in the work. Start with small ideas and try making them. What I found is that I’d often hit a wall, so I’d go back and think about what I’m going to do again, find a new idea, mix and match some existing ideas I’ve already had and go back at it. You hit a wall, and then you hit another, and eventually you get to an idea where everything seems to fit and you just start flying.That’s kinda how it was with Spelunky: I had all these prototypes before Spelunky, and they were all really exciting at the start but pretty soon you hit a wall. Once I started working on Spelunky I never hit the wall, I just kept going and going, and there kept being more interesting avenues to explore with it. I don’t think I would have just come across it without working on the previous prototypes, which meant sitting down and making games. I definitely advocate actually making games, getting your hands dirty, because that’s the only way to really figure out what sticks. There are so many ideas that sound good in your head, but when you start working on them they aren’t [that good].PCG: Spelunky’s Deathmatch mode is one of my favourite competitive games. You write in the book that you were surprised people didn’t pick it up more. Why do you think they didn’t?DY: It’s a good question. I think it was because people just didn’t play it the way Andy [Hull, Spelunky programmer] and I did while we were developing it, where it was just much more tactical. We didn’t chuck bombs all over the place, we’d wait for that perfect opportunity and try to take out the person when they were vulnerable. Whereas I think most people who tried deathmatch, and maybe multiplayer in general – especially for a game like Spelunky where the deathmatch was never really a part of the core game to begin with – I think expectation played quite a big part. I feel like that’s on us, to get players to understand how to “play the game” properly. I definitely don’t blame the players or anything like that. I think a lot of people do have a lot of fun with it, as a more casual thing. It may also be that adventure mode is more compelling than deathmatch mode.PCG: We’ve got a tournament going in the office. We play 1v1, 12 bombs, 4 ropes, and everything else on default except the ghost, target and AI is toggled off. We find it very tactical with those settings.DY: It’s possible that there are people out there having a lot of fun with deathmatch and it’s just not really being broadcast on the internet where I would be able to find out. I tend not to watch a lot of Spelunky streaming anyways, kinda for the same reason I don’t play it: it’s just slightly stressful for me. I usually just watch the highlights people send me. I think it’s also the case that deathmatch isn’t a very well-explained mode. It’s just there and it’s up to you to figure out what to do with it.PCG: There have been some impressive Spelunky runs: someone killed the ghost, someone got the eggplant to Yama, recently there was a no gold pacifist run. It feels like the community has done everything in this game, but is there any other devious challenge you could set?DY: Oh boy. I don’t think there is! Nothing that’s really within reason. I joked about people playing it blindfolded but I don’t really suggest that, actually. I don’t think Spelunky has enough audio cues to let you do that without a tonne of luck. I said it in the book: people have already completely surpassed our expectations in terms of what can be done in the game. The limits of the game, or what we thought were the limits, aren’t the limits at all – they’ve been surpassed by people like Bananasaurus Rex. At this point anything people do is new and surprising to us.PCG: Did you expect Spelunky to be such a great spectator sport?DY: I didn’t, though I hoped that it would. With Spelunky Classic, I really thought the random nature of the game would limit it as a competitive game, but it’s not been a problem at all – if anything the random nature has made it more exciting for speedrunners and challenge runners. Someone released a speedrun of the original Spelunky and broke down exactly what they were thinking at each spot, and talked about how they used the randomisation to their advantage, how they accounted for the randomisation. There is such a thing as increasing your luck with the randomisation by doing certain things, and that gave me hope that Spelunky would be pretty competitive, despite or because of the randomisation that’s involved in it.PCG: You begin to have an innate feel for how the levels are constructed after a while.DY: That’s the thing that I didn’t necessarily know would be true, working on the game. I think I had a certain intuition about it too, it just seems to work because despite the randomisation it’s not complete chaos. There’s enough in Spelunky that’s handmade versus random or procedurally generated that from run to run, you never see the exact same formations, but you find familiar ones.PCG: I’ve found in my time playing Spelunky that the Black Market is the easiest place to kill the shopkeepers, thanks to the Ankh room. It’s very easy to lob bombs safely down there. Was that deliberate?DY: It wasn’t deliberate but it’s one of those things where I quickly realised that it’s easy to get them there. I didn’t plan it that way per se, it’s just one of those things where it happened to work out, which was the case for a lot of Spelunky. Intuitively I design things a certain way without understanding necessarily why I was doing it that way, but after playing it or having other people play it and watching other people play it, I kinda understood why I did it. As I’m working on a game, I don’t necessarily have these strict ideas in mind, it’s more like feelings. It’s why you have to make a lot of games and spend a lot of time doing it, to build up that intuition. Then I think making games feels more like drawing, which also feels more right and satisfying, and you feel like you’re putting more of yourself into it. It’s better than thinking in terms of nitty-gritty design rules.PCG: I know that Spelunky is feature complete and you’ve moved on, but is there any potential to get Steam Workshop support for it? There are third-party map creation tools out there.DY: To be honest I haven’t thought too much about it. Andy Hull (programmer for Steam + Xbox) would have to want to do it. I’m certainly cool with people using editors and stuff to mod the game with, but I don’t know about Steam Workshop – there would have to be a lot of demand for us to go and muck around in that code again. At this point we’re pretty happy to move on.PCG: Are you working on something at the moment?DY: Yeah, we’re working on a few different things, but unfortunately nothing is far enough along that I can really reveal what it is. The book has taken up a lot of my time during the past year, or over a year. Now that’s winding down I’m spending more time on games again.PCG: Are you working alone on the prototyping and conception?DY: A little bit. It’s hard to say that I’m in solitude now because I have a daughter, so I feel like I’m never alone anymore. I’m also working with other people on things. I’m doing a little bit of the totally solo prototyping which I did when working on Spelunky, but it’s definitely not the same. So much is different now. One is that, like I said in the book, Spelunky really kind of came about because of Aquaria in a way, because I wanted something that was different from Aquaria. That was such a difficult development for me and Alec Holowka [co-creator of Aquaria], so I really needed to decompress and make something very small. I don’t feel that as much with what I’m working on now, because Spelunky, even though every game development is very challenging, I think the development of Spelunky was a challenge that was much less exhausting for me on a mental and spiritual level.PCG: What games are you playing at the moment?DY: I haven’t been playing as many games as I have in the past. Mostly I’ve been playing smaller indie games and mobile titles, because those are the ones that fit my lifestyle more now. Being a parent, I spend a lot of time parenting and when I have free time I want to work, and so my time for playing video games is a lot more limited. I have to sneak it in. Most of last year I played a tonne of Puzzle & Dragons. I think a lot of people saw me Tweeting about that, and thought “why are you playing that?” It’s actually a really good game. It’s quite rewarding in terms of requiring a pretty high level of skill to master and all that. There’s a lot of variety and the fundamental mechanics of the game are very interesting, it’s an extremely innovative extension on basic match three mechanics. I don’t play it as much now, but last year I played it a lot.Other than that I’ve mostly been trying smaller games out. Though I was playing The Witness for quite a bit. That’s the thing, longer form games I have trouble with because I’ll enter a period where I can’t play it much and it’s hard to get back into. What I played of the Witness was really good.PCG: Who’s your favourite Spelunky character?DY: You know, I think I usually just play as the Spelunky guy, the main character. I actually like the little purple girl with the glasses.PCG: She’s my favourite, too!DY: I also like the purple pirate girl. There’s something about purple. Usually I play as Spelunky guy, though. But I do like the underdog characters, I like to play the more interesting or underused ones. I used to play Ken in Street Fighter 2 a lot, but I moved to Dudley in Street Fighter 4 because he was a much more interesting and underused character.Spelunky by Derek Yu is available through Boss Fight Books on March 29, in both digital and physical editions.

      "At this year’s Game Developers Conference, I gave a 30-minute talk with my friend Andy Hull about Spelunky and how it went from being a freeware PC game to the XBLA project that we’re both working on right now. Overall, I think the talk went quite well (whew)! You can find footage of the talk somewhere on GDC Vault, but unfortunately, you have to be a registered member of something or another to view it, so I provided the slides here, with some extra commentary.I gave the first half of the talk. Pretty accurate drawing of me, aside from the sweat! All of my flop sweating over public speaking is internal.A screenshot from the freeware version of the game.I wanted to show here how important the smaller games (on the left) were in terms of how they made the bigger games (on the right) possible. For example, Alec Holowka found me through I’m O.K. and we started working on Aquaria soon after. Not that I don’t think they’re fun games in their own right, of course. Just small.Spelunky XBLA is being built on top of the original Spelunky, which itself was built on top of smaller, unfinished prototypes. When I prototype games, I follow a process that’s similar to how I develop a comic or illustration. After I put down enough doodles, the themes and ideas that are interesting to me start to emerge.I’ve been a fan of roguelikes since I found the MS-DOS port of Hack on a floppy disk my parents kept from graduate school. These are a couple of screenshots from a simple roguelike I started working on after Aquaria.Some of the reasons why roguelikes are amazing but also relatively unpopular, in my opinion.I love platform games, natch.While I was working on my roguelike game, I would take a break and started a few platformers that didn’t get anywhere. However, you can see that some of the graphics from these prototypes made their way into Spelunky.The idea was to combine the pick-up-and-play, instant gratification of a fun platformer with the variety of a roguelike. I wanted the basic interactions in the game to be simple and few, but allow for a lot of improvisation. And I wanted there to be a lot of chances to improvise.To extrapolate the last bullet point, there are some challenges with randomized platform level design that are smoothed over by the implementation of destructible terrain and climbing tools. Plus, caves! Putting your game in a cave is a great excuse to make nonsensical but interesting levels, hehe.I briefly went over the level generation in Spelunky here. First, each level is divided into a grid of 16 rooms.A path is drawn from the entrance of the level at the top, to the exit of the level at the bottom.Each room is selected from a set of room templates. Which set it’s selected from depends on where the room lies on the path from the entrance to the exit.There are randomized “chunks” in each room template that add some variation.Finally, I add the critters, traps, treasures, and other fun stuff! There are some other things to consider (for example, the placement of special rooms), but that’s the basic idea.Generating things algorithmically has its upsides. You can’t develop levels that are as good as hand-made levels, but it’s exciting to run around in a dungeon that you know no one else has ever seen or will ever see again. Plus, when you get yourself out of a bind, it really feels like a miracle!I brought up three examples where people released small projects or “refined prototypes” to great success. Super Meat Boy came from the Flash game Meat Boy, Google has Google Labs, and Haruki Murakami writes short stories between each novel1.I quoted Spore/Spy Party developer Chris Hecker out of context here, but it was for a good reason! The quote is from an Edge Magazine interview with him and Jon, and it goes:And I stated that I like the analogy, but even though many developers choose to be one or the other, I feel that you can be a mulch and tree person both, to great success.Here’s where Andy took over (and yes, he really does have two belly buttons - or at least, one belly button and one thing that looks like a belly button). Andy is doing a bit of everything, but mostly programming. I’ve known him for almost half my life, but this is the first time we’ve ever collaborated on something! He’s a great all-around talent to work with, and a super-nice dude, to boot.A screenshot from the XBLA version of the game.Jon Blow was the one who suggested putting Spelunky on Xbox 360, and after I went “Hmmm… hell yeah!”, he was generous enough to put me in touch with the producer at Microsoft who worked with him on Braid. From there, the game was evaluated by an XBLA team and the rest, as they say, is history!What can I say? Jon is a supremely cool dude and it always feels good when supremely cool dudes take an interest in your game.I don’t see any downsides to polishing up a promising prototype and releasing it as a small game. There’s no way that Jon Blow, Microsoft, or anyone else would have taken an interest in Spelunky if I hadn’t released the original version. A finished game is worth so much.Jon was also kind enough to lend us his Braid engine, as we were such green Xbox developers. We used it for a few months before deciding that, in this particular case, creating our own engine would be a better idea. It was still very helpful as a reference.All-in-all, we didn’t lose too much time to our new engine, and it’s made development smoother once we got back up to speed. There’s definitely a time and a place to roll your own code. Also, I’d personally rather that Jon spend his time working on The Witness than do tech support for us, wouldn’t you agree?The original game is great, but what excited me about Spelunky XBLA was the chance to expand upon the original and try new things. It’s not a true sequel, but it’s also not a remake or port. This segues nicely into a rundown of some of the updates we’re making to the basic game:This comparison image is quite fun to look at. It’s an interesting process to riff off your own artwork like this. There’s all of the fun of re-imagining something without the guilty feeling of being unoriginal! Not that a little explorer-man in a cave is all that original, but you catch my drift.I have a great time doing both pixel art and high-res art - another reason to keep playing with Game Maker in between commercial projects! Now I just need to learn 3d…The interface in the original game was not as smooth as it could have been. A lot of interactions require more button presses than necessary. For example, to buy an item in the original game, you had to pick the item up, which required two button presses, and then hit another button to buy the item. In Spelunky XBLA, you can stand in front of the item and just hit “RB”.We teased some new stuff here! The high-resolution artwork lends itself to a bigger world, with more goodies to play with. And so it shall be!At the end, we made the announcement that Spelunky XBLA will feature co-op multiplayer (offline), although we didn’t go into detail about what other modes will be offered. This was a feature that was requested heavily for the original game, but never made it in due to the amount of work that would be involved. We’ve been developing the XBLA game with it in mind, however.We’re happy with how it’s turning out. Let’s just say that 4x the players = 4x the shenanigans…One of the central themes of our talk was how important it has been for us to have the original Spelunky game out there. As someone who has come to think of his creative life in terms of his larger (2+ year) game projects, I still can’t stress the importance of the smaller releases and how they influenced me. There’s no reason why you cannot work on epic games and fill the time between with smaller projects. They scratch different types of itches2.And that’s the end of the talk! Hope you enjoyed it.1 Murakami explains this process in the introduction to Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman, a collection of his short stories.2 In this video interview with Shinji Mikami, the creator of Resident Evil and the founder of Platinum Games, he expresses his interest in making “all kinds of different small games” (0:46).",
      "Spelunky is a roguelike platformer game for Windows, made in Game Maker, in which the player is meant to grab all the loot they can while surviving the perilous environment.The game is made up of a series of randomly generated levels, in which the player must get from the top of the level down to an exit stairway on the bottom. The player must also deal with enemies, spikes, long falls and traps which, combined with the player's 4 few hearts, creates an unforgiving game experience. The player may also encounter shopkeepers that they can either purchase items from, or steal from causing all future shopkeepers to shoot you on sight. Damsels found in the cave will give you one health if brought to the end of the level alive.You play as a character that looks like Indiana Jones, using all sorts of items like ropes, bombs and jetpacks to get to the lowest part of the cave.Spelunky is getting a port for XBLA with new hand-drawn sprites and impressive lighting effects.SpelunkyDevelopersPC version: Derek Yu\nXBLA version: Derek Yu, Andy Hull, PhlogistonReleased2009GenreProcedural PlatformerModesSingle-player onlyPlatformsPC, XBLA (WIP)InputKeyboard or GamepadWebsiteSpelunky World",

    "title": "The Binding of Isaac",
    "text": [
      "The Binding of Isaac (Hebrew: עֲקֵידַת יִצְחַק‎ Aqedat Yitzhaq, in Hebrew also simply \"The Binding\", הָעֲקֵידָה  Ha-Aqedah) is a story from the Hebrew Bible found in Genesis 22. In the biblical narrative, God asks Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac, on Moriah. Abraham begins to comply, when a messenger from God interrupts him. Abraham then sees a ram and sacrifices it instead.\nThis episode has been the focus of a great deal of commentary in traditional Jewish, Christian, and Muslim sources, as well as being addressed by modern scholarship.\n\n\n== Biblical narrative ==\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, God commands Abraham to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice.[Gen 22:2-8] After Isaac is bound to an altar, a messenger from God  stops Abraham at the last minute, saying \"now I know you fear God.\"  Abraham looks up and sees a ram and sacrifices it instead of Isaac. \n\nThe passage states that the event occurred at \"the mount of the LORD\" in \"the land of Moriah.\" 2 Chronicles 3:1 refers to \"mount Moriah\" as the site of Solomon's Temple, while Psalms 24:3; Isaiah 2:3 & 30:29; and Zechariah 8:3 use the term \"the mount of the LORD\" to refer to the site of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, the location believed to be the Temple Mount in Jerusalem.\n\n\n== Jewish views ==\n\nThe majority of Jewish religious commentators argue that God was testing Abraham to see if he would actually kill his own son, as a test of his loyalty. However, a number of Jewish Biblical commentators from the medieval era, and many in the modern era, read the text in another way.The early rabbinic midrash Genesis Rabbah imagines God as saying \"I never considered telling Abraham to slaughter Isaac (using the Hebrew\nroot letters for \"slaughter\", not \"sacrifice\")\". Rabbi Yona Ibn Janach (Spain, 11th century) wrote that God demanded only a symbolic sacrifice. Rabbi Yosef Ibn Caspi (Spain, early 14th century) wrote that Abraham's \"imagination\" led him astray, making him believe that he had been commanded to sacrifice his son. Ibn Caspi writes \"How could God command such a revolting thing?\" However, according to Joseph Hertz, Chief Rabbi of the British Empire, child sacrifice was actually \"rife among the Semitic peoples\", and he suggests that \"in that age, it was astounding that Abraham's God should have interposed to prevent the sacrifice, not that He should have asked for it.\" Hertz interprets the Akedah as demonstrating to the Jews that human sacrifice is abhorrent.In The Binding of Isaac, Religious Murders & Kabbalah, Lippman Bodoff argues that Abraham never intended to actually sacrifice his son, and that he had faith that God had no intention that he do so. Rabbi Ari Kahn (on the Orthodox Union website) elaborates this view as follows: Isaac's death was never a possibility — not as far as Abraham was concerned, and not as far as God was concerned. God’s commandment to Abraham was very specific, and Abraham understood it very precisely: Isaac was to be \"raised up as an offering\", and God would use the opportunity to teach humankind, once and for all, that human sacrifice, child sacrifice, is not acceptable. This is precisely how the sages of the Talmud (Taanit 4a) understood the Akedah. Citing the Prophet Jeremiah’s exhortation against child sacrifice (Chapter 19), they state unequivocally that such behavior \"never crossed God’s mind\", referring specifically to the sacrificial slaughter of Isaac. Though readers of this parashah throughout the generations have been disturbed, even horrified, by the Akeida, there was no miscommunication between God and Abraham. The thought of actually killing Isaac never crossed their minds.Others suggest that Abraham's apparent complicity with the sacrifice was actually his way of testing God. Abraham had previously argued with God to save lives in Sodom and Gomorrah. By silently complying with God's instructions to kill Isaac, Abraham was putting pressure on God to act in a moral way to preserve life. More evidence that Abraham thought that he would not actually sacrifice Isaac comes from Genesis 22:5, where Abraham said to his servants, \"You stay here with the ass. The boy and I will go up there; we will worship and we will return to you.\" By saying we (as opposed to I), he meant that both he and Isaac would return. Thus, he did not believe that Isaac would be sacrificed in the end.In The Guide for the Perplexed, Maimonides argues that the story of the Binding of Isaac contains two \"great notions\". First, Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac demonstrates the limit of humanity's capability to both love and fear God. Second, because Abraham acted on a prophetic vision of what God had asked him to do, the story exemplifies how prophetic revelation has the same truth value as philosophical argument and thus carries equal certainty, notwithstanding the fact that it comes in a dream or vision.In Glory and Agony: Isaac's Sacrifice and National Narrative, Yael S. Feldman argues that the story of Isaac's Binding, in both its biblical and post-biblical versions (the New Testament included) has had a great impact on the ethos of altruist heroism and self-sacrifice in modern Hebrew national culture. As her study demonstrates, over the last century the \"Binding of Isaac\" has morphed into the \"Sacrifice of Isaac\", connoting both the glory and agony of heroic death on the battlefield.In Legends of the Jews, rabbi Louis Ginzberg argues that the binding of Isaac is a way of God to test Isaac's claim to Ishmael, and to silence Satan's protest about Abraham who had not brought up any offering to God after Isaac was born, also to show a proof to the world that Abraham is the true god-fearing man who ready to fulfill any God's commands, even to sacrifice his own son:\n\nWhen God commanded the father to desist from sacrificing Isaac, Abraham said: \"One man tempts another, because he knoweth not what is in the heart of his neighbor. But Thou surely didst know that I was ready to sacrifice my son!\"God: \"It was manifest to Me, and I foreknew it, that thou wouldst withhold not even thy soul from Me.\"Abraham: \"And why, then, didst Thou afflict me thus?\"God: \"It was My wish that the world should become acquainted with thee, and should know that it is not without good reason that I have chosen thee from all the nations. Now it hath been witnessed unto men that thou fearest God.\"\n\nThe Book of Genesis does not tell the age of Isaac at the time. Some Talmudic sages teach that Isaac was an adult in his age of thirty seven, likely based on the next biblical story, which is of Sarah's death at 127 years[Genesis 23:1], being 90 when Isaac was born[Genesis 17:17, 21]. Isaac's reaction to the binding is unstated in the biblical narrative. Some commentators have argued that he was traumatized and angry, often citing the fact that he and Abraham are never seen to speak to each other again; however, Jon D. Levenson notes that they never speak before the binding, either.\n\n\n== Christian views ==\n\nThe Binding of Isaac is mentioned in the New Testament Epistle to the Hebrews among many acts of faith recorded in the Old Testament: \"By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten son, of whom it was said, 'In Isaac your seed shall be called,' concluding that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead, from which he also received him in a figurative sense.\" (Hebrews 11:17–19, NKJV)\nAbraham's faith in God is such that he felt God would be able to resurrect the slain Isaac, in order that his prophecy (Genesis 21:12) might be fulfilled. Early Christian preaching sometimes accepted Jewish interpretations of the binding of Isaac without elaborating. For example, Hippolytus of Rome says in his Commentary on the Song of Songs, \"The blessed Isaac became desirous of the anointing and he wished to sacrifice himself for the sake of the world\" (On the Song 2:15). Other Christians from the period saw Isaac as a type of the \"Word of God\" who prefigured Christ. The majority of Christian Biblical commentators view this episode as prefiguring God's plan to have his own Son, Jesus, die on the cross as a substitute for humanity, much like the ram God provided for Abraham. This fulfilled Abraham's reply to Isaac's question of where was the animal that would be used for the sacrifice; Abraham's affirmation that \"God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering\" is seen as a prophetic foreshadow of the promise of the Lamb of God. Abraham's willingness to give up his own son Isaac is seen, in this view, as foreshadowing the willingness of God the Father to sacrifice his Son; also contrasted is Isaac's submission in the whole ordeal with Christ's, the two choosing to lay down their own lives in order for the will of God to be accomplished, as no struggle is mentioned in the Genesis account.\n\n\n== Muslim views ==\n\nThe version in the Quran differs from that in Genesis. \nIn Islamic sources, when Abraham tells his son about the vision, his son accepted to be sacrificed for the fulfillment of God's command, and no binding to the altar occurred. The Quran states that when Abraham asked for a righteous son, God granted him a son possessing forbearance. When the son was able to walk and work with him, Abraham saw a vision about sacrificing his son, Ishmael. When he told his son about it, his son agreed to fulfill the command of God in the vision. When they both had submitted their will to God and were ready for the sacrifice, God told Abraham he had fulfilled the vision, and provided him with a ram to sacrifice instead. God promised to reward Abraham. The next two verses state God also granted Abraham the righteous son Isaac and promised more rewards.Among early Muslim scholars, however, there was a dispute over the identity of the son. The argument of those early scholars who believed it was Isaac rather than Ishmael (notably ibn Qutaybah and al-Tabari) was that \"God's perfecting his mercy on Abraham and Isaac\" referred to his making Abraham his friend, and to his rescuing Isaac. On the contrary, the other parties held that the promise to Sarah was of a son, Isaac, and a grandson, Jacob (Sura 11:71–74) excluded the possibility of a premature death of Isaac.\nAnd it has become the mainstream Muslim view that it was the first-born son Ismail, not Isaac, who was asked to be sacrificed in the vision, and that the second son Isaac was born later as one of the rewards for Abraham's fulfillment of his vision.The submission of Abraham and his son is celebrated and commemorated by Muslims on the days of Eid al-Adha. During the festival, those who can afford and the ones in the pilgrimage sacrifice a ram, cow, sheep or a camel. Part of the sacrifice meat is eaten by the household and remaining is distributed to the neighbors and the needy. The festival marks the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.\nIn Islam, the site of al-Marwah near the Kaaba is identified with the Moriah mentioned in the Book of Genesis.\n\n\n== Modern research ==\n\n\n=== Redactors and narrative purpose ===\nModern scholars operating under the framework of the documentary hypothesis commonly ascribe the Binding's narrative to the biblical source E, on the grounds that it generally uses the specific term Elohim (אלוהים) and parallels characteristic E compositions. On that view, the second angelic appearance to Abraham (v. 14–18), praising his obedience and blessing his offspring, is in fact a later Jahwist interpolation to E’s original account (v. 1–13, 19). This is supported by the style and composition of these verses, as well as by the use of the name Yahweh for the deity.In Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature, the literary critic Erich Auerbach considers the Hebrew narrative of the Binding of Isaac, along with Homer's description of Odysseus's scar, as the two paradigmatic models for the representation of reality in literature. Auerbach contrasts Homer's attention to detail and foregrounding of the spatial, historical, as well as personal contexts for events to the Bible's sparse account, in which virtually all context is kept in the background or left outside of the narrative. As Auerbach observes, this narrative strategy virtually compels readers to add their own interpretations to the text.\n\n\n=== Ethical responsibility ===\nMore recent studies question the analysis of E and J as strictly separate. Coats argues that Abraham’s obedience to God’s command in fact necessitates praise and blessing, which he only receives in the second angelic speech. That speech, therefore, could not have been simply inserted into E’s original account. This has suggested to many that the author responsible for the interpolation of the second angelic appearance has left his mark also on the original account (v. 1–13, 19).More recently it has been suggested that these traces are in fact the first angelic appearance (v. 11–12), in which the Angel of YHWH stops Abraham before he kills Isaac. The style and composition of these verses resemble that of the second angelic speech, and YHWH is used for the deity rather than God. On that reading, in the original E version of the Binding Abraham disobeys God’s command, sacrificing the ram \"instead of his son\" (v. 13) on his own responsibility and without being stopped by an angel: \"And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son; but Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and beheld, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went, and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son\" (v. 10, 13).\nBy interpolating the first appearance of the angel, a later redactor shifted responsibility for halting the test from Abraham to the angel (v. 11–12). The second angelic appearance, in which Abraham is rewarded for his obedience (v. 14–18), became necessary due to that shift of responsibility. This analysis of the story sheds light on the connection between the Binding and the story of Sodom (Genesis 18), in which Abraham protests against God's unethical plan to destroy the city, without distinguishing between the righteous and the wicked: \"Far be it from you to do such a thing: Shall not the judge of all the earth do what is just?\" Abraham's ethical rebellion against God in the destruction of Sodom culminates in his disobedience to God, refusing to sacrifice Isaac.The Binding also figures prominently in the writings of several of the more important modern theologians, such as Søren Kierkegaard in Fear and Trembling and Shalom Spiegel in The Last Trial. Jewish communities regularly review this literature, for instance the recent mock trial held by more than 600 members of the University Synagogue of Orange County, California. Derrida also looks at the story of the sacrifice as well as Kierkegaard’s reading in The Gift of Death.\n\n\n=== Possible child sacrifice ===\n\nFrancesca Stavrakopoulou has speculated that it is possible that the story \"contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac. R.E. Friedman argued that in the original E story, Abraham may have carried out the sacrifice of Isaac, but that later repugnance at the idea of a human sacrifice led the redactor of JE to add the lines in which a ram is substituted for Isaac. Likewise, Terence Fretheim wrote that the text bears no specific mark of being a polemic against child sacrifice.Some scholars also point at the genealogical snippet (verses 20–24) as containing a hint to the question whether Abraham sacrificed Isaac or not.\n\nFirst of all, the description of a rash of newborns placed right after the main story suggests the existence of some direct cause-effect connection between the two. From the perspective of a sacrificial economy, such a numerous progeny could not have been conceived without the preceding payment in an appropriate ‘currency’.Secondly, the said passage is problematic due to its onomastic content. The verses 20–23 list the progeny of Nahor and Milkah while v. 24 adds the offspring conceived with Re’umah, said to be his concubine.However, whereas verses 20–23 have some significant links with other parts of the Hebrew Bible as well as with the historical and cultural entourage of the ancient Near East, such connections are absent in v. 24. The very name of Nahor’s concubine appears here exclusively and in no other place in the Hebrew Bible is Re’umah mentioned. The same applies to her children’s names with the exception of Ma‘akah which is sometimes utilized in the historical books. The extreme rarity of these appellations demands some alternative interpretation with regards to its purpose.\nAccordingly, the personal list may contain some \"coded\" explanation concerning the rest of the story:\n\nRe’umah (ראומה) – \"see what\"\nTevah (טבח) – \"slaughtering\" or \"slaughtered\"\nGaham (גחם) – \"flame\" or \"burning\"\nTahash (תחש) – \"skin\" often used to describe the tabernacle’s covering\nMa‘akah (מעכה) – \"blown\" or \"crushed\"In other words, v. 24 begins with an interpretational invitation and continues with the names which seem to explain the cause of the rash of newborns present at the conclusion of the pericope: Somebody had been blown, slaughtered, put on the tabernacle, and burned.\n\n\n=== Rite of Passage ===\nIt has been suggested that Genesis 22 contains an intrusion of the liturgy of a rite of passage, including mock sacrifice, as commonly found in early and preliterate societies, marking the passage from youth to adulthood.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSymposium on the Sacrifice of Isaac in the Three Monotheistic Religions\nThe Sacrifice of Isaac in Medieval English Drama\nMystery play texts in the cycles from Chester, Wakefield, York and n-Town\nShofar Callin' (G-dcast's animated retelling of the Binding of Isaac, to a hip hop soundtrack)",

      "Edmund McMillen is the one of the two creators of The Binding of Isaac, the other being Florian Himsl, who programmed the game. He also helped in creating other video games, such as Super Meat Boy, Gish, and Aether.McMillen has been a lifelong resident of Santa Cruz, California. In spite of the city's scenic attraction, he preferred to stay in-doors. He was especially fond of drawing, his favorite subjects being monsters. Some of his drawings were deemed so disturbing that his third grade teacher recommended that he be given a psychological evaluation. Edmund spent most of his childhood with his grandmother, whom he considers to be the greatest source of support in his creative endeavors.McMillen's initial graphic work was in independent comics. While he has largely abandoned this field in favor of video games, he has released a series of comics featuring Meat Boy, the title character in the video game Super Meat Boy, as a promotional tie-in for the game. His most well-known games are the Flash-based game Meat Boy, and its much-lauded sequel Super Meat Boy, which has been released for the Xbox 360 platform and PC. McMillen is also known for the award-winning games Gish, Aether and Coil. Gish won Game Tunnel's 2004 Adventure Game of the Year, as well as Indie Game of the Year. His game Coil was nominated for the Innovation Award at the 2009 Independent Games Festival. McMillen was the original character artist and animator on Braid before those assets were replaced by the work of David Hellman. Braid went on to win the Innovation Award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival prior to its release, and several awards in 2008, including GameSpot's Best Platformer, and Best Original Downloadable Console Game, and the 12th Annual Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences Awards Casual Game of the Year. His game Aether was a 2009 IndieCade finalist and received an honorable mention.Adrian Gaurilita • Alex Hicks • Alon Dan • Edmund McMillen • Eduardo Aparicio • Florian Himsl • James ID • J.B. • Jeremy Stevens • John Goodrich • Jon Evans • Matthias Bossi • Matt Kap • Michael Stevens • Mike Lambert • Myumi Kaunowski • Peter McAlpine • Simon Parzer • Tadd Nuznov • Tim Romero • Tyrone Rodriguez • Victor Rodriguez • Wayne Kubiak",
      "By\nAnthony McGlynn\n2018-06-06T01:31:10.156ZOn April 30, the last official add-on scheduled for The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ was released. Booster Pack #5 contained 'The Forgotten' and a treasure trove of bits and bobs, including \"White Poop, a new poop type.\" It's been quiet since then. For the first time since the original incarnation of the randomly generated gross-out dungeon crawler was released in 2011, it seems like Isaac may finally get to rest.At least, in game-form. \"There's a lot of little things I want to add and that I really want to explore with the IP that I haven't been able to because I've been mostly just working on the game,\" Binding of Isaac co-creator Edmund McMillen tells me. \"Without revealing too much information, yeah, there's stuff on the horizon.\"Isaac and he have now been together for the bulk of a decade, a period that's seen all kinds of change in the games industry and in his personal life. Isaac's come to symbolize the kind of auteur-driven success many enter the medium to obtain, with the kind of longevity major publishers fall over themselves to replicate. And it all started with a two-week game-jam.Wanting to take a vacation post-2010's Super Meat Boy, McMillen chose to stay home and make a quick passion project with friend Florian Himsl as a way to unwind. Two weeks gradually became three months, and friends started telling them they should consider making the thing into a proper release. \"It was just one of those situations where everything clicked together and it was too hard to put down, but I also didn't see any means of actually selling it,\" McMillen says, \"because at the time it was Flash and I didn't think Steam would be interested or even allow Flash games on Steam.\"Indie distribution was still finding its feet, and they considered simply selling the IP to someone like Adult Swim for a big down payment. However, encouragement from those in the know pushed McMillen to overcome his assumptions and reach out to his contact at Valve to see if Steam would give Isaac a look. Thankfully, they did, and soon Isaac was available to the world.But back then Isaac was a very leftfield piece of work. Nowadays its core elements are common, but in 2011 the response was muted. Review scores were decent, but nobody really seemed to get what was really on. \"They just kinda put it aside, it was a lot of 'oh it's like a remix of Legend of Zelda, and it's pretty cool,'\" McMillen says. \"It was like, OK, well, I don't know how I'm supposed to sell this thing.\"It wasn't until Let's Plays latched onto the game that things started to snowball. Hours of videos demonstrating the ever-changing longplay aspect of Isaac on YouTube generated a sudden spike in interest. McMillen remains at a loss as to why people enjoy watching it, but the benefits were quick and significant. \"100-200 copies, 1,000 copies a day—that summer, the first summer after release, which was probably nine months after release, is when it just exploded, and it just kept climbing higher and higher and higher.\"Little did he know that a steadfast community was forming, and that it would prove integral to Isaac's longevity. Ryder Hicks, owner of The Modding of Isaac, was one of them. \"I had some friends on Steam that were playing it and I was like 'What is this?' and I watched the trailer and it was very bizarre,\" he says. \"And I was like 'all right I gotta try this' and it was amazing.\"The Modding of Isaac is a community forum for fanmade Isaac creations. Through the 2014 remake The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth and beyond, modding it has become easier and easier, drawing in more creators. Hicks had run a modded Team Fortress 2 server for years, and wanted to help this community grow in the same way, working to preserve mods and encourage their creators. \"It's so easy to mod and add stuff that you think might be interesting,\" he says. \"If you're like, able to theme it in properly, you can make it some pretty cool stuff by yourself, not really having to put in a whole lot of work.\"The modding scene blindsided McMillen, but has since become vital to The Binding of Isaac. The-Vinh Truong, aka '_Kilburn', now an integral Isaac team-member, began as lead designer on one of the biggest mods, Anti-Birth. \"Initially I didn't want it to be anything too big, just a few items and enemies, and then Afterbirth came out and we hadn't finished our mod yet,\" Truong says of Anti-Birth. \"But we saw what that added and thought maybe we could use this as an opportunity to show what we could do.\"Anti-Birth is a testament to how inspirational Binding of Isaac has been. It's a massive slab of new stuff, containing intuitive bosses and clever items built by Truong and his friends in their spare time. During our interview, McMillen can barely restrain himself from singing the modder's praises, going so far as to call him the best collaborator he's ever had. \"There's a lot of great modders out there, but he's on a whole other level,\" McMillen says enthusiastically. \"I feel like he understands me in a way that I'm not completely aware of yet.\" Truong is considerably more modest: \"[People] don't always get what the game is supposed to be like. I'm not going to pretend that I do, but I try. I guess I do my best.\"At this stage, McMillen is very aware of the crossroads facing Isaac. The free updates were becoming more and more elaborate, and the question of a sequel has been looming. The additions contained by Booster Packs were starting to make their way uncomfortably close to his list of ideas for a sequel. Ending the updates now is as much about putting a formal follow-up into perspective as anything else.\"When people ask what would you do to improve the game, there's a bunch of stuff that I would do. And I probably say that the first thing that I would do is strip out the story bosses,\" he says, on the subject of possibilities for number two. \"Like, after you get to a certain point in the game, no more story bosses. No Mom, no Satan, all those dead-end bosses. Then I would design bosses that are more difficult and randomize them into those slots, and then you'd have a more random experience. That's where I'm heading just for a base level design for a sequel.\"The current game is now at a critical mass, as he puts it, and any more big additions would require uprooting the carpet and taking down the upholstery. It would require another re-design, when a blank slate with new foundations makes more sense. After the troubled development of Afterbirth+, during which Edmund was absent for four months due to personal issues, he's keen to make sure everything they put out is as consistent and worthwhile as possible.Though he loves The Binding of Isaac and loves working on it, it eventually became work. After several years of various ups and downs professionally and personally, McMillen was ready to quit games and take his life elsewhere, a feeling he dealt with in a familiar way—by making a game about it. \"The End Is Nigh was by far the most cathartic experience I'd ever had,\" McMillen says of his macabre 2017 platformer. \"I was ready to be done with games. I just wasn't getting what I have gotten out of it. I just had a bunch of terrible experiences when it comes to designing and working with people.\"Formed from the husk of previously announced but unfinished Ouroboros, The End Is Nigh let him really ponder if everything had been worth it. It's a story of perseverance by any means, challenging you to find the motivation to try again and again, without the promise of a happy ending. Thematically, it was his toughest undertaking, and he considers it one of the best games he's made.Right now, McMillen is seeing where the wind takes him. Later this year there's Legend of Bum-bo, a Binding of Isaac prequel, and he mentions a desire to release smaller, weirder games in the future. After nearly quitting two years ago, now he sounds optimistic, no doubt bolstered by having Vinh around to riff ideas with and Ryder's site collecting together Isaac's ardent fans. But whatever comes next, he's resolute that the ending of Binding of Isaac has already happened.\"The Forgotten in itself is the final ending of the game. You loosely see that Isaac's bones have his soul chained to the ground because of how he died,\" he explains. \"It puts into question what happened and why, and where is he now. In the story of the game, that is its conclusion, and I don't see myself adding any more to that.\"Subscribe to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

      "Poppy is a proofreader and Dragon Age fan. She lives in Tokyo and has two hamsters named Zelda and Hemingway.The Binding of Isaac (2011) is an indie game created by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl, that found huge success on the PC platform Steam, and has been the talking point of many gamers since its release.  This article will briefly explain the plotline and the various theories put forward to interpret Isaac's world, items, monsters, and bosses.The Binding of Isaac's introduction is based off the Bible story of the same name. Isaac and his mother live alone together; he keeps to himself, playing with toys and his games console whilst his mother watches Christian broadcasts on TV. One day she hears the voice of God telling her that Isaac has become corrupted and needs to be saved. This happens three times, where his mother:Isaac finds a trapdoor in his bedroom and escapes down it, away from his mother - and the game begins.The basement consists of several floors, each with various items, enemies and rooms, and all with some kind of boss before Isaac can descend to the next floor. The game is very similar to the old game boy version of The Legend of Zelda, where McMillen could have got some of his ideas from.The game was cartoony; Isaac's 'weapon' to defeat enemies were his tears, and moved around naked and crying. Enemies were often covered in blood, screaming or groaning, or represented some kind of pain or suffering. The bosses seemed to translate to something deeper than just something scary that needed to be defeated. The game itself is brilliant, and I still enjoy playing it today - but there is always the creeping sense of dread as I'm playing it, as if there are darker adult themes behind the simplistic cartoon. I've played this game for about a year or more, and have come up with various theories and interpretations which I will apply to this article.Wikipedia says that the game \"touches on dark, adult themes including child abuse, gender identity, infanticide, neglect, suicide, abortion, and how religion might negatively affect a child; all concepts which video games generally avoid.\"Firstly, the world itself. Isaac explores a seemingly endless basement, which is similar to the dungeons in \"The Legend of Zelda\". There are three possibilities that the basement represents:There are various monsters in the basement who Isaac has to defeat to move onto the next room, and items that he can collect.All of the above suggest that Isaac suffers some kind of abuse and fear in his life - from his mother, it seems, as they live alone, and other children. Maybe this is the reason that Isaac \"keeps to himself\".It was difficult to tell whether gender identity was actually explored in the Binding of Isaac, or it was just because Isaac is a small child. However, upon further playthrough, I did notice some reasons why Wikipedia could have suggested this.The theory that Isaac could be actually hiding in the basement to escape his angry mother can be applied here.The bosses seemed to have some kind of reference to Isaac's fears, taking shape of things he might have heard or seen in his life. Here are some theories I came up with.A lot of the enemies and items refer to religion.All of these hidden meanings and possible interpretations, together with Isaac's crying and the game's music, I always get a feeling of sadness when playing this game.  McMillen did an excellent job of creating an entirely original plot, characters and enemies that made for a thought-provoking experience.  I give Binding of Isaac four stars out of five.Â© 2014 PoppyTo comment on this article, you must sign in or sign up and post using a HubPages Network account.Hi Eric! Thank you for commenting. It’s a great game for sure!The Binding of Isaac Rebirth is one of my favorite computer games. Nice article.  I also wondered a bit about the story and meaning of it.Great article! The Binding of Isaac is my favourite indie game and once I was also very interested in the plot of the game and I studied much of the content but your hub also had some new information for me :)Ps: If you are interested, there is a review on my Hubpage to Isaac: Rebirth ^^Thank you for your comment.  I agree, the Silent Hill games were also really powerful by showing you the minimal amount of details.  With horror I really believe less is more.These are very interesting insights. This game is indeed very dark and unsettling. In a way it reminds me of the early Silent Hill games (the first two), where the horror elements where not what you could see, but the ideas the images generated in your own mind.Copyright © 2018 HubPages Inc. and respective owners.

      "If Abraham had killed Isaac on that mountaintop things would’ve been very straightforward: God asks man to kill son. Man kills son. God is happy. Man, less so. It gets thorny because God tells Abraham to stop at the last second. Abraham, stalwart in his faith before, must have thought that God, his own father in a sense, was, to say the least, a bit out of line. To sacrifice his only son he had left. Poor Isaac, Abraham’s only son, forever scarred, his relationship with his father irreparable. The story is supposed to be, in context, about the shift away from paganism and human sacrifice. About the benevolence of this new God.The Binding of Isaac, by Florial Himsl and Edmund McMillen, is the latest interpretation of the story. An intro explains how Isaac’s mother shifted from well-meaning single parent to a deadly Bible-thumping zealot. Told by the televangelist voices in her head that Isaac’s obsession with Dungeons & Dragons is evil, she goes to kill him. Isaac escapes to the basement in the hopes of escaping and, perhaps, defeating her. McMillen and Himsl bring the subtext of the original story up to the surface: Parents can cause a world of hurt.Isaac is a twin-stick shooter (one set of arrows to move, another set to shoot). This is a first for McMillen, who made his name in platformers (and who has already proven himself with classics like Super Meat Boy and the under-appreciated Time Fcuk). Each time you play the game, elements are randomized. Power-ups, for example, will appear in one game, but not another. These include pharmaceutical pills that can do as much harm as good, or a Tarot deck that gives arcane powers (notice that it’s only after Isaac’s mom tries to kill him that he turns to the dark arts). As a game, yes, the variety means I’ll encounter new enemies and imaginative unlockables every time I play. A sense of discovery and novelty drives me to play again. This also means that the symbolism and metaphors in the game come in and out of focus, new meanings and associations happening by accident. In one session I got “Mom’s Panties” and “Mom’s Bra.” Each has an in-game benefit to Isaac’s stats, but as a player I imagined Isaac as a closeted kid who felt uncomfortable in a male body. I wanted to hug him and tell him that it gets better.McMillen’s aesthetic has never been a personal favourite. Blood, guts, gore, and bodily fluids coat all of his games. Spewer, for example, has the protagonist propelling itself across the stage with vomit. In most of McMillen’s games, puke and gore are played for laughs, but here they’re accompanied by a dark undercurrent. Isaac doppelgängers roam some stages, bleeding from their eyes, all the more sickly because of their smile. Isaac fights off enemies with his tears, a game mechanic wrapped up in a metaphor if I’ve ever seen one. The less said about the womb stage the better.Or maybe not. Binding is obsessed with origins. The game is a pastiche of old-school ideas. The hearts and dungeon styles are pure Zelda. The random level generation harkens back to Rogue. There is an enemy that pays homage to Bomberman. I have a sneaking suspicion that the trapdoor hidden under a rug that’s mentioned in the intro is a Zork reference. To say nothing of the original story from Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament. The Binding of Isaac isn’t really about Isaac’s mother trying to kill him. The game is the beginning of the rest of Isaac’s life. Will he permanently be the troubled kid cowed by his mother, or will he become his own person, able to deal with his fears in the real world? It’s a troubling metaphor, and when I read people writing that the developers need professional help, I point at this game and say, “This is therapy.”",
      "The Binding of Isaac is a independent roguelike video game designed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl.In The Binding of Isaac you play as the titular character, a loose tribute to the biblical story of Isaac. After Isaac's mother attempts to sacrifice him in the name of God, he runs away down a trapdoor in their home and the game begins.For in-depth Details, Guides, How To's, and more about The Binding of Isaac; Click here.Current System Requirements as of May 2016.Current System Requirements as of May 2016.N/AWebsitehttp://bindingofisaac.comSteamhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/Xboxhttps://store.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-One/Games/The-Binding-of-Isaac-Rebirth/bb3242c7-7da5-4e9c-b030-cbc545ff278aPlaystationhttps://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/cid=UP2103-CUSA00792_00-BINDINGOFISAACP4SubredditbindingofisaacWikishttp://bindingofisaacrebirth.gamepedia.comOSWindows XP, Vista, 7Processor2.5 GHzGPUDirect X9.0c Compatible CardHD Space50 MBRAM1 GBDirectX9.0cOSOS X version Leopard 10.5.8 / Snow Leopard 10.6.3 or laterProcessorIntel Mac 2.5 GHzGPUN/AHD Space50 MBRAM1 GB",

ИгроманыДобавлено: 26 июн 2018, 16:54\n\n\n\n Год выпуска: 28 сентября 2011г.  Жанр: Indie, Arcade   Разработчик:  Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl  Издатель: Edmund McMillen Тип издания: лицензия (Steam-Rip)  Язык интерфейса:Английский.  Язык озвучки: Английский.  Таблетка: присутствует (THETA) Системные требования:  > Операционная система: Windows XP SP3, Vista SP1, Windows 7  > Процессор: с тактовой частотой 2,5 ГГц   > Оперативная память: 1 гб  > Видеокарта: совместимая с Direct X9.0c  > Звуковая карта: Звуковое устройство, совместимое с DirectX® 9.0с  > Свободное место на жестком диске: 400мб Описание:    The Binding of Isaac - новый проект Эдмунда МакМиллена, соавтора невыносимо сложного платформера Super Meat Boy. Действие игры, выдержанной в жанре Rogue-подобной экшен/RPG, происходит в подвале дома, где живет главный герой Айзек. Мальчишка сбегает на цокольный этаж после того, как его сумасшедшая мамаша, ведомая божьим наставлением, загорается желанием возложить своего сына на жертвенный алтарь. В подвале Айзека поджидают мерзкие существа, рожденные из его собственных страхов...  Случайно генерируемые уровни, сотни предметов и десятки боссов - каждое прохождение игры будет уникальным. Узнаваемый визуальный стиль, безобразные, но одновременно трогательные персонажи, а также жутковатый, абсолютно сумасшедший юмор — этого тут хватает.  Дополнение Wrath of the Lamb добавляет в игру массу новых предметов, глав, врагов, боссов и других отвратительных бонусов.

ИгроманыДобавлено: 26 июн 2018, 16:54\n\n\n\n Год выпуска: 28 сентября 2011г.  Жанр: Indie, Arcade   Разработчик:  Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl  Издатель: Edmund McMillen Тип издания: лицензия (Steam-Rip)  Язык интерфейса:Английский.  Язык озвучки: Английский.  Таблетка: присутствует (THETA) Системные требования:  > Операционная система: Windows XP SP3, Vista SP1, Windows 7  > Процессор: с тактовой частотой 2,5 ГГц   > Оперативная память: 1 гб  > Видеокарта: совместимая с Direct X9.0c  > Звуковая карта: Звуковое устройство, совместимое с DirectX® 9.0с  > Свободное место на жестком диске: 400мб Описание:    The Binding of Isaac - новый проект Эдмунда МакМиллена, соавтора невыносимо сложного платформера Super Meat Boy. Действие игры, выдержанной в жанре Rogue-подобной экшен/RPG, происходит в подвале дома, где живет главный герой Айзек. Мальчишка сбегает на цокольный этаж после того, как его сумасшедшая мамаша, ведомая божьим наставлением, загорается желанием возложить своего сына на жертвенный алтарь. В подвале Айзека поджидают мерзкие существа, рожденные из его собственных страхов...  Случайно генерируемые уровни, сотни предметов и десятки боссов - каждое прохождение игры будет уникальным. Узнаваемый визуальный стиль, безобразные, но одновременно трогательные персонажи, а также жутковатый, абсолютно сумасшедший юмор — этого тут хватает.  Дополнение Wrath of the Lamb добавляет в игру массу новых предметов, глав, врагов, боссов и других отвратительных бонусов.

      "The Binding of Isaac is the result of putting The Legend of Zelda, Smash TV, a roguelike, and a couple of dead baby jokes into a blender...and hitting Liquefy.An expansion pack, Wrath of the Lamb, added more enemies, more levels, more items, more dungeon features, more bosses, more unused content, and more bugs.Three years after release, a remake of the game was released, titled The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.Powerup_Zelda_HeadliftWhen Wrath of the Lamb was released, a lot of room layouts were added; in fact, a handful of rooms were added that are never able to be seen in-game! These rooms exist only in the flash assets and their ID values are never generated in-game, but Cheat Engine can be used to reveal them. They are all fully functional; they were either purposefully left out or (most likely) omitted due to an oversight during room generation.Surprisingly, there are 11 unused rooms for Sheol; however, all of these rooms save for one have an equivalent in the Cathedral that is used in-game. Some of them also appear to be similar to already existing Sheol rooms.Basement Room B1Basement Room B2Cellar Room B2Caves Room A9Caves Room AACatacombs Room AADepths Room 9ADepths Room 9BNecropolis Room 9BWomb Room 89Utero Room 89Sheol Room 52Sheol Room 53Sheol Room 54Sheol Room 55Sheol Room 56Sheol Room 57Sheol Room 58Sheol Room 59Sheol Room 5ASheol Room 5BSheol Room 5CCathedral Room 5CChest Room 06Chest Room 07Developers: Edmund McMillen, \nFlorian HimslPublisher: \nEdmund McMillenPlatform: \nWindowsReleased internationally: September 28, 2011\n\n\n This game has unused areas.

      "FTL: Faster Than Light is a space-based top-down real-time strategy roguelike game created by indie developer Subset Games, which was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in September 2012. In the game, the player controls the crew of a single spacecraft, holding critical information to be delivered to an allied fleet, while being pursued by a large rebel fleet. The player must guide the spacecraft over eight sectors, each with planetary systems and events procedurally generated in a roguelike fashion, while facing rebel and other hostile forces, recruiting new crew, and outfitting and upgrading their ship. Combat takes place in pausable real time, and if the ship is destroyed or all of its crew lost, the game ends, forcing the player to restart with a new ship.\nThe concept for FTL was based on tabletop board games and other non-strategic space combat video games that required the player to manage an array of ship's functions. The initial development by the two-man Subset Games was self-funded, and guided towards developing entries for various indie game competitions. With positive responses from the players and judges at these events, Subset opted to engage in a crowd-sourced Kickstarter campaign to finish the title, and succeeded in obtaining twenty times more than they had sought; the extra funds were used towards more professional art, music and in-game writing.\nThe game, considered one of the major successes of the Kickstarter fundraisers for video games, was released in September 2012 to positive reviews. An updated version, FTL: Advanced Edition, added additional ships, events, and other gameplay elements, and was released in April 2014 as a free update for existing owners and was put up for purchase on iPad devices. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's creativity. FTL is recognized alongside games like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac that helped popularize indie \"roguelike-like\" games that use some but not all of the principles of a classical roguelike.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe player controls a spacecraft capable of traveling faster-than-light (FTL). It belongs to the Galactic Federation, which is on the verge of collapse after losing a war with an exclusively human rebel faction. The player's crew intercepts a data packet from the rebel fleet containing information that could throw the rebels into disarray and ensure a Federation victory. The goal is to reach Federation headquarters, waiting several space sectors away, while avoiding destruction from hostile ships or by the pursuing rebel fleet. The final sector ends with a battle against the Rebel Flagship, a multi-stage fight which results in victory or defeat for the Federation.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nAt game start, the player chooses a spacecraft with several specific systems rooms (piloting, engines, weapons, life support, etc.), and a crew. The game randomly generates eight space sectors similar to roguelike games, with twenty-some waypoints per sector. The player must \"jump\" the ship between waypoints, normally unaware what awaits at each point, and make headway to an \"exit\" point leading to the next sector until the Federation is reached. The player’s ship accumulates currency, additional crew, equipment, ship enhancements, but also damage to ship and crew, by maximizing the number of waypoints (and hence events/other ships) visited per sector.  The player can revisit waypoints, but each warp jump consumes fuel and causes the rebel fleet to advance in each sector, and slowly take over more of the beacons. Once a beacon is taken over, jumping to the beacon will result in an encounter with a rebel cruiser, and will only ever grant the player one piece of fuel as a reward for defeating the ship. Encounters are more dangerous, and give better rewards, in later sectors of the game.\nThere are eight different races of species in the game. These races can both be acquired by the player, and fought against on an enemy ship. The eight races are Humans, Engi, Zoltan, Mantis, Rock, Slug, Lanius, and Crystal. Each of the races have different strengths and weaknesses based on their physiology. For example, the Rock race are more resistant to damage and fire, but are slower than other races.\n\nWaypoints may include stores that offer ship systems, fuel, ammunition, weapons, drones, crew recruits, and hull repairs for a certain amount of scrap (in-game currency). Other waypoints may appear as distress calls from stranded ships or traps set by rebels or pirates (A ship that has been taken over by a hostile group.). Certain destinations are hazardous to the ship or ship functions: asteroid belts continually pelt ships, nebulae disable sensors, and flares from red giant stars cause fires. Hostile ships often attack the player and must either be destroyed or fought until they offer to surrender, evaded by \"jumping\" away, or destroyed. During battles, the game becomes a real-time space combat simulator in which the player can pause the game for situation evaluation and command input.\nIn combat, the player can manage the ship's systems by distributing power, order crew to specific stations or rooms to repair damage, and fire weapons at the enemy ship. Successful weapon strikes by either side can damage systems, disabling their functions until repaired by crew; cause hull breaches that vent air into space until patched by crew; ignite fires that spread and damage both systems and the hull until they are extinguished by crew or starved of oxygen; and inflict direct hull damage, which reduces the ship's hull points. A ship is destroyed once its hull points are reduced to zero, or defeated once its crew is eliminated. A player victory earns resources for bartering, upgrading, or combat; an enemy victory results in game failure, deleting the save file and forcing the player to start over, creating a high level of difficulty. Alternatively, the player may evade combat by jumping to another waypoint after the ship's engines have fully charged; occasionally hostile ships may likewise escape the player.\nThe game begins with a single available ship, the Kestrel-class cruiser in default “A” configuration. Nine further ships, one for each of seven non-human races and two additional human Federation ships, are unlocked by completing various optional objectives. All ships have two additional layouts (except Crystal and Lanius, with one each) — different color schemes, equipment, and crew — that can be unlocked by completing base-layout objectives. Each ship design and layout begin focus on different game play aspects: the ship roster has designs emphasizing stealth cloaking, boarding, drone systems, and other variations. The game also has separate achievements with no gameplay impact. The game can be modified by the user to alter the various ship configurations.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nFTL is the product of the two-man team of Subset Games, Matthew Davis and Justin Ma. Both were employees of 2K Games's Shanghai studio, and became friends during their tenure there, playing various board games in their free time. Ma, who considered himself a jack-of-all-trades, had become dissatisfied with working in a larger studio, and after traveling to the 2011 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco and seeing the Independent Games Festival, he realized he wanted to become an independent developer. Davis had left 2K Games early in 2011, and after biking through China, returned and joined Ma, who had also recently quit, and began working on the core FTL game. They agreed they would spend a year towards development and if their efforts did not pan out, they would go on to other things. Following the success of the game, the pair began work on their second game, Into the Breach.\nThe idea for FTL was inspired by tabletop board games, such as Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, and non-strategic video games, such as Star Wars: X-Wing, where the player would have to route power to available systems to best manage the situation. Davis also stated that some of the influences for the game from TV shows and movies included Star Trek, Firefly and Star Wars. Unlike most space combat simulation games, \"the initial concept was as simple as wanting to put the player in the commander's chair instead of the pilot's\", according to Davis, and to make \"the player feel like they were Captain Picard yelling at engineers to get the shields back online\", as stated by Ma. The intent of the game was to make it feel like a \"suicide mission\", and had adjusted the various elements of the game to anticipate a 10% success rate. They looked to Super Meat Boy as an example of a game designed \"to be hard, but not frustrating\", according to Ma, noting that there were almost no barriers to the player restarting after a failed attempt; they developed the restarting process for FTL to be similarly easy. However, they also considered that each loss was a learning experience for the player, gaining knowledge of what battles to engage in and when to avoid or abandon unwinnable fights. The permanence of a gameplay mistake was a critical element they wanted to include, and gameplay features such as permadeath emphasized this approach.Their preliminary versions used primitive art assets to allow them to focus on the game. This helped them to realize that they were trying to help the player become invested in the characters they controlled, allowing their imagination to fill in what their graphics at the time could not. Only as they neared the August 2011 Game Developers Conference in China after about six months of work, where they planned to submit FTL as part of the Independent Games Festival there, did they start focusing on the game's art. The game was named as a finalist at the IGF China competition, leading to initial media exposure for the game. PC Gamer magazine offered an early preview of the game that created more media interest in time for the Independent Games Festival at the March 2012 Games Developer Conference. The OnLive cloud-based gaming service included FTL and other Independent Games Festival finalists for several weeks around the conference. At the Festival, FTL was nominated for, though did not win, the Grand Prize and the Excellent in Design award; these accolades further helped spark interest in the game. Davis considered that the game's involvement in these competitions were important to keep the game's development on a forward schedule, as judges and members of the press would be expecting playable prototypes of the completed title. He believed that the publicity of being a part of these competitions, even if not as a nominated title, helped to garner interest in FTL by the larger public.Subset Games had initially planned to work on the title for about a three-month period after saving enough of their own money to cover expenses for about a year. The additional attention to the game forced them to extend development – what would be a two-year process – and thus they turned to Kickstarter in order to fund the final polish of the game as well as costs associated to its release, seeking a total funding goal of $10,000. Their Kickstarter approach was considered well-timed, riding on the coattails of the highly successful Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter in March 2012, as well as gaining the attention of top developers like Ken Levine and Markus Persson; with interest spurred in crowd-funded games, Subset games was able to raise over $200,000 through the effort. FTL represents one of the first games to come out from this surge in crowd-funded games, and demonstrates that such funding mechanisms can support video game development.With the larger funding, Subset considered the benefit of adding more features at the cost of extending the game's release schedule. They opted to make some small improvements on the game, with only a one-month release delay from their planned schedule, and stated they would use the remaining Kickstarter funds for future project development. The additional funds allowed them to pay for licensing fees of middleware libraries and applications to improve the game's performance. Additionally, they were able to outsource other game assets; in particular additional writing and world design was provided by Tom Jubert (Penumbra, Driver: San Francisco), while music was composed by Ben Prunty. Prunty was introduced to Subset through another game developer, Anton Mikhailov, that was a common friend to both Prunty and Davis. Prunty was already ready to provide Subset with some music tracks prior to the Kickstarter, but with its success, they were able to pay for a full soundtrack. Prunty retained the rights to the soundtrack, and since has been able to offer it on Bandcamp. Prunty wanted to create an interactive soundtrack that would change when the player entered and exited battle; for this, he composed the calmer \"Explore\" (non-battle) version of each song, then build atop that to create the more-engaging \"Battle\" version. Within the game, both versions of the song play at the same time, with the game cross-fading between the versions based on action in the game.One of the highest tiers of the Kickstarter campaign allowed a contributor to help design a race for inclusion in the game. One supporter contributed at this level and helped design a secret race, the Crystal.\n\n\n=== FTL: Advanced Edition ===\nIn November 2013, Subset announced that FTL: Advanced Edition was under development, and would add several new events, ships, equipment and other features to the existing game. This version was released on April 3, 2014 as a free update for FTL owners, and as a separate release for iPad devices, with the potential for other mobile systems in the future. Chris Avellone was announced as 'special guest writer' on the project.A new playable race, the Lanius — metallic lifeforms that reduce oxygen levels in any room they are in — was introduced. Additional components added to the game included a clone bay, a counterpart to the medical bay that creates clones of deceased crew with a small penalty against their skills, hacking drones that target specific systems on an enemy ship, a mind control system able to take control of an enemy crew member, a pulsar environmental hazard which periodically disables a ship's systems, and battery systems to give the player a short burst of power at their discretion. Other new features included a new ship and alien race, a third layout for eight of the now ten ships, new weapons, and additional beacon encounters, as well as a new sector.  An additional Hard difficulty mode was also introduced. All of the expansion's content can be disabled within the game if preferred.The team looked at bringing this version to the PlayStation Vita, which also would have supported touch controls, but ultimately believed that the screen size of the system was too limiting for the game.Subset Games has stated that they would not likely create a direct sequel to FTL, though future games they are planning may include similar concepts that were introduced in FTL. It is unlikely that they will use a Kickstarter method to raise funds, as they have raised enough money through sales of FTL to continue to fund their future projects.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nFTL received positive reviews, with praise for the game's captivating nature and means of tapping into the imagination of the players who have envisioned themselves as captains of starships. The game's approach and setting has been compared to science fiction works; Ben Kuchera of Penny Arcade Report called FTL \"Firefly by way of the Rogue-like genre\", while others have compared it to Star Trek and Star Wars.PC Gamer awarded FTL its Short-form Game of the Year 2012 award. The game won both \"Excellence in Design\" and the \"Audience Award\", and was a finalist for the \"Seumas McNally Grand Prize\" awards for the 15th Annual Independent Games Festival. It was also named the \"Best Debut\" title at the 2013 Game Developers Choice Awards. At the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards FTL received the nomination for Game, Strategy (Justin Ma, Matthew Davis) and Game Engineering (Matthew Davis).  Forbes listed both Ma and Davis in its 2013 \"30 Under 30\" leaders in the field of games for the success of FTL.While reception of the game has generally been positive, some reviewers have criticized the game's difficulty level. Sparky Clarkson of GameCritics wrote, \"FTL is an absurdly, cruelly difficult game.\" The staff of Edge magazine, while generally complimentary towards the game, said, \"FTL can occasionally feel punishing\".The iPad version of FTL: Advanced Edition was praised for the intuitive touch controls, fine-tuned to work on the device. This version has received universal acclaim with a Metacritic score of 88/100 based on 17 reviews.FTL, along with indie titles Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac, are considered to be key games that launched the concept of \"roguelike-like\" games that borrow a subset of major features of classical roguelike games but not all; most often, as with FTL, these games use procedural generation along with permadeath atop other gameplay mechanics to create a highly-replayable experience.The game's soundtrack was nominated for IGN's Best Overall Music and Best PC Sound of 2012. It was recognized as being among Kotaku's Best Video Game Music of 2012, one of the Top Ten Video Game Soundtracks of 2012 on The Game Scouts, and one of Complex magazine's 25 Best Video Game Soundtracks on Bandcamp.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
      "FTL: Faster Than Light is a top down, real time strategy game created by indie developers Subset Games. In the game, the player controls the crew of a single spacecraft, holding critical information to be delivered to an allied fleet several sectors away, while being pursued by a large rebel fleet. The player must guide the spacecraft over a number of sectors, each with planetary systems and events procedurally generated in a roguelike fashion, while facing against rebel and other hostile forces, recruiting new crew, and outfitting and upgrading their ship. Combat takes place in pausable real time, and if the ship is destroyed or the crew lost, the game ends in permadeath, requiring the player to restart.The concept for FTL was based on tabletop board games and other non-strategic space combat video games that required the player to manage an array of ship's functions. The initial development by the two-man Subset Games was self-funded, and guided towards developing entries for various indie game competitions. With positive responses from players and judges at these events, Subset opted to engage in a crowd-sourced Kickstarter campaign to finish the title, and succeeded in obtaining twenty times more than they had sought; the extra funds were used towards more professional art, music and in-game writing. The game, considered one of the major successes of the Kickstarter fundraisers for video games, was released in September 2012, to many positive reviews.The player controls a faster-than-light (FTL) travel capable spacecraft belonging to the Federation, which is on the verge of collapse after losing a war with human-supremacist rebel forces. The player's crew intercepts a data packet from the rebel fleet containing information that could throw the rebels into disarray and ensure a Federation victory. The goal is to reach Federation headquarters, waiting several space sectors away, while avoiding destruction or capture by the pursuing rebels.At game start, the player chooses a spacecraft with several specific systems rooms (piloting, engines, weapons, life support, etc.), and a crew. The game randomly generates multiple space sectors à la roguelike games, with twenty-some interesting way-points per sector. The player must \"jump\" the ship between way-points, normally unaware what awaits at each point, making headway to an \"exit\" point leading to the next sector until the Federation is reached. Players can revisit way-points, but each warp jump consumes fuel and causes the rebel fleet to occupy more of the space in each sector. Encounters are more dangerous deeper within the rebel sphere of influence.Way-points may include stores that offer ship systems, fuel, ammunition, crew recruits, and hull repairs for a certain amount of scrap (in-game currency). Other way-points may appear as distress calls from stranded ships or traps set by rebels and other hostile groups. Certain destinations are hazardous to the ship or ship functions: asteroid belts continually pelt ships, nebulae disable sensors, and flares from red giant stars cause fires. Hostile ships often attack the player, and must either be destroyed or fought until they offer surrender. During attacks the game becomes a real-time space combat simulator in which the player can pause the game for situation evaluation and command input.In combat, the player can manage the ship's systems by distributing power, order crew to specific stations or rooms to repair damage, and fire weapons at the enemy ship. Successful weapon strikes by either side can damage systems, disabling their functions until repaired by crew; cause hull breaches that vent air into space until patched by crew; ignite fires that spread and damage both systems and the hull until they are extinguished by crew or starved of oxygen; and inflict direct hull damage, which reduces the ship's hull points (the player can restore hull points via stores, friendly bases, random events, and hull repair drones). A ship is destroyed once its hull points are reduced to zero, or defeated once its crew is eliminated. A player victory earns resources for bartering, upgrading, or combat; an enemy victory results in game failure, deleting the save file and forcing the player to start over creating a high level of difficulty. Alternatively, the player may evade combat by jumping to another way-point after the ship's engines have charged.The game begins with a single accessible ship, the Kestrel-class cruiser. Eight further ships are unlocked by completing objectives. Each ship has a second layout—a different color scheme, equipment, and crew—that can be unlocked by completing base-layout objectives. Each ship design and layout begin focused on different game play aspects; the ship roster has designs for stealth, boarding, drone systems, and other variations. The game also has separate achievements with no gameplay impact.

The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the game's creativity.SynopsisThe player controls a spacecraft capable of traveling faster-than-light (FTL). It belongs to the Galactic Federation, which is on the verge of collapse after losing a war with rebel forces, chiefly human in species. The player's crew intercepts a data packet from the rebel fleet containing information that could throw the rebels into disarray and ensure a Federation victory.

The player can revisit waypoints, but each warp jump consumes fuel and causes the rebel fleet to advance in each sector, and slowly take over more of the beacons. Once a beacon is taken over, jumping to the beacon will result in an encounter with a rebel cruiser, and will only ever grant the player one piece of fuel as a reward for defeating the ship. Encounters are more dangerous deeper within the rebel sphere of influence.There are eight different races of crew in the game. These races can both be acquired by the player, and fought against on an enemy ship. The eight races are: Humans, Engi, Zoltan, Mantis, Rock, Slug, Lanius and Crystal. Each of the races have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, the Rock race are more resistant to damage and fire, but are slower than other races. In addition to this, each race has its own ship which can be unlocked through gameplay.

Prunty was already ready to provide Subset with some music tracks prior to the Kickstarter, but with its success, they were able to pay for a full soundtrack. Prunty retained the rights to the soundtrack, and since has been able to offer it on Bandcamp. Prunty wanted to create an interactive soundtrack that would change when the player entered and exit battle; for this, he composed the calmer «Explore» (non-battle) version of each song, then build atop that to create the more-engaging «Battle» version. Within the game, both versions of the song play at the same time, with the game cross-fading between the versions based on action in the game.

      "By\nTim Stone\n2012-10-09T15:00:00.282ZReviewPolished and involving, FTL spews superb sci-fi adventures like a cornered Mantis boarder spews hot formic acid.The fellow nursing the mug of Roc ale in the corner of the cantina doesn't have to tell you he's an FTL captain. The laser burns on his jacket, the monkey wrench in his belt, and the broad grin creasing his craggy, careworn face give him away.Sit down opposite him and you invite a torrent of torrid tales.“See this scar? I got that when I targeted my own bridge with an incendiary missile. Had some Mantis boarders running amok – it was the only way to take them down.“Buy me a pint and I'll tell you about the time my ship, the Belle Guano, tangled with a pirate cutter twice its size near the Slug homeworld. Trust me, you don't know fear until you've had to shut down your own shields, life-support system, and sensors in order to summon the power necessary to launch an anti-ship drone.”Every one of FTL's evening-sized odysseys bulges at the bulkheads with dramatic dogfights, tough trading decisions and bittersweet twists of fate. If you've ever yearned for a randomness-heavy 2D Firefly game – a top-down Star Trek or Blake's Seven turn-based strategy game – then yearn no longer.Adventures begin with ship selection. Initially there's just one vessel type available. Completing enigmatic quests widens the choice on subsequent playthroughs.Whatever craft you're captaining, the ultimate objective is always the same: deliver a vitally important message to the Federation fleet by battling, trading, and upgrading your way through a randomly generated web of sectors. Every sector is its own navigable web of unscripted surprises.Because a powerful rebel armada is always hot on your heels, you can't linger in any sector indefinitely. Speed is of the essence, but so too is scrap – FTL's precious currency. Knowing that resistance stiffens the closer he gets to his goal, the sensible skipper loiters for as long as possible in order to maul and recycle the maximum enemies.It's rare that a turn passes without a hard choice or a satisfying skirmish. One minute you're looking on as your lasers and missiles steadily savage the systems and unstitch the hull of an outfought/out-thought foe, the next you're deciding whether to intervene in an intergalactic mugging, rescue a mad castaway, or send crew to investigate an eerie space hulk. Pauseable combat and multiple-choice event texts mean there's always limitless time for mulling over options.There are hundreds of possible encounters, and countless ways of improving your ship. Bad luck and poor decisions regularly lead to heartbreaking setbacks and sacrifices. So far I've refused to hand over any crew to bullying slavers, but have on several occasions had to sell indispensable kit in order to finance essential repairs or fill an empty tank. Running out of fuel is one of the game's scariest situations. You're forced to drift forlorn and regret-wracked waiting for either a good Samaritan or a rebel coup-de-grace.FTL feels like a project that's been thoughtfully tweaked over several years. Features work hard and are well meshed. Texts are trim and nicely phrased. Even Ben Prunty's twinkling soundtrack fits beautifully. Scanning the game's impressive superstructure for vulnerable exhaust ports and shot traps, just about the only weakpoints I've managed to identify are the lack of personnel histories, and the painfully slow rate of vessel unlocks. A few lines illuminating the backgrounds of new crewmen, and some more generous blueprint dispensing would nudge this unmissable sci-fi story generator even closer to perfection.Expect to pay: £7 / $11 Release Out: now Developer: Subset Games Publisher: Steam Multiplayer: None Link: www.ftlgame.comPolished and involving, FTL spews superb sci-fi adventures like a cornered Mantis boarder spews hot formic acid.Subscribe to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

      "Free Download Game for PCFTL Faster Than Light Free Download for PC is a top-down roguelike space ship simulator created by indie developer Subset Games, which was first released for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in September 2012. In the game, the player controls the crew of a single spacecraft, holding critical information to be delivered to an allied fleet eight sectors away, while being pursued by a large rebel fleet. The player must guide the spacecraft over eight sectors, each with planetary systems and events procedurally generated in a roguelike fashion, while facing rebel and other hostile forces, recruiting new crew, and outfitting and upgrading their ship. Combat takes place in pausable real time, and if the ship is destroyed or all of its crew lost, the game ends, requiring the player to restart with a new ship.The concept for FTL was based on tabletop board games and other non-strategic space combat video games that required the player to manage an array of ship's functions. The initial development by the two-man Subset Games was self-funded, and guided towards developing entries for various indie game competitions. With positive responses from the players and judges at these events, Subset opted to engage in a crowd-sourced Kickstarter campaign to finish the title, and succeeded in obtaining twenty times more than they had sought; the extra funds were used towards more professional art, music and in-game writing. FTL Faster Than Light Download free Full Version.« View full review »SynopsisThe player controls a spacecraft capable of traveling faster-than-light (FTL). It belongs to the Galactic Federation, which is on the verge of collapse after losing a war with rebel forces, chiefly human in species. The player's crew intercepts a data packet from the rebel fleet containing information that could throw the rebels into disarray and ensure a Federation victory. The goal is to reach Federation headquarters, waiting several space sectors away, while avoiding destruction or capture by the pursuing rebels.GameplayAt game start, the player chooses a spacecraft with several specific systems rooms (piloting, engines, weapons, life support, etc.), and a crew. The game randomly generates eight space sectors similar to roguelike games, with twenty-some interesting waypoints per sector. The player must «jump» the ship between waypoints, normally unaware what awaits at each point, and make headway to an «exit» point leading to the next sector until the Federation is reached. The player can revisit waypoints, but each warp jump consumes fuel and causes the rebel fleet to advance in each sector, and slowly take over more of the beacons. Once a beacon is taken over, jumping to the beacon will result in an encounter with a rebel cruiser, and will only ever grant the player one piece of fuel as a reward for defeating the ship. Encounters are more dangerous deeper within the rebel sphere of influence.There are eight different races of crew in the game. These races can both be acquired by the player, and fought against on an enemy ship. The eight races are: Humans, Engi, Zoltan, Mantis, Rock, Slug, Lanius and Crystal. Each of the races have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, the Rock race are more resistant to damage and fire, but are slower than other races. In addition to this, each race has its own ship which can be unlocked through gameplay. FTL Faster Than Light Game free Download Full Version.Waypoints may include stores that offer ship systems, fuel, ammunition, weapons, drones, crew recruits, and hull repairs for a certain amount of scrap (in-game currency). Other waypoints may appear as distress calls from stranded ships or traps set by rebels and other hostile groups. Certain destinations are hazardous to the ship or ship functions: asteroid belts continually pelt ships, nebulae disable sensors, and flares from red giant stars cause fires. Hostile ships often attack the player, and must either be destroyed or fought until they offer surrender, or evaded by «jumping» away. During attacks the game becomes a real-time space combat simulator in which the player can pause the game for situation evaluation and command input.In combat, the player can manage the ship's systems by distributing power, order crew to specific stations or rooms to repair damage, and fire weapons at the enemy ship. Successful weapon strikes by either side can damage systems, disabling their functions until repaired by crew; cause hull breaches that vent air into space until patched by crew; ignite fires that spread and damage both systems and the hull until they are extinguished by crew or starved of oxygen; and inflict direct hull damage, which reduces the ship's hull points (the player can restore hull points via stores, friendly bases, random events, and hull repair drones). A ship is destroyed once its hull points are reduced to zero, or defeated once its crew is eliminated. A player victory earns resources for bartering, upgrading, or combat; an enemy victory results in game failure, deleting the save file and forcing the player to start over creating a high level of difficulty. Alternatively, the player may evade combat by jumping to another waypoint after the ship's engines have charged.The game begins with a single accessible ship, the Kestrel-class cruiser. Eight further ships are unlocked by completing objectives. All ships except for two have a second and a third layout—different color schemes, equipment, and crew—that can be unlocked by completing base-layout objectives. Each ship design and layout begin focused on different game play aspects; the ship roster has designs for stealth, boarding, drone systems, and other variations. The game also has separate achievements with no gameplay impact. The game can be modified by the user to alter the various ship configurations. FTL Faster Than Light game free Download for PC Full Version.DevelopmentFTL is the product of the two-man team of Subset Games, Matthew Davis and Justin Ma. Both were employees of 2K Games's Shanghai studio, and became friends during their tenure there, playing various board games in their free time. Ma, who considered himself a jack-of-all-trades, had become dissatisfied with working in a larger studio, and after traveling to the 2011 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco and seeing the Independent Games Festival, he realized he wanted to become an independent developer. Davis had left 2K Games early in 2011, and after biking through China, returned and joined Ma, who had also recently quit, and began working on the core FTL game. They agreed they would spend a year towards development and if their efforts did not pan out, they would go on to other things.The idea for the game was inspired by tabletop board games, such as Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, and non-strategic video games, such as Star Wars: X-Wing, where the player would have to route power to available systems to best manage the situation. Davis also stated that some of the influences for the game from TV shows and movies included Star Trek, Firefly and Star Wars. Unlike most space combat simulation games, «the initial concept was as simple as wanting to put the player in the commander's chair instead of the pilot's», according to Davis, and to make «the player feel like they were Captain Picard yelling at engineers to get the shields back online», as stated by Ma. The intent of the game was to make it feel like a «suicide mission», and had adjusted the various elements of the game to anticipate a 10% success rate. They looked to Super Meat Boy as an example of a game designed «to be hard, but not frustrating», according to Ma, noting that there were almost no barriers to the player restarting after a failed attempt; they developed the restarting process for FTL to be similarly easy. However, they also considered that each loss was a learning experience for the player, gaining knowledge of what battles to engage in and when to avoid or abandon unwinnable fights. The permanence of a gameplay mistake was a critical element they wanted to include, and gameplay features such as permadeath emphasized this approach.Their preliminary versions used primitive art assets to allow them to focus on the game. This helped them to realize that they were trying to help the player become invested in the characters they controlled, allowing their imagination to fill in what their graphics at the time could not. Only as they neared the August 2011 Game Developers Conference in China after about six months of work, where they planned to submit FTL as part of the Independent Games Festival there, did they start focusing on the game's art. The game was named as a finalist at the IGF China competition, leading to initial media exposure for the game. PC Gamer magazine offered an early preview of the game that created more media interest in time for the Independent Games Festival at the March 2012 Games Developer Conference. The OnLive cloud-based gaming service included FTL and other Independent Games Festival finalists for several weeks around the conference. At the Festival, FTL was nominated for, though did not win, the Grand Prize and the Excellent in Design award; these accolades further helped to spark interest in the game. Davis considered that the game's involvement in these competitions were important to keep the game's development on a forward schedule, as judges and members of the press would be expecting playable prototypes of the completed title. Davis believed that the publicity of being a part of these competitions, even if not as a nominated title, helped to garner interest in FTL by the larger public.Subset Games had initially planned to work on the title for about a three-month period after saving enough of their own money to cover expenses for about a year. The additional attention to the game forced them to extend development — what would be a two-year process — and thus they turned to Kickstarter in order to fund the final polish of the game as well as costs associated to its release, seeking a total funding goal of $10,000. Their Kickstarter approach was considered well-timed, riding on the coattails of the highly successful Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter in March 2012, as well as gaining the attention of top developers like Ken Levine and Markus Persson; with interest spurred in crowd-funded games, Subset games was able to raise over $200,000 through the effort. FTL represents one of the first games to come out from this surge in crowd-funded games, and demonstrates that such funding mechanisms can support video game development.(1 votes, average: 4.00 out of 5)Official Name:FTL Faster Than Light Download PCRelease date(s):2014Genre(s):Strategy, roguelike-likePlatform(s):PC, WindowsDeveloper(s):Subset GamesVersion:Full VersionFile Upload:Torrent",

      "The founder of up-and-coming review aggregator OpenCritic has accused rivals Metacritic of using the site’s data without permission.I wonder what scores our list of upcoming PC games will average out at.In a press release sent out today, founderMatthew Enthoven said, “We didn’t know if we should be proud or outraged when we took a look at Metacritic this morning and saw that they had OpenCritic’s review data and information on their site.“On the positive side, we were excited to see another industry giant stand alongside companies such as Insomniac Games, Nvidia and Telltale in presenting OpenCritic as an authority. However, we’re frustrated that we did not receive recognition and have requested that they either credit OpenCritic or begin licensing our API and databases.”Basically, OpenCritic seem to have found a way to more efficiently grab the review data to fill up the site once an embargo lifts. According to Enthoven, Metacritic are just swiping at least some of this data from them, rather than sourcing it from the outlets themselves, without crediting them.“If you can’t see how they copied us, we wouldn’t blame you – we make subtle, near-invisible changes to various review data to tag it using a system we call ‘horsemen’, Enthoven explained. “For example, with PCGamer’s Blood and Wine review, we added a redundant slash after pcgamer.com. With Twinfinite’s review, we capitalized the “W” and “B” in the review URL.“We can’t detail every example as it would give away our tells, but these two are notable: Metacritic’s Blood and Wine page currently has these exact horsemen listed, leading us to believe that they’ve begun sourcing reviews from OpenCritic. These changes don’t interfere with the user experience and are unique to OpenCritic. We checked to make sure that these links did not appear on popular websites such as Neogaf and reddit. We also feel confident in claiming that we listed these URLs first. As with most games, OpenCritic was faster: in this case, three hours faster.”The ‘horsemen’ were built into the system to protect the site’s work, in the same way old cartographers would add fake place to maps and phone books would leave in fake numbers – it’s like a fingerprint for their work, basically.I really like OpenCritic’s setup, as it doesn’t alter scores because they’re not on the /10 scale and it actually credits the critics, going as far as having a page for each one. Mine even has my face on it, it’s great.As Enthoven puts it: “We’re the only aggregator that correctly credits authors in addition to publications. We’re the only aggregator that lets users pick-and-choose their trusted publications. And unlike Metacritic, all of our scores are presented as simple averages with no hidden weightings, using data that can be verified by the public.“As we announced last January, our API alpha is in full swing and will soon shift into beta. We hope that Metacritic and others will consider joining our beta and licensing our API.”I emailed Enthoven to see what the company plans to do about the current situation, to which he responded: “We don’t intend to proceed beyond this statement and the letter that we’ve sent to [Metacritic owners] CBS Interactive. The legal precedents are not in our favor, nor would we want to engage in any legal proceedings. We can think of no faster way to drain funds and lose momentum.“Our intent here was to send a strong message to Metacritic that we are a serious competitor and that we will continue to call them out on practices that don’t advance the industry overall, including sourcing from us without credit.”ShareClicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.PromotedHow to master Monster Hunter: World’s deep combat system7 reasons you should return to RuneScape and Old School RuneScapeWhy a visit to Monster Hunter: World should be your videogame summer vacation",
      "Indie game news, reviews, previews & developer interviewsadvertisementIn FTL you experience the atmosphere of running a spaceship trying to save the galaxy. It’s a dangerous mission, with every encounter presenting a unique challenge with multiple solutions. What will you do if a heavy missile barrage shuts down your shields? Reroute all power to the engines in an attempt to escape, power up additional weapons to blow your enemy out of the sky, or take the fight to them with a boarding party? This “spaceship simulation roguelike-like” allows you to take your ship and crew on an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy filled with glory and bitter defeat.FTL: Faster Than Light is one of those rare pleasures – a game that is difficult to compare to any other. Much of its gameplay is strategy, yet many would call it an adventure on an interstellar level. It calls itself a spaceship simulation and a roguelike and of those labels the former does the best job of properly conveying the feel of FTL; it is a game that aims to give the player that starship captain experience that, to my knowledge at least, doesn’t exist in quite this form anywhere else.Perhaps this is why it raised its funding through an extremely successful Kickstarter campaign (raising over twenty times its original pledge) and why the buzz has not subsided ever since.FTL opens by letting you choose a vessel before naming it and your first three crewmembers. At first only one ship is available but as you achieve certain goals more are unlocked for you to use on your next playthrough. Having readied your ship and named your sturdy crew you are dropped into deep space with an objective – get back to Federation space before the Rebel fleet catches you.The main screen of the game presents you with the layout of your ship and an information display showing key data such as installed weapons and power distribution across different systems.These systems include engines, shields, weapons, life support and the medbay, all of which need a steady supply of power to keep running. Your reactor puts out a certain amount of power bars and you can spread these across your systems as you see fit. This makes for some wonderful moments later on as you reroute power to weapons for that extra punch, leaving the oxygen percentage plummeting towards zero. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves…The game moves forward at your pace, providing a pause function so that you can assess situations and make decisions at a leisurely speed. You’re given a map of the sector that your ship is currently occupying, showing a collection of points to which you can travel by jumping from location to location. Each jump uses up one fuel unit and each location could be anything from a civilised financial transaction to a brutal attack by slave traders.When you reach the far side of a sector you can jump to the next sector, bringing up a large scale map that shows the web like path through the game to your goal. At the end of each sector you can choose which of the next two available areas you’d like to jump to. Meanwhile the Rebel fleet is only ever a few jumps behind you, forcing your journey onwards. The sectors and their contents are all randomised for each playthrough, keeping things reasonably fresh.The sheer number of events that your ship can stumble into is impressive. From disease-ridden space stations to lost ships looking for a guide home, there are plenty of text-based decisions to deal with. Battles are by far the most common kind of trouble you’ll face, however, and they are almost as diverse as the text based challenges. The game comes with a wide variety of enemy ship types and a similarly diverse set of reasons for them to attack you.Battles play out slowly at first, with weapons taking time to power up a shot and shields being able to hold off a set amount of hits before a short recharge. The tactics of these engagements feel like they’ve come straight out of a sci-fi series. You can target any system on your opponent’s ship and they can do the same. Do you focus all your fire on enemy weapons to minimise damage to your ship or do you take down their shield generator for a quicker victory?Little decisions like this make every battle feel like an intense duel of wits. It’s also immensely satisfying to try out different ideas; knock out life support and wait for them to suffocate or beam over your crew to kill them the old fashioned way- there are countless possibilities.Of course, FTL is pretty unforgiving and most of the time you’ll be the one on the receiving end of these strategies. I still hold the bitter memory of a fight where I opened my airlocks to flush out a fire only to have an enemy boarding party take out my door controls. I repelled the boarders and destroyed their ship but with the doors offline I couldn’t stop my precious oxygen from gushing out of the airlock. My crew perished, but at least they did so knowing they’d made the enemy pay.The above story is just one of many. Perhaps the defining feature of FTL is that there are no take-backs. If your ship is destroyed or your crew die it’s game over and back to the drawing board. A game will last anywhere between ten minutes and a couple hours depending on how careful you are and how cruel the universe is feeling. I’ve had games where my ship was half on fire by the end of the second jump and I’ve played others where I’ve managed to crawl through several sectors.Your decisions at stores and while upgrading your ship are almost as important as those you make in combat. You can spend scrap on upgrades to any of your systems or save up for new weapons and all important fuel. Weapons a suitably varied from lasers that cut a swathe across enemy ships to missiles that bypass shields.Adding to this variety of strategy is the possibility of unlocking alternative ships and room layouts. Different ships offer wildly changing strategies from the outset of your game. The Engi Cruiser, for example, only comes with an ion weapon for disabling enemy systems and an attack drone for damage output. This forces you to rely on your drone to destroy the enemy while you use your ion blast to keep their weapons and shields offline.FTL isn’t without drawbacks. It’s a shame, for example, that you can only unlock set ship layouts. It would be great to see a ship designing feature included in a future update, allowing you to organise the rooms on your ship, hire crewmembers and buy starting weapons based on a budget.That said, there are enough ship designs available to keep things entertaining for a long time, especially given the difficulty of actually unlocking them. It’s also a shame that the post game statistics are not more detailed given the interesting stories that can emerge during a playthrough. It would be great to have a captain’s log of the key events in each of your journeys.FTL: Faster Than Light is a superb idea that has been forged into an excellent game. The music and visual design are of a high quality, carrying both atmosphere and information elegantly. Each game feels like its own adventure and it only takes a few jumps for you to become invested in the survival of your crew. FTL is easy to recommend; if you have even the slightest interest in strategic starship management or permadeath adventure then this game has a lot to offer.Rating:advertisementView previous campaigns.Powered by MailChimpadvertisementLast Post:Next Post:This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

      "FTL: Faster Than Light is a space flight simulator game incorporating elements of roguelike games, developed by Subset Games. In the game, the player controls a single space craft, attempting to deliver critical information to its allies across several sectors of space while avoiding rebel forces that seek the information for themselves and other hostile entities. As the player continues across the region of space, they gain equipment and currency to improve their ship's offenses, defenses, and sub-systems, expand the ship's capabilities, or additional crew members to boost the performance of the ship. Combat and repair is done in real-time, though the player can pause the game to assess the situation and issue orders; the game otherwise features permadeath scenarios, randomly generating new challenges each time a new game is started.FTL was announced on February 27, 2012 via Kickstarter and released in September 14, 2012 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.[1]FTL is a space flight simulator game, where the player controls a spacecraft whose crew has intercepted a data packet from a rebel fleet. The goal is to reach a Federation fleet, waiting several sectors of space away, without being destroyed or caught by the rebel fleet that is in pursuit. The game, though sometimes called a roguelike, only incorporates some elements of this genre, as described by its creators, \"mostly just as a representation for some of the main thematic elements of the genre\".[2]At the start of each game, the player chooses a spacecraft which houses a number of rooms devoted to specific systems, like piloting, engines, weapons, and life support, as well as a crew. The game then randomly generates a series of sectors ala roguelike games, each sector containing about twenty-some waypoints of interest. The player must direct the ship to warp between these points, normally unaware of what to expect at each point, making their way to a specific \"exit\" point to move onto the next sector until they reach the Federation.  Players can revisit waypoints, but each warp jump consumes fuel and causes the rebel fleet to occupy more of the space in each sector. Encounters become more dangerous the deeper they occur within the rebels' sphere of influence.Waypoints may include stores where the player can upgrade the ship's systems, purchase fuel and ammunition, and recruit new crewmembers using in-game currency. Other waypoints may appear as calls of distress, either from stranded ships needing help or traps set by the rebels or other hostile groups. Certain destinations may be hazardous to the ship or disable certain functions, such as asteroid belts that continually cause damage to the ship while the craft remains within it, or nebula that disables sensor systems. Often, the player will encounter an unfriendly ship that engages in combat. Here the game becomes a real-time space combat simulator, though the player can pause the game to evaluate the situation. During combat, the player must manage which ship's systems to activate considering the power draw on the ship, ordering the crew to specific stations or rooms to repair damage, and targeting and firing of weapons on the enemy. Damage to the ship can include failure of specific systems until a crewman repairs them, hull breaches that leak air to space, fires that can be either put out by the crew or by starving the fire of air, and general damage to the hull which can only be repaired at stores and other specific locations. The game ends if the hull fails and the ship is destroyed or all of the crew members die. The game uses permadeath in that although the player can save games between playing sessions, the save game is immediately overwritten upon relaunch, preventing the player from restarting a game from a previous saved game. The player is successful in combat either by destroying the enemy ship, eliminating the enemy crew or damaging enough to cause the ship to surrender; this provides resources that the player can use in bartering, upgrading, or combat. Alternatively, the player can wait for their ship's engine to charge to jump to another waypoint and escape battle.The game begins with a single unlocked hull, with eight further hulls unlockable by completing various objectives. Each hull has a second unlockable layout with a different colour scheme, beginning equipment, and starting crew, unlocked by completing objectives specific to the base hull. Each individual hull and layout tends to begin focused on different aspects of gameplay, with the roster including ships designed for stealth, boarding, drone systems, and other variations. The game also features a separate list of achievements with no impact on gameplay.FTL is the product of the two-man team of Subset Games, Matthew Davis and Justin Ma. Both were employees of 2K Games's Shanghai studio. Davis had left 2K Games early in 2011, and after biking through China, returned and joined Ma, who had also recently quit, and began working on the core FTL game.[3] The idea for the game was inspired by tabletop board games and non-stragetic video games, such as Star Wars: X-Wing, where the player would have to route power to available systems to best manage the situation.[3]Their preliminary versions used primitive art assets to allow them to focus on the game; only as they neared the August 2011 Game Developers Conference in China, where they planned to submit FTL as part of the Independent Games Festival there, did they start focusing on the game's art.[3] The game was named as a finalist at the IGF China competition, leading to initial media exposure for the game.[4] PC Gamer magazine offered an early preview of the game that created more media interest in time for the Independent Games Festival at the March 2012 Games Developer Conference.[5] The OnLive cloud-based gaming service included FTL and other Independent Games Festival finalists for several weeks around the conference.[6][7] At the Festival, FTL was nominated for, though did not win, the Grand Prize and the Excellent in Design award; these accolades further helped to spark interest in the game.[4]Although much of the game was initially self funded, Subset Games turned to Kickstarter in order to fund the final polish of the game as well as costs associated to its release, seeking a total funding goal of $10,000.[1] Their Kickstarter approach was considered well-timed, riding on the coattails of the highly-successful Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter in March 2012;[8] with interest spurred in crowd-funded games, Subset games was able to raise over $200,000 through the effort.[1] FTL represents one of the first games to come out from this surge in crowd-funded games, and demonstrates that such funding mechanisms can support video game development.[8]With the larger funders, Subset was able to outsource other game assets; in particular for music composed by Ben Prunty.[9] Prunty was introduced to Subset through another game developer, Anton Mikhailov, that was a common friend to both Prunty and Davis. Prunty was already ready to provide Subset with some music tracks prior to the Kickstarter, but with its success, they were able to pay for a full soundtrack. Prunty retained the rights to the soundtrack, and since has been able to offer it on Bandcamp.[9]  Prunty wanted to create an interactive soundtrack that would change when the player entered and exit battle; for this, he composed the calmer \"Explore\" (non-battle) version of each song, then build atop that to create the more-engaging \"Battle\" version. Within the game, both versions of the song play at the same time, with the game cross-fading between the versions based on action in the game.[9]FTL received positive reviews from journalists on its release, with praise for the game's captivating nature and means of tapping into the imagination of players who have envisioned themselves as captains of starships. The game's approach and setting has been compared to science fiction works; Ben Kuchera of Penny Arcade Report calls FTL \"Firefly by way of the Rogue-like genre\",[16] while others have compared it to Star Trek, Star Wars, and Battlestar Galactica.[12]250pxDeveloper(s)Subset GamesPlatform(s)Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, LinuxRelease date(s)September 14, 2012GenreSpace flight simulation roguelikeMode(s)Single-playerMediaDigital distributionGameRankings84.85%[10]Metacritic83/100[11]Eurogamer8/10[12]GameSpot8/10[13]GameSpy[14]IGN8/10[15]This article uses material from the Wikipedia article FTL: Faster Than Light, that was deleted or is being discussed for deletion, which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.\n\n\n Author(s): Longbyte1\n Search for \"FTL: Faster Than Light\" on GoogleView Wikipedia's deletion log of \"FTL: Faster Than Light\"Author(s): Longbyte1Search for \"FTL: Faster Than Light\" on GoogleView Wikipedia's deletion log of \"FTL: Faster Than Light\"",
      "FTL: Faster Than Light is likely one of the biggest indie hits of the year, and stands as more evidence that Kickstarter is a system which simply ‘works’ for indie projects. The game is the first roguelike title to reach major success since The Binding of Isaac, and hopefully will inspire more like-minded games and studios. Faster Than Light puts players in the position of a ship’s captain attempting to escape a rebel fleet and return to the last stand of the Federation – fighting past rebels, pirates and hostile species while trying to shape up for the final fight – yet fast enough to avoid detection by the rebel fleet.If it sounds a little hectic, that’s because it is – but in everything it does, FTL delivers well-balanced and truly entertaining gameplay. Players will feel true panic when their systems are being overloaded and the oxygen room takes a hit whilst their crew is simultaneously running around for repairs and fighting off enemies who’ve boarded the vessel. The action can get hectic, but it never stops truly being fun.Players will find themselves trying to micromanage their crew, weapons and subsystems in parallel as each and every battle could be their last. Once your ship explodes, it’s game over – there’s no going back. Each playthrough is certainly a learning experience, giving the player more pieces of information (and unlockable ships) to work with to try and make it further next time.The player must traverse through eight sectors to reach The Last Stand location and fight the final boss. Players are forced to run from an ever-advancing rebel fleet after each FTL jump, which insures the game is always played at a certain speed, somewhat rushing the player to the ending before they can fully upgrade their ships. The game randomizes the type of each sector f0r each playthrough, which can help or hinder each individual game. Hostile territories present plenty of enemy presence, but also the opportunity for greater salvage. Civilian and friendly areas present the opportunity to find weapons without as much constant fighting. The third type – mysterious unexplored nebulas – slow down the Rebel Fleet from following you, but bring out massive ion storms and limited visibility during combat.Players will have to micromanage their crew as areas become damaged.Combat is rife with challenging micromanagement, as crewmembers of each species are fitted for different tasks. Mantis are exceptional fighters but slow to repair, whilst Engis repair twice as fast, but deal out half the damage when in combat. Finding the right balance for each playstyle will be important, and often discovered through a trial by fire process. Regardless of what species your crew is, it’s usually a good idea to get as many as possible – you never know when enemies will board, or who you might lose during a text-based choice event, which offer bonus rewards but may also earn you some hull damage or the death of a crew member for taking chances.There are a four types of weaponry: missiles, lasers, beams, and bombs. Each have their own advantages (missiles go through shields, lasers don’t require ammo, beams hit more than one room, and bombs simply explode a lot). Finding what combinations work best – and exploiting the ones which do – is one of the most entertaining parts of the game. There’s no better feeling than taking down an enemy ship before they even have a chance to breach your shields – though FTL will likely knock you down a peg when you’re feeling invincible.The only thing the game truly lacks is full-featured content. What it has included in the game is well-balanced and performs to near perfection, but there’s just not enough to satisfy players who want to thoroughly explore the game. With a limit of eight sectors featuring six regular races, players are left to experiment with only a few weaponry combinations in their limited runs. However, fans will likely still enjoy returning to the game, despite the lack of content, which is a testament to the addictive and challenging environment the title provides.If you like micromanaging and space, FTL is worth the $10 price tag but is limited by a lack of variance in enemies and options. More content would help round out the package but, even as it stands, FTL is still a good title with addictive gameplay. Should you try it out? Absolutely.–FTL: Faster Than Light is available now for Mac and PC.Follow me on Twitter @Makelevi.",

We wanted that experience, as opposed to the “dog fighting in space” that most videogames focus on.

    "title": "Diablo III",
    "text": [
      "Diablo III is a dungeon crawler action role-playing video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. It is the third installment in the Diablo franchise and was released on May 15, 2012 for Microsoft Windows and macOS. A console version was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on September 3, 2013. Versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released on August 19, 2014.In the game, players choose one of seven character classes – Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, Witch Doctor or Wizard (with the Crusader being unavailable unless the player has purchased the expansion pack, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and the Necromancer added later as separate online purchase) – and are tasked with defeating the Lord of Terror, Diablo.\nDiablo III set a new record for fastest-selling PC game selling over 3.5 million copies in the first 24 hours of its release, and was the best selling PC game of 2012, selling over 12 million copies during the year. It has sold, along with Reaper of Souls, 30 million copies across all platforms. Diablo III received critical acclaim from critics, although its digital rights management that requires an internet connection at all times was criticized.The expansion pack Diablo III: Reaper of Souls was released for the Windows and macOS editions of the game on March 25, 2014. For consoles the expansion pack content was released as part of the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition version. It was released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on August 19, 2014. Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition includes the original console version of Diablo III and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls expansion pack. The second expansion Diablo III: Rise of the Necromancer was released for the Windows, macOS, and latest-generation console editions of the game on June 27, 2017.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nMuch like in Diablo and Diablo II, the quality and attributes of equipment are randomized. In addition to base stats (such as damage and attack speed for weapon or armor points on armor), higher-quality items have additional properties, such as extra damage, attribute bonuses, bonuses to critical hit chance or sockets (which allow items to be upgraded and customized by adding gems for various stat bonuses). Magic-quality items have 1 to 3 random properties, rare-quality items have 4 to 6 random properties and legendary-quality items typically have 6 to 8 properties with varying degrees of randomness (for example, the Mempo of Twilight, a legendary helm, always has a socket, bonuses to elemental resistance, attack speed and life, a bonus to either Intelligence, Dexterity or Strength, and one additional random property, however the magnitude of these bonuses varies from item to item), and set items are a subtype of legendary items which provide additional, cumulative bonuses if multiple items from the same set are simultaneously equipped. Higher level monsters tend to drop higher level items, which tend to have higher base stats and bonuses.\n\nThe proprietary engine incorporates Blizzard's custom in-house physics, and features destructible environments with an in-game damage effect. The developers sought to make the game run on a wide range of systems without requiring DirectX 10. Diablo III uses a custom 3D game engine in order to present an overhead view to the player, in a somewhat similar way to the isometric view used in previous games in the series. Enemies utilize the 3D environment as well, in ways such as crawling up the side of a wall from below into the combat area.As in Diablo II, multiplayer games are possible using Blizzard's Battle.net service, with many of the new features developed for StarCraft II also available in Diablo III. Players are also able to drop in and out of sessions of co-operative play with other players. Unlike its predecessor, Diablo III requires players to be connected to the internet constantly due to their DRM policy, even for single-player games.An enhanced quest system, a random level generator, and a random encounter generator are used in order to ensure the game provides different experiences when replayed.Unlike previous iterations, gold can be picked up merely by touching it, or coming within range, adjusted by gear, rather than having to manually pick it up. One of the new features intended to speed gameplay is that health orbs drop from enemies, replacing the need to have a potion bar, which itself is replaced by a skill bar that allows a player to assign quick bar buttons to skills and spells; previously, players could only assign two skills (one for each mouse button) and had to swap skills with the keyboard or mousewheel. Players can still assign specific attacks to mouse buttons.Skill runes, another new feature, are skill modifiers that are unlocked as the player levels up. Unlike the socketable runes in Diablo II, skill runes are not items but instead provide options for enhancing skills, often completely changing the gameplay of each skill. For example, one skill rune for the Wizard's meteor ability reduces its arcane power cost, while another turns the meteor to ice, causing cold damage rather than fire.\n\n\n=== Hardcore mode ===\nAs in Diablo II, Diablo III gives players the choice to make hardcore characters.  Players are required to first level up a regular character to level 10 before they have the option to create new Hardcore characters. Hardcore characters cannot be resurrected; instead they become permanently unplayable if they are killed. Hardcore characters are separately ranked, and they can only form teams with other hardcore characters. After dying, the ghost of a hardcore character can still chat. Their name still shows up in rankings, but the character cannot return to the game. If the hardcore character reached level 10 before dying, it can be placed in the Hall of Fallen Heroes.\n\n\n=== Artisans ===\nArtisans are non-player characters (NPCs) who sell and craft. Two types of artisans can be introduced by completing a quest for each: Haedrig Eamon the Blacksmith and Covetous Shen the Jeweler. The Reaper of Souls expansion introduced the Mystic artisan, who can replace individual item enchantments and change the physical appearance of items. Artisans create items using materials the player can gather by scrapping acquired items and reducing them to their component parts. These materials are used to create items which will have random bonuses. Unlike Diablo II, rare and magic items can be enhanced, not just basic weaponry and armor. Crafting can also be used to train and improve the skills of the artisans rather than create new items. When artisans gain new levels, their shop reflects their higher skill level. The process of salvaging items into materials also makes inventory management easier. Blizzard stated that this crafting system was designed so that it would not slow down the pace of the game.\n\n\n=== Followers ===\nFollowers are NPC allies that can accompany the player throughout the game world. There are three followers in Diablo III: Kormac the Templar, Lyndon the Scoundrel and Eirena the Enchantress, who each possess their own skills and background. As followers fight alongside the player, they gain new experience, skills, and equipment as they level up. Only one follower accompanies the player at a time, creating a gameplay strategy decision. Originally, followers were only going to appear in Normal mode; however, Jay Wilson stated at BlizzCon 2011 that followers would continue to be usable in later difficulty levels. Followers do not appear in co-op games nor against Diablo, as he will trap them in a cage of metal bones.\n\n\n=== Auction house ===\nOn August 1, 2011, it was reported that Diablo III would feature two types of auction houses; one where players spend in-game gold and another where players could buy or sell virtual items for real-world money.  The real-money auction house was not available in Hardcore mode.Prior to release, Blizzard stated that nearly everything that drops on the ground, including gold, could be traded with other players either directly or through the auction house system. Aside from certain bound on account items, such as the Staff of Herding needed to access the Whimsyshire easter egg, Blizzard stated there would be very few items that would be bound to a particular character and therefore un-tradable.In order to get rated in South Korea, Blizzard had to remove the real-money auction house from the Korean release of the game as the auction house violated Korean anti-gambling laws.In the gold-based auction house, a flat fee of 15 percent was taken from the final sale price of an auction. The real-money auction house fees were US$1, €1 or £1 (or equivalent) for equipment (weapons and armor) and 15 percent fee for commodity auctions, which included items like crafting materials, blacksmith and jewelcrafting plans, and gold exchange. There was an additional 15 percent \"cashing-out\" fee from proceeds gained selling items in the real-money auction house.While the gold-based auction house was available to any player regardless of which region they play in, the real-money auction was restricted to players on their home region. If they used the global play function to play in a different region, they would not be able to access the real-money auction house. The real money auction house was opened on June 12, 2012 (June 15 in the Americas).\nIn March 2013, former Diablo III game director Jay Wilson stated that he felt the existence of the auction houses \"really hurt\" the game. \"I think we would turn it off if we could,\" Wilson said during his talk. But the problem is \"not as easy as that.\"On September 17, 2013, Blizzard stated that both the gold and real-money auction houses would be shut down on March 18, 2014. On March 18, 2014, Blizzard closed all the auction houses in Diablo III. Players had until June 24, 2014 to claim gold and items from the completed tab on the auction house interface.\n\n\n=== PvP combat ===\nPlayer versus player combat (PvP) was added to Diablo III in a limited form with the 1.0.7 patch, in February 2013. The Brawling system provides a simple free for all area where between two and four characters can fight and defeat each other as long as they like, but without any scores or damage being tracked. Players can participate by choosing from their existing characters, with access to all of the gear and skill they have gathered from playing the game in single-player or cooperative mode.\nPvP content for Diablo III had been discussed throughout the game's development, but on March 9, 2012, Blizzard announced that PvP had been delayed and would not be included with the game's release. Lead designer Jay Wilson said in a post on Battle.net that the PvP Arena system would arrive in a post-release patch; it would include multiple Arena maps with themed locations and layouts, PvP-centric achievements, and a quick and easy matchmaking system. \"We'll also be adding a personal progression system that will reward you for successfully bashing in the other team's skulls\", Wilson added.\nOn December 27, 2012, Blizzard announced that the previously mentioned Team Deathmatch or Arena mode was cancelled, because it did not have enough depth. Instead a simple PvP system would be added for the time being. That PvP mode was initially named Dueling, and was renamed to Brawling before release. Although the PvP systems initially outlined were not released, Blizzard stated that they will add other full-featured PvP systems in a future free content patch. In a May 2013 interview, Diablo III developer Wyatt Cheng stated that the development team was looking to see how the Brawling PvP evolves, while they \"continue to work on figuring out something more objective-based.\"\n\n\n=== Character classes ===\n\nThere are five available character classes from Diablo III and one from the Reaper of Souls expansion, for a total of six character classes; a seventh has been added in 2017. In the previous two games, each class had a fixed gender, but in Diablo III players may choose the gender they would like to play.\nThe Witch Doctor is a new character reminiscent of the Diablo II necromancer but with skills more traditionally associated with shamanism and voodoo culture. The witch doctor has the ability to summon monsters, cast curses, harvest souls, and hurl poisons and explosives at their enemies.  To power spells the Witch Doctor uses Mana, a vast pool of mental power which regenerates slowly.\nThe Barbarian previously appeared in Diablo II, and has a variety of revamped skills at its disposal based on incredible physical prowess. The barbarian is able to whirlwind through crowds, cleave through swarms, leap across crags, crush opponents upon landing, and grapple-snap enemies into melee range. The resource used by the barbarian is fury, which is generated through attacking enemies, getting attacked by enemies, and using certain abilities. Fury is used for the barbarian's strongest abilities and degenerates over time.\nThe Wizard is a version of the sorceress from Diablo II or the sorcerer from Diablo. The Wizard's abilities range from shooting lightning, fire and ice at their enemies to slowing time and teleporting past enemies and through walls. Wizards fuel their spells with arcane power, which is a shallow but fast-regenerating power source.\nThe Monk is a melee attacker, using martial arts to cripple foes, resist damage, deflect projectiles, attack with blinding speed, and land explosive killing blows. Monk gameplay combines the melee elements of Diablo II's assassin class with the \"holy warrior\" role of the paladin. Blizzard has stated that the monk is not related in any way to the monk class from the Sierra Entertainment–made Diablo: Hellfire expansion. The monk is fueled by spirit, which has defensive purposes and is slowly generated through attacking, though it does not degenerate.\nThe Demon Hunter combines elements of Diablo II's amazon and assassin classes. Demon hunters use bows and crossbows as their main weapons and can also throw small bombs and knives at enemies. The demon hunter is fueled by both discipline and hatred: Hatred is a fast regenerating resource that is used for attacks, while discipline is a slow regenerating resource used for defensive abilities involving acrobatics or shadows.\nThe Crusader is a Reaper of Souls expansion character. The crusader has a variety of combat skills at its disposal based on physical prowess, and typically wields a shield and an associated weapon (typically a flail). The crusader is able to ride a horse and strike enemies, shield bash enemies, summon a blessed hammer that circles around the crusader, leap into the air and come crashing down on enemies, have lightning strike foes from the sky, taunt enemies, hurl shields and hammers at enemies, and many more. The resource used by the crusader is wrath, which is generated through attacking enemies, getting attacked by enemies, and using certain abilities.\nThe Necromancer is a death-themed spellcaster, available as downloadable content for Reaper of Souls. Described as a \"reimagining\" of the previous incarnation seen in Diablo II, the necromancer specializes in controlling the dead, be it by summoning minions, reviving dead enemies temporarily or using their corpses as a medium to their magical powers, while using blood magic to power their offensive and defensive abilities. The resource used by the necromancer is essence, which is generated through attacking enemies with their primary skills.\nThe Archivist class was presented on April 1, 2009, following in Blizzard's April Fool's Day joke tradition. \nAll seven classes are represented in Blizzard's crossover multiplayer online battle arena title Heroes of the Storm (2015) as playable heroes. Players can choose between Sonya (the Barbarian), Johanna (the Crusader), Valla (the Demon Hunter), Kharazim (the Monk), Xul (the Necromancer), Nazeebo (the Witch Doctor), and Li-Ming (the Wizard).\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game takes place in Sanctuary, the dark fantasy world of the Diablo Series, twenty years after the events of Diablo II. Deckard Cain and Leah are in Tristram Cathedral (the same cathedral that was the setting of Diablo) investigating ancient texts regarding an ominous prophecy. A mysterious star falling from the sky strikes the Cathedral, creating a deep crater into which Deckard Cain disappears.\n\n\n=== Act I ===\nThe protagonist arrives in the town of New Tristram to investigate the falling star which struck the cathedral, which is now emanating risen undead. The protagonist accompanies Leah to the cathedral in order to rescue Cain from the crater into which he fell. After rescuing Cain, the protagonist learns that the only way to the fallen star is to defeat King Leoric, the former ruler of Khanduras known now as the 'Skeleton King'. Cain informs the protagonist that Leoric's crown must be recovered to defeat him, and the protagonist searches for Leoric's crown with the aid of Haedrig Eamon, the blacksmith of New Tristram. After recovering the crown, the protagonist returns to the cathedral where he/she eventually encounters and rescues Kormac, a warrior of the Templar order who has been taken captive by members of a cult known as the Dark Coven. Together, they defeat Leoric and find a stranger where the fallen star landed. The stranger's only memory is of a sword that shattered into three pieces as he fell.\nThe protagonist recovers the sword pieces from the Khazra Den and the Drowned Temple, opposed by the witch Maghda, leader of the Dark Coven - giving aid to a bandit named Lyndon in retrieving a false relic in the process. Maghda, however, recovers the third piece before the protagonist does and attempts to force Cain to repair the sword. Leah, however, kills the cultists with a surge of magical power, forcing Maghda to kill Cain and flee with the stranger. Cain, before dying, repairs the sword and tasks the protagonist with returning it to the stranger, revealing that both the sword and the stranger are angelic. The protagonist pursues Maghda into the bowels of King Leoric's dilapidated torture chambers underneath his manor, rescuing the stranger and returning to him his sword after a violent fight with the Butcher, a powerful demon. The stranger's memories are recovered, and it is revealed that he is the Archangel Tyrael, the Aspect of Justice. Disgusted with his fellow angels' unwillingness to protect humanity from the forces of Hell, Tyrael casts aside his divinity to become a mortal and warn Sanctuary about the arrival of the demon lords Belial (Lord of Lies) and Azmodan (Lord of Sin).\n\n\n=== Act II ===\nThe protagonist, Leah, and Tyrael travel to the city of Caldeum. The protagonist leaves to track down Maghda at Alcarnus as per orders from Asheara, commander of the Iron Wolves (returning from Diablo II), while Leah and Tyrael search for evidence of Belial in the city sewers. The protagonist first encounters a young Enchantress who introduces herself as Eirena, who hails from a different era. With Eirena's help, the protagonist finds and stops cultists from channeling an illusion by halting their progress. Continuing on, the protagonist reaches the Khasim Outpost, finding that Belial's serpent demons have imprisoned and replaced the true guards. Freeing Captain Davyd and his men, the protagonist reclaims the Khasim Outpost from the serpent demons and is given access to Alcarnus. After freeing the prisoners, the protagonist fights Maghda in her lair and kills her, avenging Cain, then returns to Caldeum to rescue Leah from the grasp of the Imperial Guards. Gaining an audience with the young Emperor of Caldeum, Hakan II, the protagonist is blamed for the chaos at Alcarnus, and the Emperor orders the protagonist's death and that Leah be brought to him, forcing the protagonist to escape the palace. Escaping to the sewers, Leah reveals that her mother, Adria (the witch of Tristram from the original game) is still alive. The protagonist aids Leah in rescuing Adria from the city's sewers.\nAdria reveals that the key to stopping the forces of Hell is the Black Soulstone. Crafted by the deranged warlock Zoltun Kulle, it has the power to trap the souls of the seven Lords of Hell and destroy them forever. Leah explains that Kulle was slain by the Horadrim before he could put the finishing touches on the stone, and that his severed head was sealed off in the lush Dahlgur Oasis. Adria instructs the protagonist to find the warlock's head in the oasis if the Soulstone is to be retrieved. After the head is retrieved, Leah revives the ghost of Zoltun Kulle, and Tyrael instructs him to activate the Black Soulstone. Kulle states that two vials of his blood hidden by the Horadrim in the Desolate Sands are needed to reach the stone. Leah decides to accompany the protagonist whilst putting the warlock's head in the protagonist's packs. After recovering the two vials of blood, the protagonist ventures into Kulle's archives in search of his body, while Leah prepares the ritual to bring Kulle back. After Kulle is brought back to life, the protagonist is then led into the archive's inner sanctum where the Black Soulstone is located, but is forced to defeat Kulle when the resurrected warlock attempts to take the soulstone for himself. Upon returning to Caldeum, the protagonist finds the city under attack by Belial's forces. Leah and Adria fight their way to the palace with the protagonist, revealing Belial as having taken the form of the Emperor to deceive them, and eventually defeat him. Leah then traps Belial's soul within the Black Soulstone, freeing Caldeum, after which she has a vision of the demon lord Azmodan, who is invading Sanctuary from the crater of Mount Arreat (destroyed by Tyrael in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction) in order to retrieve the Black Soulstone and empower himself, becoming the Prime Evil.\n\n\n=== Act III ===\nThe protagonist travels to Bastion's Keep with Tyrael, their followers, Leah and Adria only to find it under attack by Azmodan's army. Tyrael instructs the protagonist to aid the defenders, lighting the signal fires on the keep's walls, and raising the catapults. With that done, the protagonist enters the stronghold, where Azmodan's forces have breached the lower levels, defeating the demon Ghom, the Lord of Gluttony. The protagonist then takes to the battlefield, destroying Azmodan's siege weapons and traveling to the crater of Mount Arreat. Tyrael assists the protagonist in reaching the demonic gate protecting the crater, and destroys it with his sword, El'druin. After a gruesome battle with a huge Siegebreaker Assault Beast, the protagonist traverses the depths of Arreat's inner core, destroying the Sin Hearts, which empower Azmodan and his armies. Azmodan's consort Cydaea, the Maiden of Lust, attempts to protect the hearts, but is defeated by the protagonist, who then confronts and defeats Azmodan. Leah seals Azmodan's soul within the Black Soulstone. With all seven Lords of Hell trapped within the stone, Tyrael states that the Eternal Conflict between Heaven and Hell will be ended if the stone is destroyed. The protagonist returns to Bastion's Keep, but finds that Adria has betrayed them. Adria reveals she has been serving Diablo from the beginning, and that Leah's father is Leoric's son Aidan, the Dark Wanderer (the Warrior player character from the first game and Diablo's reincarnate body in Diablo II), who was possessed by Diablo. Adria uses the Black Soulstone to resurrect Diablo while forcing Leah to serve as his vessel. With all the souls of the Lords of Hell now within him, Diablo becomes the Prime Evil, and begins an assault on the High Heavens.\n\n\n=== Act IV ===\nThe protagonist arrives in the High Heavens to find that it is already under attack. Imperius, the Aspect of Valor, blames the protagonist and Tyrael for their downfall, causing Tyrael to give in to despair. On the other hand, the protagonist remains determined to fight, and defeats the demon Iskatu. The protagonist then meets Itherael, the Aspect of Fate, who instructs him to rescue Auriel, the Aspect of Hope, from Rakanoth, the Lord of Despair, in the Library of Fate. After rescuing Auriel and returning hope to the forces of Heaven, the protagonist is then instructed by Auriel to close the Hell Rifts. After this is done, the protagonist finds Tyrael, who has overcome his despair. Together, they attempt to stop Diablo from reaching the Crystal Arch, the source of power for the forces of Heaven, but not before a brawl with Izual, Tyrael's corrupted former lieutenant. After a long and fierce battle, Diablo is defeated and his physical manifestation is destroyed. The Black Soulstone is shown falling from the High Heavens, still intact. After the battle, Tyrael decides to rejoin the Angiris Council as the new Aspect of Wisdom, but remains a mortal, dedicated to building a permanent alliance between angels and humans.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDevelopment on Diablo III began in 2001 when Blizzard North was still in operation, and the game was first announced on June 28, 2008, at the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational in Paris, France. The original artistic design differed from that shown at Blizzard Worldwide Invitational 2008 demonstration, and had undergone three revisions before reaching the standards felt necessary by the team behind Diablo III. It was announced that the game would be simultaneously released on both Windows and Mac macOS platforms, and would require a constant internet connection to play, even for single-player mode.The proprietary engine incorporates Blizzard's custom in-house physics, a change from the original usage of Havok's physics engine, and features destructible environments with an in-game damage effect.\nDiablo III's lead designer was Jay Wilson, a former Relic Entertainment designer credited with work on Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War and Company of Heroes, as well as Blood II: The Chosen for Monolith Productions. The lead world designer was Leonard Boyarsky, one of the six co-creators of Fallout.Bobby Kotick from Activision announced in February 2012, that Diablo III would not launch in the 1st quarter of 2012; a slide show presentation at Activision's quarterly financial report listed the game's launch sometime in Q2 of 2012, and the release date of May 15, 2012, was announced on March 15, 2012.\n\n\n=== Beta ===\nOn May 9, 2011, Blizzard announced that Diablo III was expected to be released for external beta testing in Q3 of 2011. On September 7, 2011, Blizzard community manager Bashiok confirmed the start of the closed public beta test of the game with limited external testing by employees and their families. Testers were not restricted by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) i.e. every participant would be free to show, share, or talk about any portion of the beta content. On September 20, 2011, Blizzard announced through their Diablo III site that the closed beta test portion of the game through invites, promotions and giveaways had begun. On October 22, 2011, at BlizzCon, Diablo III game director Jay Wilson announced during an open Q&A that a new wave of beta invitations would be sent after an upcoming patch. Blizzard announced on April 19, 2012, that there would be an open beta weekend for the game, starting on April 20, 2012, and ending the morning of April 23. The closed beta ended on May 1, 2012.\nThe content available in the beta included the possibility to try all 5 character classes in the first act up to the Skeleton King encounter. The players were also able to try various in-game features such as crafting through the blacksmithing NPC, the auction house, hosting and joining public games as well as earning achievements.The beta website made references that measures would be in place to prevent future cheating.\n\n\n=== Post-launch improvements ===\nOn June 11, 2012, it was announced at Apple's 2012 WWDC keynote that native Retina display support will be coming to Diablo III. The following day, a Blizzard representative confirmed via the official Battle.net forums Apple's statement, the ongoing work by the developer on the optimization of the game engine for its rendering on the Retina display (and technically on other similar future high-density monitors) and that this optimization will be mainly for aesthetic purposes.Patch 1.0.4 introduced the paragon leveling system. After reaching the level cap of 60, characters continue to accumulate experience points, gaining paragon levels (up to a cap of 100), each of which provides a bonus to core stats (making characters more powerful and durable) and magic find and gold find (increasing the quantity and average quality of loot drops).Patch 1.0.5 expanded the difficulty settings with the addition of the Monster Power system. In addition to the Normal/Nightmare/Hell/Inferno difficulty system, players can also set Monster Power at any level from 0 to 10, with each level of Monster Power increasing the damage, health points, experience point yield and loot drop rates beyond the base value for a given difficulty tier.The first PvP addition to the game was in February 2013, as part of patch 1.0.7; a simple free-for-all system called \"Brawling\" and multiple item crafting options.\n\nOn February 25, 2014, patch 2.0.1 was released, introducing extensive changes in preparation for the Reaper of Souls expansion, which was itself released on March 25.\nFor Diablo's 20th anniversary, it was announced during BlizzCon 2016 that Diablo III would receive a free patch called The Darkening of Tristam that would recreate the original game. The patch will contain a 16-level dungeon, four main bosses from the 1996 version and special graphics filters and 8-directions limited movement like the original game. The patch is scheduled to release one week after the event, which happened on November 4, 2016.\n\n\n=== Console development ===\nOn January 10, 2012, Blizzard community manager Bashiok tweeted \"Yup. Josh Mosqueira is lead designer for the Diablo III console project\" however a Blizzard spokesperson later clarified that Bashiok's tweet was only \"intended as a confirmation that Blizzard is actively exploring the possibility of developing a console version of Diablo III,\" adding, \"This is not a confirmation that Diablo III is coming to any console platform.\"At Sony's Press Conference on February 20, 2013, Chris Metzen announced that Diablo III would release on both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. Activision Blizzard stated in their first-quarter 2013 earnings report, that the PlayStation 3 version of Diablo III would be released in 2013. On June 6, 2013, Blizzard announced that both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 port of the game would be released on September 3, 2013. A PS3 version of the game was published and localized by Square Enix in Japan, released there on January 30, 2014.In August 2013, Diablo III developers stated that they had started on the PlayStation 4 development of the game, titled Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition, and were looking at how to best utilize the new features of the PS4 controller, such as the TouchPad and the Share button. They are hopeful that characters from the PS3 version of Diablo III will be able to play directly on the PS4. In May 2014, Blizzard announced that Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition would be released on August 19, bringing the game to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The game will run at 1080p on PlayStation 4 and, while it was initially announced to run at 900p on Xbox One, a day one patch will enable it to run at 1080p. The consoles versions of Reaper of Souls added several new features exclusive to it, including the Nemesis System which will send a boss into your game that will hunt down your character specifically. If you defeat the boss you are awarded with a higher chance at legendary items, but if it kills your character it will come back, but stronger and also be transferred to another player on your friends list if you are online.\n\n\n== Marketing and release ==\n\nDiablo III was released on May 15, 2012. Players had the options to buy one of two retail boxed versions, a standard edition and collector's edition, or could also pre-order directly from Battle.net and download the installer in advance. On May 14, 2012, players who bought the downloadable version from Battle.net could install the rest of the game including patches. On May 15, 2012, the retail version could be bought from stores doing midnight launches such as GameStop. The Diablo III Battle.net servers went live at this point, people who downloaded the game could begin playing. Initially the launches were hindered by heavy server load with many users getting various errors, including the error 37 which reads; \"The servers are busy at this time. Please try again later\". These issues made the game unplayable for those affected, while some others experienced in-game bugs. Despite assurances from Blizzard that the problems leading to the connection errors during Diablo III's launch had been resolved, Eurogamer reported on May 31, 2012, that these errors were still ongoing, and had reappeared after patch 1.0.2 was released for the game. Many fans complained that the ongoing problems had caused them to lose their hardcore (permanent death) characters.In South Korea, players waited up to 36 hours to purchase the collector's edition.The release was also the source of a minor controversy in Australia when retailer Game went into voluntary administration the day before the release, and so was unable to honor pre-orders or offer refunds. In response to this, Blizzard Entertainment offered affected customers credit in purchasing the digital version of the game.On April 23, 2015, the game was released in China as it was approved by the Ministry of Culture. It used to be sold under the name \"Big Pineapple\" (大菠萝 Dɑ Boluo) which sounds similar to Diablo in Mandarin Chinese in order to dodge the sales ban.\n\n\n=== World of Warcraft promotion ===\nStarting at BlizzCon in October 2011, Blizzard offered an \"annual pass\" for World of Warcraft, where players who signed up for a 12-month subscription to that game received a free digital copy of Diablo III once released, as well as guaranteed beta access for the Mists of Pandaria expansion to World of Warcraft and a special Diablo-inspired mount called Tyrael's Charger in World of Warcraft.\n\n\n=== Starter Edition ===\nA demo version of the game, called the Starter Edition, was released simultaneously with the full release. It provides a limited introduction to the game where players can complete Act 1 up to the Skeleton King boss encounter with a level cap of 13. Originally after Diablo III's release the Starter Edition was only available through a guest pass code, which was included with the boxed versions of the game. Players have the option to upgrade to the full game through their Battle.net accounts. The Starter Edition became available to all users a few months after release on August 15, 2012.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nRussell Brower was the primary composer of the music for Diablo III. Additional music was composed by Derek Duke, Glenn Stafford, Joseph Lawrence, Neal Acree, Laurence Juber & Edo Guidotti. When composing for the orchestra, Brower tried to respect the Wagnerian style from the expansion to the second game in the series, Lord of Destruction. The Overture is considered the main theme of the game and it has been performed by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra, and was released on iTunes in 2009, as a single. A similar composition was used in the cinematic teaser trailer of the game. The Tristram theme from the first Diablo, also used in the second game, is present in Diablo III with some changes.. Irish choral ensemble Anúna also feature on the soundtrack. Brower stated that \"Working somewhat against conventional expectations, Hell is a beautiful and seductive sound, provided by Dublin’s uniquely astounding choral group ANÚNA\". A full soundtrack was released on iTunes on May 15, 2012 (the same day the game was released), as well as part of the Collector's Edition of the game.\n\n\n== Reaper of Souls expansion ==\n\nOn August 21, 2013, it was announced at the German games fair Gamescom that Diablo III: Reaper of Souls would be the first expansion for Diablo III. It features the fallen angel of wisdom Malthael as the expansion's main villain and is set in the city of Westmarch, which takes inspiration from many Gothic medieval locations. The expansion includes a new hero called the Crusader, an increased level cap to level 70, major improvements to loot drops including the ability to change item stats using an enchanting system, the ability to change the look of an item using transmogrification, and an improved Paragon leveling system which is account-wide and does not have a level cap.Reaper of Souls was released on March 25, 2014, for the Windows and macOS versions of Diablo III. The expansion pack content was released as part of the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition version for consoles on August 19 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. That edition expanded the base Diablo III game on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and brought the game for the first time to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nDiablo III has received positive reviews from critics, attaining scores of 88% and 88/100 on aggregate review websites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively.GamesRadar was positive about the game's opening act and its nods to past Diablo games saying \"we liked what we saw\".IGN was positive about the new skill system stating \"Instead of gameplay like Diablo II, where I often regretted how I allotted my ability points, Diablo III encourages experimentation and finding out exactly what works for your play-style. It's a vastly superior way to handle character abilities\", and praised the overall gameplay, stating \"the new systems really do make it a lot easier to enjoy Diablo III\". IGN further praised the game's new gameplay design, in particular the rune and loot systems, the randomly generated levels and the game's enjoyable unpredictability. It stated the game's feel is quite intuitive and also praised the game's sound and voicing.Rock, Paper, Shotgun gave mixed commentary during the game's beta period, praising the actual game itself by stating that it is much more direct than its predecessors and intuitive in its interface. However, it said the playing experience is spoiled due to lag in single-player mode caused by a lack of an offline single-player mode. Following the game's release, it reaffirmed its displeasure at the always-online DRM and offered a mixed opinion that the game was enjoyable but added \"nothing new\" to its genre.Users have voiced criticism about the game's strong digital rights management which requires what is known as persistent online authentication, resulting in the lack of an offline single-player mode.Erik Kain, a Forbes contributing writer, stated that the requirement to remain online is not necessary for single-player mode and that Blizzard is abusing its position as a \"juggernaut\" and is setting a worrying precedent for the gaming industry.  In response to questions about the lack of offline single-player, Diablo III senior producer Alex Mayberry said, \"Obviously StarCraft II did it, World of Warcraft authenticates also. It's kind of the way things are, these days. The world of gaming is not the same as it was when Diablo II came out.\"Gaming Blend supported the game's fanbase (referring to the user ratings on Metacritic and Amazon) and rejected counter-criticisms of the community.  It claims that the gaming industry at large is far too defensive of production companies' actions, to the point of accepting backward steps in game availability.  William Usher, the article's author said, \"Journalists should have been acknowledging consumer distaste rather than fueling it with pro-corporate pandering.\"While Gaming Blend disliked the always-online DRM, it did give the game a positive review. It stated the game includes interesting opportunities for experimentation and has great appeal for replaying over and over. The review concluded the game is \"smooth and entertaining\". A GameArena critic questioned how Blizzard managed to \"fail so spectacularly at creating reliable networking for Diablo 3\" before going on to point out the lack of competitive multiplayer.Many users criticized the art direction as it was considered too bright and colourful in contrast to the darker atmosphere of the previous releases. This led to petitions demanding Blizzard to change the design. The lead producer responded to these criticisms and explaining the design choices by stating that \"We feel that color actually helps to create a lot of highlights in the game so that there is contrast.\" He also highlighted that unlike the previous games, the players explore outdoors.The Black Soulstone footage won the 'Outstanding Visual Effects in an Animated Commercial or Video Game Trailer' award from the Visual Effects Society.\n\n\n=== Sales ===\nBefore its release, Diablo III broke several presale records and became the most pre-ordered PC game to date on Amazon.com. Activision Blizzard reported that Diablo III had broken the one-day PC sales records, accumulating over 3.5 million sales in the first 24 hours after release and over 6.3 million sales in its first week, including the 1.2 million people who obtained Diablo III through the World of Warcraft annual pass. On its first day, the game amassed 4.7 million players worldwide, an estimate which includes those who obtained the game via the World of Warcraft annual pass. In its 2012 second quarter report, Diablo III was reported to have pushed Activision Blizzard's expectations and as of July 2012, more than 10 million people had played the game. Diablo III remains the fastest selling PC game to date, and also one of the best-selling PC video games. As of the end of 2012, it had sold more than 12 million copies, and as of March 2013, Blizzard stated that Diablo III had around 1 million daily players, with 3 million unique players each month. As of May 2013, Diablo III had been played by 14.5 million unique players, according to Blizzard's released statistics. As of February 2014, the game had sold 15 million copies across all platforms. As of June 30, 2014, Diablo III and Reaper of Souls had combined sales worldwide of more than 20 million copies. As of June 30, 2015, the game had sold, along with Reaper of Souls, 30 million units.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== South Korea ===\nOn May 28, 2012, Blizzard Entertainment's offices in South Korea were raided by the Fair Trade Commission amid allegations that the company had breached consumer rights laws, including suspected violations of Korea's law on electronic commerce and commercial contracts. Players in Korea requested refunds from Blizzard based on their inability to play Diablo III, but Blizzard cited the terms of sale and refused to grant these requests. Hundreds of gamers filed formal complaints with the FTC, and in June 2012 Blizzard started offering players full refunds.\n\n\n=== France ===\nOn June 15, 2012, French consumers group UFC Que Choisir announced that it had received 1,500 complaints in four days regarding connectivity issues with Diablo III. As a result of this, the organization asked Blizzard Entertainment to provide a permanent solution by June 30, 2012, and to \"communicate completely and transparently about problems encountered in due time\". They also requested that gamers be given reimbursement for any troubles they may have encountered. In addition, they asked the French government to take a closer look at games with online-only DRM. On June 28, Blizzard replied to the Que Choisir that the box for Diablo III clearly labelled that a high-speed internet connection was required and that most of the stability issues had been fixed.\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nThe German Federation of Consumer Organizations threatened legal action if Blizzard did not respond to complaints about Diablo III's lack of clear information on the German version of the box by July 27, 2012, regarding the always-online requirement and lack of ability to resell the digital game.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nCommunity site",
      "We’ve got many Blizzard games covered here – WarCraft II, StarCraft, Diablo, Diablo II – all of them five-star titles. Blizzard’s track record in producing top selling and critically acclaimed games is nothing short of impressive, so let’s take a closer look at this company, its history and learn just what makes it tick.Blizzard was founded in February of 1991 as Silicon & Synapse, Inc., and up until February of 1994 developed numerous games for other publishers, including Amiga Lord of the Rings, Amiga Battlechess II, and The Lost Vikings, Blackthorne and The Life and Death of Superman. Silicone & Synapse changed its name first to Chaos Studios and then to Blizzard Entertainment in April of 1994, the same year it was acquired by Davidson & Associates, Inc. In November of that year, Blizzard released the first game under its new label, WarCraft: Orcs and Humans.“Dune II was the one that started it all,” explained Blizzard’s Bill Roper in an interview some years back. “We couldn’t believe that no one else, including Westwood, had ever done another game that had this real-time strategy element. [WarCraft] got strong reviews and was really well accepted by journalists and the hardcore gaming community. For a first title it sold really well, and Davidson was ecstatic with it. We did more than our projected numbers and it established what I think has always been a precedent for Blizzard. We really work to make excellent, definitive titles.”In December of 1995, Blizzard released its biggest game yet WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness. This would be the first in a string of games that would garner game of the year honors from various sources and top the sales charts. WarCraft II expanded on the gameplay of the first game, offering a new resource to mine in oil, and it was the first game with playable naval units.The initial concept for WarCraft II was something that would never reach the store shelves. “We had this whole new idea about the opening cinematics. You would see a couple of fighter pilots flying their F-16s, and one guy would radio about bogeys coming in, and then the other would say, ‘I know where it is! I’ve got it on my scope!’ Then a dragon would come in and flame this F-16. It was going to be WarCraft II with the orcs and trolls and ogres and dragons all coming in through a dark portal into modern day earth. We would have had guys with machine guns and hand grenades. We talked about it for another couple of hours and then said, ‘Nah, that’s a really bad idea.’ I’m really glad we got that one out of the way and stuck with full fantasy.”WarCraft II and Westwood Studios’ Command & Conquer were released within months of one another, and these two games helped expand the multiplayer gaming scene, with no small thanks to Kali, a $20 software utility and matching service that allowed players to spoof a LAN connection and play these games over the Internet (much like GameRanger is still used today to play these games online). Blizzard supported Kali and WarCraft II played with a special executable they released: war2kali.exe.The nearly simultaneous release of these two powerhouse games also sparked a bit of a rivalry between Westwood and Blizzard. “It was a very friendly and very respectful rivalry,” explains Roper. “It was back and forth between us and we both were the better for it. It helped to escalate and skyrocket the genre. I have nothing but the utmost respect for Westwood. They made some great games and they still make great games.”In May of 1996 Blizzard released the expansion WarCraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal. In July of 1996, CUC Software Services (which also owned Sierra) acquired Davidson and Blizzard. By September of that year, WarCraft II reached 1.2 million copies sold and was the number-one selling title of the year.From January of ’97 to the present, Blizzard was busy, releasing Diablo, StarCraft, Brood War and Diablo II, all of which enjoyed critical and commercial success. CUC became the Cendant Corporation, and Cendant was evenutally purchased by Havas, a French company. In 1999 Blizzard released its most recent WarCraft product, the WarCraft II Battlenet Edition, which included a few minor tweaks, but was mainly done to provide a native Windows version of the game with built-in Battle.net support.There is one more WarCraft game that Blizzard worked on that was never finished, WarCraft Adventures: Lord Of The Clan. “One thing we’ve always tried to do as a company is make the kinds of game that excite us and that we want to play, and that was the impetus behind making it,” explains Roper. “As we went along we found out that there’s a lot of different things that we had never done before that we needed to do for this game. We didn’t like the way some of the puzzles worked, so we ended up bringing in Steve Meretzky to make a pass over the whole project.”Roper said that Blizzard began to feel that the opportunity to release an old style adventure game had slipped away. “Curse of Monkey Island came out and Grim Fandango was next in line for Lucas, and we really started to feel like the game wouldn’t live up to the expectations of fans. We just decided that it wouldn’t be what our fans want or what we want, so we made the very hard decision to cancel the project.” Roper did mention that some parts of WarCraft Adventures made it into WarCraft III, including Thrall, the orcish Warchief and leader of the Horde. “Some of the characters and storylines we created will be used in WarCraft III. The animation we did is probably going to stay locked up in the Blizzard vaults forever.”When approaching Blizzard Entertainment’s Irvine headquarters at around 2003, the first thing you would notice is how bland and corporate its facilities were – sprawling across several floors in a nondescript building, with room after room of cubes and offices. Looking back at this sterile and dull environment, it’s difficult to figure out where Blizzard keeps the magic that has led to the creation of games like Diablo and StarCraft. Where were the diodes with bolts of electrical energy arcing between them? Why wasn’t the ceiling cranked open to draw upon the mystical creative energies of the universe? Why are there printers and paperclips and not tomes of ancient wisdom scattered on these desks? Just where is the magic?Inside those walls, Blizzard conjured their venerable third installment of the WarCraft series of real-time strategy games, taking the game into 3D and tweaking the standard “collect resources, build a town and defenses, amass an army, attack your opponent” style of gameplay. WarCraft III represented a number of firsts for Blizzard. Perhaps most significantly, it’s the first game that melds role-playing to real-time strategy. As reported in its conceptual phases, Blizzard has once called WarCraft III an “RPS”, which is its term for a role-playing strategy game – after seeing the game in action, it’s easy to see why. “We want players to focus on managing battles and casting spells and counterspells, […] We don’t want players to have to be in the base all the time and micromanage.”Few early strategy games have made the move to 3D with any measure of success; usually, it just adds to the complexity of the control scheme. The more you make the player responsible for finding the proper angles to view the game, the tougher it is to play. Not only did Warcraft III get the 3D portion right (despite being Blizzard’s first true 3D game), but it also enjoyed the same sort of unrelenting balance and fluid gameplay that characterized all of their titles. So how is it that Blizzard retained its almost legendary Midas touch throughout the ages?Roper gives an interview in ‘Game Design: Secrets of the Sages’, a book published by BradyGames in 2000, where he explains it quite well: “While game designers have to keep a lot of balls in the air at once, the single most important factor is your audience. Never lose sight of who the game is made for and what they want and expect out of the product.[…] We also play a lot of games at Blizzard and view them with a critical eye for ideas, both good and bad. During every phase of the design process, we kept our audience in mind; core gamers who demand longevity with involving strategic gameplay and more casual gamers who need to be able to play the game just by sitting down with the keyboard and mouse. Our goal was to make the game easy to learn but difficult to master…”“We have always been focused on creating the best games possible and have remained dedicated to not releasing a game until it meets the standards that both we and our fans have set. While this is a very difficult path to follow, especially when the end of the year approaches and the game just isn’t done, it is the guiding tenet of our company and has served us very well if the sales and following that Diablo and StarCraft have generated are any indication.”The menu screen for WarCraft: Orcs & HumansGameplay from WarCraft Adventures.Gameplay from Warcraft III.

      "Blizzard Entertainment is a PC game developer and publisher. Since its release of Warcraft in 1994, it has been one of the most successful game development studios in the world. Its headquarters are based in Irvine, California. The company has a history of largely overshooting release dates. However, many Blizzard fans see this as somewhat of a blessing in disguise, as Blizzard has a reputation for producing classic games that are played for years to come.  Blizzard also has a reputation for taking fierce legal action against anyone who reverse engineers their software, copies their game concepts, or publishes third-party server software that is compatible with their games.Blizzard Entertainment was founded in February, 1991 as Silicon & Synapse by Mike Morhaime, Allen Adham and Frank Pearce. The company developed games like Rock & Roll Racing and The Lost Vikings (published by Interplay Productions). In 1994, the company briefly changed its name to Chaos Studios, before finally settling on Blizzard Entertainment after it was discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed. That same year, they were acquired by distributor Davidson & Associates for under USD$10 million. Shortly thereafter, Blizzard shipped their breakthrough hit Warcraft.Blizzard has changed hands several times since then: Davidson was acquired by a timeshare company called CUC International in 1996; CUC then merged with a hotel, real-estate, and car-rental franchiser called HFS Corporation to form Cendant Software, in 1997. In 1998 it became apparent that CUC had engaged in accounting fraud for years before the merger; Cendant's stock lost 80% of its value over the next six months in the ensuing widely discussed accounting scandal. The company sold its consumer software operations, including Blizzard, to French publisher Havas in 1998, the same year Havas was purchased by Vivendi. Blizzard is now part of the VU Games group of Vivendi Universal.In 1996, Blizzard acquired Condor Games, which had been working on the game Diablo for Blizzard at the time. Condor was renamed Blizzard North, and has since developed hit games Diablo, Diablo II, and its expansion pack Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. Blizzard North was located in San Mateo, California.Blizzard launched their online gaming service Battle.net in January of 1997 with the release of their action-RPG Diablo.On November 23, 2004, Blizzard released World of Warcraft, which has grown to become one of the most popular MMORPGs in history.On May 16, 2005, Blizzard announced the acquisition of Swingin' Ape, a console game maker, which is now Blizzard Console, currently working on Starcraft: Ghost, but in March 2006 (last mentioned on the website on March 30, 2006) they announced that Starcraft: Ghost was on indefinite hold.On August 1, 2005, Blizzard announced the consolidation of Blizzard North into the headquarters in Irvine, California.A few months after the closure of Blizzard North, Bill Roper, Erich Schaefer and his brother Max Schaefer co-founded Flagship Studios which now is developing Mythos (on July 19, 2008 it was announced that due to continuing financial hardships at Flagship Studios, Mythos would be going on hiatus)  and Hellgate London released in the fall of 2007.Blizzard is currently a division of Activision Blizzard, Inc. as a result of a merger that was announced on December 7th, 2007. The merger was completed on July 9th, 2008.[1]Notable Blizzard personel include:These are the following awards received for Blizzard Entertainment and Diablo related.[2] For other game awards, Template:Gamepedia and StarCraft.This section contains facts and trivia relevant to this article",
      "Diablo III is the third game in the Diablo series, an action role-playing videogame developed by Blizzard Entertainment. It was released internationally for Microsoft Windows in 2012 and a console version was made available one year later, in September 2013. Since 2014, the RPG game can also be played on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles, which also support the sequel Diablo III Reaper of Souls.Diablo III picks up where the story left in the previous installment, with players getting to choose between five different characters. For the first time in franchise history, they can choose both male and female characters for all these classes. The necromancer is no longer available as it was replaced by the witch doctor It has the ability of harvesting souls, hurling explosives and enemies and cursing them.The Barbarian used to be the most played class in Diablo games and it is very popular in the latest installment, thanks to his or her physical prowess. At the opposite end of the spectrum, we have the wizards, an upgraded version of the sorceress. They use arcane power to cast spells, shoot ice, fire and lightning at enemies while teleporting past them and other obstacles.Diablo III games are much more exciting thanks to the introduction of new classes, with the monk being an all-around melee attacker. He uses spirit as the main resource to cast defensive abilities and is extremely resilient, which makes him an excellent choice for tanking. The Demon Hunter inflicts terrible damage upon opponents using a combination of discipline and hatred, the main resources for this class. The former regenerates slowly and is used for defense, while hatred regenerates much faster.Diablo III games are pretty challenging, but those who consider themselves seasoned players, can check out the hardcore characters. They can only do this when they reach level X and hardcore characters don’t come back to life after being killed. This makes it extremely important for players to pay attention to every aspect of the game, because in this game mode, death is irreversible. These characters are separately ranked, so one would have to find a peer playing on a hard-core character to team up.Diablo III is an action role-playing videogame published and developed by Blizzard Entertainment, the third installment in the series. Five characters are initially available, with those who purchase the expansion pack Diablo III Reaper of Souls gaining access to the Crusader character as well. The game set several records upon release, selling more than 30 million copies across PCs and consoles.Diablo III doesn’t stray too far from the gameplay that made popular the previous installments and characters inflict damage and defend as they did in the prequel. By leveling up and acquiring better equipment, they can improve their hit points, inflict extra damage and they get more resilient. The items range from regular ones to magic-quality items with the most powerful artifacts being rare and legendary. They improve the basic stats Intelligence, Dexterity and Strength and have one extra random property.As players advance with the single player campaign, they get to fight increasingly tougher bosses Weapons and armor can also be acquired from artisans, which are non-playable characters selling these items. Players can purchase the accessories they need or scrap for resources and special materials. Artisans can mix them together to create powerful artifacts. They also themselves level up and the higher their skill level, the better the items they sell.Diablo III wasn’t the game to invent followers in the series, but introduces three new ones. THeyserve a more important role than the ones in the prequels. Kormac the Templar, Lyndon the Scoundrel and Eirena the Enchantress are the three options. Each of them fight alongside the player, using unique skills. They are extremely useful, although in major boss fights they can’t move or aid the player in any way.For three years, players had the option of using auction houses to buy and sell in-game currency for real cash. They served the purpose of helping players speed up the leveling process and acquire better gear without spending so much time in game. Due to legal concerns as well as the stiff opposition of some players, the auction houses were shut down in March 2014, after players claimed their gold and items.Diablo III’s narrative takes place in the same fantasy world of Sanctuary, two decades after the events of the prequel. The falling of a mysterious star triggers a chain of events that sends the protagonist on an epic quest that culminates with a fight against the Ancient Evil. The narrative is divided into four Acts, with each of them pitting players against legions of monsters and concluding with the defeat of a boss.In the first act, players have to defeat the former ruler of Tristram, King Leoric before meeting Tyrael were them about the upcoming work. Belial and Azmodan plan on destroying the world of men, so the protagonist, Leah, and Tyrael scramble to stop them in their tracks. In the second act, they face Maghda, a powerful witch and a deranged warlock that goes by the name of Zoltun Kulle. Belial is the last demon to fall at their hands in this part of the story, before they move on to kill demon lord Azmodan.Most of the story in the third act unfolds in the Bastion's Keep were Tyrael and the protagonist managed to track all seven Lords of Hell within the Black Soulstone. Unfortunately one of their key allies turns against them and uses the powerful artifacts to make Diablo the Prime Evil. Leah is used as a vessel for his return and the battle for the High Heavens begins with an epic fight between Diablo and Imperius. We won’t spoil the ending because it is truly epic and features some of the best cinematics of this franchise.Diablo III was developed over the course of more than a decade, with the first rumors surfacing back in 2008. Blizzard Entertainment used the proprietary engine, instead of sticking to the one provided by Havok, but worked closely with some of the leading game designers. The game was released on May 15, 2012 in most countries and one year later, it was also made available for consoles.Blizzard Entertainment is the main source for those who want to download Diablo III and on the website they can also acquire the expansion Diablo III Reaper of Souls. The famous videogame developer and publisher is also the one selling World of Warcraft, World of Warcraft Warlords of Draenor, StarCraft Legacy of the Void, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch can also be downloaded here.Diablo III was well received by the critics, while sending shockwaves across the entire community of fans. They were waiting for 12 years and were thrilled with the result, praising the developers for the manner in which they continued the narrative. A decade of waiting also presented Blizzard with a chance of using the latest advancements of technology, which show clearly in the outstanding graphics and cinematics. The only criticism was in regard to the digital rights management which demands players to be always online when playing.PvP combat is pretty much the only way to compete against other players, a far cry from the multiplayer demanded by the fans. The Brawling system is actually a free for all game, while the Team Deathmatch or Arena initially announced was canceled altogether. This means that there won’t be any Diablo III tournaments in the foreseeable future and if you want to get your kicks from multiplayer, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch and StarCraft Legacy of the Void would be better options.I grew up with this franchise and I can still remember how I’ve played the original game an entire summer and those three months felt like a week. I had high expectations for Diablo III and they were met by Blizzard Entertainment, with its immersive narrative, compelling characters and tougher bosses. The game is addictive, as it should be and with so many difficulty levels, both amateurs and savvy players should be satisfied. I wholeheartedly rate the game 9.5 out of 10 and look forward for the next installment.REVIEW OVERVIEWOverall Score9.5SUMMARYIn Diablo III the world of Sanctuary calls upon you once again. Answer its call and save the it from an ancient evil that has returned to wreak havoc upon the realm of men.9.5OVERALL SCORE",
      "﻿Rush posted about the current issue of US PC Gamer with their D3 cover story a few days ago, but I wanted to compare the UK and US editions of the magazine. Both use the official Blizzcon 2008 artwork, but as you can see in the thumbnails, they have different captions. The US cover is on top (larger view here). It says, “Diablo III leads the top games of 09” a caption clearly designed to spur debate over whether or not D3 will be released in this calendar year. There doesn’t seem to be anything new about D3 inside the issue, unfortunately: .“None of the info in the article is new, but they do have an interview with Rob Pardo on the next page discussing other Blizz games.”Here’s the UK cover, with the same image but a different caption. It says, “Why Blizzard Rule 2009.” The specific focus on D3 isn’t there, despite the articles inside the magazine being much the same. One is posted online, and it gives a general overview of why (in PC Gamer’s fluffing opinion) Blizzard games are so great. Here’s the intro:It’s not a huge mystery, but it’s an interesting question. Why the difference in the PC Gamer cover story approaches? Controversy sells more in the US? US gamers are more impatient and must be promised (by media, if not Blizzard) that games are coming out much sooner than they actually will? Diablo III is a bigger draw in the US while UK games are more interested in Blizzard on the whole?Copyright 2018 | Enthusiast Gaming. All Rights ReservedInformationConnectionsSubmitAdvertising",
      "Diablo fans are among the longest suffering subgroups of Blizzard aficionados, but the end is in sight – the studio says we’re going to see more Diablo “later this year.” If you’re feeling incredibly optimistic you may mean a Diablo 4 announcement at BlizzCon. Though that’s not the only possibility, it’s not an unlikely scenario.In a video titled The Future of Diablo, community manager Brandy Camel says “the forges here at Blizzard are burning hot, and we have multiple Diablo projects in the works. Some of them are going to take longer than others. But we may have some things to show you later this year. We hope you stay tuned while we work to bring these Diablo experiences to life.”We’ve been reporting on Diablo 4 possibilities for years, with job postings giving us a hint about what to expect from the next Diablo game. We’ve heard similar rumblings of a mobile Diablo title as well, which certainly could be Blizzard’s next announcement – though showing a mobile game without confirming Diablo 4 wouldn’t go down super well with series fans.BlizzCon 2018 is scheduled for November 2 and 3, and the annual event is the perfect stage for an announcement on the scale of a new Diablo. Again, no guarantee – but you and I are both secretly hoping for it, and Blizzard has to know. (Right?)Today’s video also offers some detail on Diablo 3’s new season structure, which recently kicked off with the Season of Greed – that themed season path is set to continue in the future. You can find out more about that directly from Blizzard while you hack and slash away the hours in hot anticipation of whatever’s next.ShareClicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.PromotedHow to master Monster Hunter: World’s deep combat system7 reasons you should return to RuneScape and Old School RuneScapeWhy a visit to Monster Hunter: World should be your videogame summer vacation",
      "It was announced at BlizzCon in November that, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Diablo (which came out on New Year’s Eve, 1996), Blizzard would remake it within Diablo 3, and add various special content to all of its other games. All of that is now happening, with the Anniversary event now live in World of Warcraft. A new video has also gone up on the Diablo YouTube channel, with more details about how the remake within Diablo 3 will go down.Feeling nostalgic for the ’90s? Check out some of the best classic games on PC.The biggest of the Anniversary celebrations is probably in Azeroth. If you enter World of Warcraft today, you’ll find that – contrary to Blizzard’s many previous denials – there is in fact a cow level. The Secret Cow Level contains several level 100+ enemies, including the Diabolic Bovine, Diabolic Tauren, and the Cow King himself, who drops special loot when killed. This includes a Scroll of Town Portal and a Twelve-String Guitar, which, if obtained, will award the ‘Diablo’s 20th Anniversary’ achievement.To get to the Secret Cow Level, you’ll need to kill the Treasure Goblin which can now spawn in the Dalaran sewers, at the end of instances, and various other locations. Full details can be found at MMO Champion.Blizzard’s other games are celebrating Diablo’s anniversary with lesser content. Specifically, you can get Diablo-themed sprays and a player icon in Overwatch; a new portrait in Heroes of the Storm for its ‘High Heavens brawl’; a Lord of Terror worker portrait for StarCraft II; and a hooded stranger comes to Hearthstone in a Diablo-themed Tavern Brawl.But of course, the biggest event of all is reserved for Diablo’s descendent, Diablo 3. Patch 2.4.3, also called the Anniversary patch, will add the whole of the original Diablo game in the form of a time-limited event called The Darkening of Tristram. All 16 levels of Diablo’s defiled cathedral will be recreated using Diablo 3’s assets, but Blizzard wanted to go further to really capture the look and feel of the 1996 classic. The remade dungeon will thus have a pixelated visual filter, a fixed isometric camera, tinnier sounds, stiffer animations and no running.The Anniversary patch doesn’t have a release date yet, but Blizzard say it’s “right around the corner”. Speculation on YouTube suggests it could land as soon as Friday, since that’s when the next season starts and the patch does include some gameplay changes. Greater Rift and some items are getting tweaked, some quality of life changes are incoming (such as the ability to kill enemies mid-leap), and a new vendor, Miriam, will handle dying your clothes. You can check this post on the Diablo forums for a full overview of patch 2.4.3.The Darkening of Tristram will end with January, but there’s a chance it could return on an annual basis.ShareClicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.PromotedHow to master Monster Hunter: World’s deep combat system7 reasons you should return to RuneScape and Old School RuneScapeWhy a visit to Monster Hunter: World should be your videogame summer vacation",
      "It’s been twenty years since the incantations of dark rituals first echoed from the cathedral buried beneath Tristram and the denizens of the Burning Hells were unleashed upon Sanctuary under the command of the series’ titular villain, Diablo. Since then, millions of players have experienced the intense and enthralling gameplay that’s become a hallmark of the series. Here’s to twenty more!In 1996, Blizzard Entertainment released Diablo®, merging fast-paced point-and-click action with the character customization and progression found in traditional role-playing games. With immense replayability, memorable music, and a brooding atmosphere, Diablo defined the action-RPG genre, influencing many games to follow.At BlizzCon 2016, we gathered a group of veteran demon slayers to spill their guts about what Diablo means to them. Check out the video to relive powerful memories from Sanctuary, as retold by Diablo developers past and presentIn Diablo, you took up arms as a valiant Rogue, Sorcerer, or Warrior scouring the catacombs beneath the troubled town of Tristram to face an evil that threatened to infest the entire world—the Dark Lord, Diablo.Diablo was released for both Mac and Windows PCs, a rarity at the time; to face a threat this menacing, it was critical to recruit as many potential heroes as possible. In addition to pitting players against a seemingly endless horde of vile, demonic, and undead creatures, Diablo also empowered those hungry for a more social gaming experience through our trailblazing online service, Battle.net. In its first month of operation, Battle.net brought players together in more than 1.5 million games.Diablo II brought a four Act structure to the series, with heroes traveling to distant lands over the course of their quest to cleanse Sanctuary of evil. In Diablo II, you battled several of the most sinister forces of the Burning Hells, including Duriel, the Lord of Pain; Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred; and Diablo, the Lord of Terror. As players became embroiled in the conflict between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells, the Diablo series become recognized for its unique approach to traditional “good vs. evil” storytelling.Diablo II’s five unique classes (Amazon, Barbarian, Necromancer, Paladin, and Sorceress) broadened the core archetypes of the previous game, and the customizable skill trees made these classes feel unique. New mechanics—socketed items, gems, dual wielding, hirelings, and more—rounded out the series’ feeling of constant progression, and of developing your hero to your specifications. Updates to Battle.net made it easier than ever for you to party up, engage in thrilling duels, hunt down valuable artifacts, and compete for a spot on the ladder—all while adventuring online.In Diablo II: Lord of Destruction®, you hunted down Baal, the last of the Prime Evils, as he ravaged the Barbarians of Arreat in search of the Worldstone, a priceless relic tied into the fabric of the world of Sanctuary. Lord of Destruction also added two new classes to Diablo II’s roster: the Druid, a versatile master of shape-shifting, summoning, and elemental magic; and the Assassin, a practitioner of mental disciplines, skilled in the use of traps and deadly martial arts.Diablo II’s already prodigious item list expanded with rune words, charms, jewels, and new item properties like “ethereal.” Changes to the game allowed hirelings to level up and equip items, laying the groundwork for Diablo III’s followers.Twenty years after the destruction of the Worldstone and the Prime Evils’ banishment from Sanctuary, rumors of a fallen star brought heroes to the rebuilt town of Tristram in search of an omen of the end times.In addition to Barbarians—returning from Diablo II—players could now portray Demon Hunters, Monks, Witch Doctors or Wizards, and choose between male or female variants of each character class, a first for the series. Diablo III’s unique skill system allowed players to switch their abilities at will, incorporating unparalleled flexibility and experimentation into the series. All-new artisans brought additional depth to the crafting of gems and equipment that have become a big part of Diablo’s identity.When Malthael, the Angel of Death, stole the Black Soulstone containing the essence of the seven Prime Evils, the fallen Archangel of Justice, Tyrael, charged you with finding and stopping Malthael before he could bend the Stone’s infernal power to his will. You explored the sprawling streets of Westmarch and ventured deep into the Pandemonium Fortress in a desperate bid to stop death itself.Diablo III: Reaper of Souls™ added a new class (the Crusader) as well as a new Act to explore. It also included Adventure Mode, a brand new way to experience Diablo through bounties and Nephalem Rifts, randomized dungeons that meld the deadliest locales of Sanctuary with dangerous demons, taking the game’s substantial replayability to a whole new level.Coming in 2017, the Rise of the Necromancer pack will bring the priests of Rathma, commanders of the dead, to Diablo III: Reaper of Souls. The pack will also give players access to additional character slots, an in-game pet, and more. Watch the preview video and the BlizzCon presentations below to learn more.We look to Diablo’s legacy and our passionate player community for inspiration. You drive us to keep making Diablo an enjoyable experience for everyone. We hope you’ll continue to enjoy playing for many years to come.",
      "What a great article. 10/10An excellent read! Well done.These sorts of decisions are why Blizzard is still held in such high regard.\nThey might be just as businessy as anyone else (they are Activision after all), but they understand that as long as they commit to quality irrespective of time scales involved, their brand will sell games.\nAnd really, how many companies branding is enough to guarantee sales these days? Maybe Nintendo? I can't think of any other major examples.Blizzard, Nintendo and Valve are the three companies that spring to my mind.Buy my book/10I love bliz, they can do no wrong in my eyes. I got caught by the GAME insolvency and lost my collectors edition of D3 I had fully paid off.Bliz was kind enough to upgrade my account, apologised for not being able to supply the physical items, and credited my account the difference between the standard and collectors editions.D3 died. im waitting for D4 hopfuly that will be done right, D2 is more active.Wow what a great insight. This excerpt really nails how D3 has evolved. I played briefly pre- reaper of souls and loot 2.0 and i just couldnt get into it like i could diablo 2. I liked it but i just thought i was done with this kind of game. The 4 legendaries that i managed to roll after playing for weeks that i couldn't use didnt help either. Fast forward to the current era and its a completely better game. Adventure mode really saved it + all the other enhancements they've added and im finally hooked. Great read and now a great game.How they fixed Diablo 3: They got rid of Jay \"Fuck that loser\" Wilson.Awesome article, really enjoyed it... And may have to give Diablo III another crack since I last tried it back after and 'til a month or so after initial launch![Please don't use \"addicting\", at least not as an adjective, when you want \"addictive\". It's a funny meme *because* of it being wrong... Language adapts and all that, so let's not make it right, especially in print form :-P]They didnt save it... They turned it into something the fans didnt like, but the masses loves.\"What became apparent to Blizzard in the coming months was that people were more interested in gaming Diablo 3 than they were in playing it\"... What does this even mean? xDPlease log in or register to gain access to this feature.",
      "Diablo III is a dungeon crawler action role-playing video game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. It is the third installment in the Diablo franchise and was released in the Americas, Europe, South Korea, and Taiwan on May 15, 2012, and Russia on June 7, 2012,[6] for Microsoft Windows and macOS. A console version was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on September 3, 2013.[5] Versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released on August 19, 2014.[7]In the game, players choose one of seven character classes – Barbarian, Crusader, Demon Hunter, Monk, Necromancer, Witch Doctor or Wizard (with the Crusader being unavailable unless the player has purchased the expansion pack, Diablo III: Reaper of Souls and the Necromancer added later as separate online purchase) – and are tasked with defeating the Lord of Terror, Diablo.Diablo III set a new record for fastest-selling PC game selling over 3.5 million copies in the first 24 hours of its release,[8] and was the best selling PC game of 2012, selling over 12 million copies during the year.[9] It has sold, along with Reaper of Souls, 30 million copies across all platforms. Diablo III received critical acclaim from critics, although its digital rights management that requires an internet connection at all times was criticized.The expansion pack Diablo III: Reaper of Souls was released for the Windows and macOS editions of the game on March 25, 2014. For consoles the expansion pack content was released as part of the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition version. It was released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 on August 19, 2014. Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition includes the original console version of Diablo III and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls expansion pack.[3] The second expansion Diablo III: Rise of the Necromancer was released for the Windows, macOS, and latest-generation console editions of the game on June 27, 2017.[147]Much like in Diablo and Diablo II, the quality and attributes of equipment are randomized. In addition to base stats (such as damage and attack speed for weapon or armor points on armor), higher-quality items have additional properties, such as extra damage, attribute bonuses, bonuses to critical hit chance or sockets (which allow items to be upgraded and customized by adding gems for various stat bonuses). Magic-quality items have 1 to 3 random properties, rare-quality items have 4 to 6 random properties and legendary-quality items typically have 6 to 8 properties with varying degrees of randomness (for example, the Mempo of Twilight, a legendary helm, always has a socket, bonuses to elemental resistance, attack speed and life, a bonus to either Intelligence, Dexterity or Strength, and one additional random property, however the magnitude of these bonuses varies from item to item), and set items are a subtype of legendary items which provide additional, cumulative bonuses if multiple items from the same set are simultaneously equipped. Higher level monsters tend to drop higher level items, which tend to have higher base stats and bonuses.[13]The proprietary engine incorporates Blizzard's custom in-house physics, and features destructible environments with an in-game damage effect. The developers sought to make the game run on a wide range of systems without requiring DirectX 10.[14] Diablo III uses a custom 3D game engine[15] in order to present an overhead view to the player, in a somewhat similar way to the isometric view used in previous games in the series.[14] Enemies utilize the 3D environment as well, in ways such as crawling up the side of a wall from below into the combat area.[16]As in Diablo II, multiplayer games are possible using Blizzard's Battle.net service,[17] with many of the new features developed for StarCraft II also available in Diablo III.[14] Players are also able to drop in and out of sessions of co-operative play with other players.[18] Unlike its predecessor, Diablo III requires players to be connected to the internet constantly due to their DRM policy, even for single-player games.An enhanced quest system, a random level generator, and a random encounter generator are used in order to ensure the game provides different experiences when replayed.Unlike previous iterations, gold can be picked up merely by touching it, or coming within range, adjusted by gear, rather than having to manually pick it up. One of the new features intended to speed gameplay is that health orbs drop from enemies, replacing the need to have a potion bar, which itself is replaced by a skill bar that allows a player to assign quick bar buttons to skills and spells; previously, players could only assign two skills (one for each mouse button) and had to swap skills with the keyboard or mousewheel. Players can still assign specific attacks to mouse buttons.[22]Skill runes, another new feature, are skill modifiers that are unlocked as the player levels up. Unlike the socketable runes in Diablo II, skill runes are not items but instead provide options for enhancing skills, often completely changing the gameplay of each skill.[23] For example, one skill rune for the Wizard's meteor ability reduces its arcane power cost, while another turns the meteor to ice, causing cold damage rather than fire.As in Diablo II, Diablo III gives players the choice to make hardcore characters.[24] Players are required to first level up a regular character to level 10 before they have the option to create new Hardcore characters.[25] Hardcore characters cannot be resurrected; instead they become permanently unplayable if they are killed. Hardcore characters are separately ranked, and they can only form teams with other hardcore characters. After dying, the ghost of a hardcore character can still chat, the name still shows up in rankings, but the character cannot return to the game. If the hardcore character reached level 10 before dying, it can be placed in the Hall of Fallen Heroes.[26]Artisans are non-player characters (NPCs) who sell and craft. Two types of artisans can be introduced by completing a quest for each: Haedrig Eamon the Blacksmith and Covetous Shen the Jeweler. The Reaper of Souls expansion introduced the Mystic artisan, who can replace individual item enchantments and change the physical appearance of items. Artisans create items using materials the player can gather by scrapping acquired items and reducing them to their component parts. These materials are used to create items which will have random bonuses. Unlike Diablo II, rare and magic items can be enhanced, not just basic weaponry and armor. Crafting can also be used to train and improve the skills of the artisans rather than create new items. When artisans gain new levels, their shop reflects their higher skill level. The process of salvaging items into materials also makes inventory management easier. Blizzard stated that this crafting system was designed so that it would not slow down the pace of the game.[27]Followers are NPC allies that can accompany the player throughout the game world. There are three followers in Diablo III: Kormac the Templar, Lyndon the Scoundrel and Eirena the Enchantress, who each possess their own skills and background.[28] As followers fight alongside the player, they gain new experience, skills, and equipment as they level up. Only one follower accompanies the player at a time, creating a gameplay strategy decision. Originally, followers were only going to appear in Normal mode; however, Jay Wilson stated at BlizzCon 2011 that followers would continue to be usable in later difficulty levels.[29] Followers do not appear in co-op games nor against Diablo, as he will trap them in a cage of metal bones.On August 1, 2011, it was reported that Diablo III would feature two types of auction houses; one where players spend in-game gold and another where players could buy or sell virtual items for real-world money.[30] The real-money auction house was not available in Hardcore mode.[31]Prior to release, Blizzard stated that nearly everything that drops on the ground, including gold, could be traded with other players either directly or through the auction house system. Aside from certain bound on account items, such as the Staff of Herding needed to access the Whimsyshire easter egg, Blizzard stated there would be very few items that would be bound to a particular character and therefore un-tradable.[31]In order to get rated in South Korea, Blizzard had to remove the real-money auction house from the Korean release of the game as the auction house violated Korean anti-gambling laws.[32]In the gold-based auction house, a flat fee of 15 percent was taken from the final sale price of an auction. The real-money auction house fees were US$1, €1 or £1 (or equivalent) for equipment (weapons and armor) and 15 percent fee for commodity auctions, which included items like crafting materials, blacksmith and jewelcrafting plans, and gold exchange. There was an additional 15 percent \"cashing-out\" fee from proceeds gained selling items in the real-money auction house.[33]While the gold-based auction house was available to any player regardless of which region they play in, the real-money auction was restricted to players on their home region. If they used the global play function to play in a different region, they would not be able to access the real-money auction house.[34] The real money auction house was opened on June 12, 2012 (June 15 in the Americas).In March 2013, former Diablo III game director Jay Wilson stated that he felt the existence of the auction houses \"really hurt\" the game. \"I think we would turn it off if we could,\" Wilson said during his talk. But the problem is \"not as easy as that.\"[35][36][37]On September 17, 2013, Blizzard stated that both the gold and real-money auction houses would be shut down on March 18, 2014.[38] On March 18, 2014, Blizzard closed all the auction houses in Diablo III. Players had until June 24, 2014 to claim gold and items from the completed tab on the auction house interface.Player versus player combat (PvP) was added to Diablo III in a limited form with the 1.0.7 patch, in February 2013. The Brawling system provides a simple free for all area where between two and four characters can fight and defeat each other as long as they like, but without any scores or damage being tracked.[40] Players can participate by choosing from their existing characters, with access to all of the gear and skill they have gathered from playing the game in single-player or cooperative mode.PvP content for Diablo III had been discussed throughout the game's development, but on March 9, 2012, Blizzard announced that PvP had been delayed and would not be included with the game's release.[41] Lead designer Jay Wilson said in a post on Battle.net that the PvP Arena system would arrive in a post-release patch; it would include multiple Arena maps with themed locations and layouts, PvP-centric achievements, and a quick and easy matchmaking system. \"We'll also be adding a personal progression system that will reward you for successfully bashing in the other team's skulls\", Wilson added.On December 27, 2012, Blizzard announced that the previously mentioned Team Deathmatch or Arena mode was cancelled, because it did not have enough depth. Instead a simple PvP system would be added for the time being.[42] That PvP mode was initially named Dueling, and was renamed to Brawling before release.[43] Although the PvP systems initially outlined were not released, Blizzard stated that they will add other full-featured PvP systems in a future free content patch. In a May 2013 interview, Diablo III developer Wyatt Cheng stated that the development team was looking to see how the Brawling PvP evolves, while they \"continue to work on figuring out something more objective-based.\"[44]There are five available character classes from Diablo III and one from the Reaper of Souls expansion, for a total of six character classes; a seventh has been added in 2017.[45][46][151] In the previous two games, each class had a fixed gender, but in Diablo III players may choose the gender they would like to play.[16]The Archivist class was presented on April 1, 2009, following in Blizzard's April Fool's Day joke tradition.[54]The game takes place in Sanctuary, the dark fantasy world of the Diablo Series, twenty years after the events of Diablo II. Deckard Cain and Leah are in Tristram Cathedral (the same cathedral that was the setting of Diablo) investigating ancient texts regarding an ominous prophecy. A mysterious star falling from the sky strikes the Cathedral, creating a deep crater into which Deckard Cain disappears.The protagonist arrives in the town of New Tristram to investigate the falling star which struck the cathedral, which is now emanating risen undead. The protagonist accompanies Leah to the cathedral in order to rescue Cain from the crater into which he fell. After rescuing Cain, the protagonist learns that the only way to the fallen star is to defeat King Leoric, the former ruler of Khanduras known now as the 'Skeleton King'. Cain informs the protagonist that Leoric's crown must be recovered to defeat him, and the protagonist searches for Leoric's crown with the aid of Haedrig Eamon, the blacksmith of New Tristram. After recovering the crown, the protagonist returns to the cathedral where he/she eventually encounters and rescues Kormac, a warrior of the Templar order who has been taken captive by members of a cult known as the Dark Coven. Together, they defeat Leoric and find a stranger where the fallen star landed. The stranger's only memory is of a sword that shattered into three pieces as he fell.The protagonist recovers the sword pieces from the Khazra Den and the Drowned Temple, opposed by the witch Maghda, leader of the Dark Coven - giving aid to a bandit named Lyndon in retrieving a false relic in the process. Maghda, however, recovers the third piece before the protagonist does and attempts to force Cain to repair the sword. Leah, however, kills the cultists with a surge of magical power, forcing Maghda to kill Cain and flee with the stranger. Cain, before dying, repairs the sword and tasks the protagonist with returning it to the stranger, revealing that both the sword and the stranger are angelic. The protagonist pursues Maghda into the bowels of King Leoric's dilapidated torture chambers underneath his manor, rescuing the stranger and returning to him his sword after a violent fight with the Butcher, a powerful demon. The stranger's memories are recovered, and it is revealed that he is the Archangel Tyrael, the Aspect of Justice. Disgusted with his fellow angels' unwillingness to protect humanity from the forces of Hell, Tyrael casts aside his divinity to become a mortal and warn Sanctuary about the arrival of the demon lords Belial (Lord of Lies) and Azmodan (Lord of Sin).The protagonist, Leah, and Tyrael travel to the city of Caldeum. The protagonist leaves to track down Maghda at Alcarnus as per orders from Asheara, commander of the Iron Wolves (returning from Diablo II), while Leah and Tyrael search for evidence of Belial in the city sewers. The protagonist first encounters a young Enchantress who introduces herself as Eirena, who hails from a different era. With Eirena's help, the protagonist finds and stops cultists from channeling an illusion by halting their progress. Continuing on, the protagonist reaches the Khasim Outpost, finding that Belial's serpent demons have imprisoned and replaced the true guards. Freeing Captain Davyd and his men, the protagonist reclaims the Khasim Outpost from the serpent demons and is given access to Alcarnus. After freeing the prisoners, the protagonist fights Maghda in her lair and kills her, avenging Cain, then returns to Caldeum to rescue Leah from the grasp of the Imperial Guards. Gaining an audience with the young Emperor of Caldeum, Hakan II, the protagonist is blamed for the chaos at Alcarnus, and the Emperor orders the protagonist's death and that Leah be brought to him, forcing the protagonist to escape the palace. Escaping to the sewers, Leah reveals that her mother, Adria (the witch of Tristram from the original game) is still alive. The protagonist aids Leah in rescuing Adria from the city's sewers.Adria reveals that the key to stopping the forces of Hell is the Black Soulstone. Crafted by the deranged warlock Zoltun Kulle, it has the power to trap the souls of the seven Lords of Hell and destroy them forever. Leah explains that Kulle was slain by the Horadrim before he could put the finishing touches on the stone, and that his severed head was sealed off in the lush Dahlgur Oasis. Adria instructs the protagonist to find the warlock's head in the oasis if the Soulstone is to be retrieved. After the head is retrieved, Leah revives the ghost of Zoltun Kulle, and Tyrael instructs him to activate the Black Soulstone. Kulle states that two vials of his blood hidden by the Horadrim in the Desolate Sands are needed to reach the stone. Leah decides to accompany the protagonist whilst putting the warlock's head in the protagonist's packs. After recovering the two vials of blood, the protagonist ventures into Kulle's archives in search of his body, while Leah prepares the ritual to bring Kulle back. After Kulle is brought back to life, the protagonist is then led into the archive's inner sanctum where the Black Soulstone is located, but is forced to defeat Kulle when the resurrected warlock attempts to take the soulstone for himself. Upon returning to Caldeum, the protagonist finds the city under attack by Belial's forces. Leah and Adria fight their way to the palace with the protagonist, revealing Belial as having taken the form of the Emperor to deceive them, and eventually defeat him. Leah then traps Belial's soul within the Black Soulstone, freeing Caldeum, after which she has a vision of the demon lord Azmodan, who is invading Sanctuary from the crater of Mount Arreat (destroyed by Tyrael in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction) in order to retrieve the Black Soulstone and empower himself, becoming the Prime Evil.The protagonist travels to Bastion's Keep with Tyrael, their followers, Leah and Adria only to find it under attack by Azmodan's army. Tyrael instructs the protagonist to aid the defenders, lighting the signal fires on the keep's walls, and raising the catapults. With that done, the protagonist enters the stronghold, where Azmodan's forces have breached the lower levels, defeating the demon Ghom, the Lord of Gluttony. The protagonist then takes to the battlefield, destroying Azmodan's siege weapons and traveling to the crater of Mount Arreat. Tyrael assists the protagonist in reaching the demonic gate protecting the crater, and destroys it with his sword, El'druin. After a gruesome battle with a huge Siegebreaker Assault Beast, the protagonist traverses the depths of Arreat's inner core, destroying the Sin Hearts, which empower Azmodan and his armies. Azmodan's consort Cydaea, the Maiden of Lust, attempts to protect the hearts, but is defeated by the protagonist, who then confronts and defeats Azmodan. Leah seals Azmodan's soul within the Black Soulstone. With all seven Lords of Hell trapped within the stone, Tyrael states that the Eternal Conflict between Heaven and Hell will be ended if the stone is destroyed. The protagonist returns to Bastion's Keep, but finds that Adria has betrayed them. Adria reveals she has been serving Diablo from the beginning, and that Leah's father is Leoric's son Aidan, the Dark Wanderer (the Warrior player character from the first game and Diablo's reincarnate body in Diablo II), who was possessed by Diablo. Adria uses the Black Soulstone to resurrect Diablo while forcing Leah to serve as his vessel. With all the souls of the Lords of Hell now within him, Diablo becomes the Prime Evil, and begins an assault on the High Heavens.The protagonist arrives in the High Heavens to find that it is already under attack. Imperius, the Aspect of Valor, blames the protagonist and Tyrael for their downfall, causing Tyrael to give in to despair. On the other hand, the protagonist remains determined to fight, and defeats the demon Iskatu. The protagonist then meets Itherael, the Aspect of Fate, who instructs him to rescue Auriel, the Aspect of Hope, from Rakanoth, the Lord of Despair, in the Library of Fate. After rescuing Auriel and returning hope to the forces of Heaven, the protagonist is then instructed by Auriel to close the Hell Rifts. After this is done, the protagonist finds Tyrael, who has overcome his despair. Together, they attempt to stop Diablo from reaching the Crystal Arch, the source of power for the forces of Heaven, but not before a brawl with Izual, Tyrael's corrupted former lieutenant. After a long and fierce battle, Diablo is defeated and his physical manifestation is destroyed. The Black Soulstone is shown falling from the High Heavens, still intact. After the battle, Tyrael decides to rejoin the Angiris Council as the new Aspect of Wisdom, but remains a mortal, dedicated to building a permanent alliance between angels and humans.Development on Diablo III began in 2001 when Blizzard North was still in operation, and the game was first announced on June 28, 2008, at the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational in Paris, France. The original artistic design differed from that shown at Blizzard Worldwide Invitational 2008 demonstration, and had undergone three revisions before reaching the standards felt necessary by the team behind Diablo III. It was announced that the game would be simultaneously released on both Windows and Mac macOS platforms, and would require a constant internet connection to play, even for single-player mode.[55]The proprietary engine incorporates Blizzard's custom in-house physics, a change from the original usage of Havok's physics engine,[56] and features destructible environments with an in-game damage effect.Diablo III's lead designer was Jay Wilson, a former Relic Entertainment designer credited with work on Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War and Company of Heroes, as well as Blood II: The Chosen for Monolith Productions.[57] The lead world designer was Leonard Boyarsky, one of the six co-creators of Fallout.[58]Bobby Kotick from Activision announced in February 2012, that Diablo III would not launch in the 1st quarter of 2012; a slide show presentation at Activision's quarterly financial report listed the game's launch sometime in Q2 of 2012, and the release date of May 15, 2012, was announced on March 15, 2012.[6]On May 9, 2011, Blizzard announced that Diablo III was expected to be released for external beta testing in Q3 of 2011.[59] On September 7, 2011, Blizzard community manager Bashiok confirmed the start of the closed public beta test of the game with limited external testing by employees and their families. Testers were not restricted by a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) i.e. every participant would be free to show, share, or talk about any portion of the beta content.[60] On September 20, 2011, Blizzard announced through their Diablo III site that the closed beta test portion of the game through invites, promotions and giveaways had begun. On October 22, 2011, at BlizzCon, Diablo III game director Jay Wilson announced during an open Q&A that a new wave of beta invitations would be sent after an upcoming patch. Blizzard announced on April 19, 2012, that there would be an open beta weekend for the game, starting on April 20, 2012, and ending the morning of April 23.[61] The closed beta ended on May 1, 2012.The content available in the beta included the possibility to try all 5 character classes in the first act up to the Skeleton King encounter. The players were also able to try various in-game features such as crafting through the blacksmithing NPC, the auction house, hosting and joining public games as well as earning achievements.[62]The beta website made references that measures would be in place to prevent future cheating.[63]On June 11, 2012, it was announced at Apple's 2012 WWDC keynote that native Retina display support will be coming to Diablo III.[64] The following day, a Blizzard representative confirmed via the official Battle.net forums Apple's statement, the ongoing work by the developer on the optimization of the game engine for its rendering on the Retina display (and technically on other similar future high-density monitors) and that this optimization will be mainly for aesthetic purposes.[65]Patch 1.0.4 introduced the paragon leveling system. After reaching the level cap of 60, characters continue to accumulate experience points, gaining paragon levels (up to a cap of 100), each of which provides a bonus to core stats (making characters more powerful and durable) and magic find and gold find (increasing the quantity and average quality of loot drops).[66]Patch 1.0.5 expanded the difficulty settings with the addition of the Monster Power system. In addition to the Normal/Nightmare/Hell/Inferno difficulty system, players can also set Monster Power at any level from 0 to 10, with each level of Monster Power increasing the damage, health points, experience point yield and loot drop rates beyond the base value for a given difficulty tier.[67]The first PvP addition to the game was in February 2013, as part of patch 1.0.7; a simple free-for-all system called \"Brawling\" and multiple item crafting options.[40]On February 25, 2014, patch 2.0.1 was released, introducing extensive changes in preparation for the Reaper of Souls expansion, which was itself released on March 25.For Diablo's 20th anniversary, it was announced during BlizzCon 2016 that Diablo III would receive a free patch called The Darkening of Tristam that would recreate the original game. The patch will contain a 16-level dungeon, four main bosses from the 1996 version and special graphics filters and 8-directions limited movement like the original game. The patch is scheduled to release one week after the event, which happened on November 4, 2016.[153][154]On January 10, 2012, Blizzard community manager Bashiok tweeted \"Yup. Josh Mosqueira is lead designer for the Diablo III console project\" however a Blizzard spokesperson later clarified that Bashiok's tweet was only \"intended as a confirmation that Blizzard is actively exploring the possibility of developing a console version of Diablo III,\" adding, \"This is not a confirmation that Diablo III is coming to any console platform.\"[69]At Sony's Press Conference on February 20, 2013, Chris Metzen announced that Diablo III would release on both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.[4] Activision Blizzard stated in their first-quarter 2013 earnings report, that the PlayStation 3 version of Diablo III would be released in 2013.[70] On June 6, 2013, Blizzard announced that both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 port of the game would be released on September 3, 2013.[5] A PS3 version of the game was published and localized by Square Enix in Japan, released there on January 30, 2014.[71]In August 2013, Diablo III developers stated that they had started on the PlayStation 4 development of the game, titled Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition, and were looking at how to best utilize the new features of the PS4 controller, such as the TouchPad and the Share button. They are hopeful that characters from the PS3 version of Diablo III will be able to play directly on the PS4.[72] In May 2014, Blizzard announced that Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition would be released on August 19, bringing the game to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.[3] The game will run at 1080p on PlayStation 4 and, while it was initially announced to run at 900p on Xbox One, a day one patch will enable it to run at 1080p.[73][74] The consoles versions of Reaper of Souls added several new features exclusive to it, including the Nemesis System which will send a boss into your game that will hunt down your character specifically. If you defeat the boss you are awarded with a higher chance at legendary items, but if it kills your character it will come back, but stronger and also be transferred to another player on your friends list if you are online.Diablo III was released on May 15, 2012. Players had the options to buy one of two retail boxed versions, a standard edition and collector's edition, or could also pre-order directly from Battle.net and download the installer in advance. On May 14, 2012, players who bought the downloadable version from Battle.net could install the rest of the game including patches.[75] On May 15, 2012, the retail version could be bought from stores doing midnight launches such as GameStop. The Diablo III Battle.net servers went live at this point, people who downloaded the game could begin playing. Initially the launches were hindered by heavy server load with many users getting various errors, including the error 37 which reads; \"The servers are busy at this time. Please try again later\". These issues made the game unplayable for those affected, while some others experienced in-game bugs.[76] Despite assurances from Blizzard that the problems leading to the connection errors during Diablo III's launch had been resolved, Eurogamer reported on May 31, 2012, that these errors were still ongoing, and had reappeared after patch 1.0.2 was released for the game. Many fans complained that the ongoing problems had caused them to lose their hardcore (permanent death) characters.[78]In South Korea, players waited up to 36 hours to purchase the collector's edition.[79]The release was also the source of a minor controversy in Australia when retailer Game went into voluntary administration the day before the release, and so was unable to honor pre-orders or offer refunds.[80] In response to this, Blizzard Entertainment offered affected customers credit in purchasing the digital version of the game.[81]On April 23, 2015, the game was released in China as it was approved by the Ministry of Culture. It used to be sold under the name \"Big Pineapple\" (大菠萝 Dɑ Boluo) which sounds similar to Diablo in Mandarin Chinese in order to dodge the sales ban.[83]Starting at BlizzCon in October 2011, Blizzard offered an \"annual pass\" for World of Warcraft, where players who signed up for a 12-month subscription to that game received a free digital copy of Diablo III once released, as well as guaranteed beta access for the Mists of Pandaria expansion to World of Warcraft and a special Diablo-inspired mount called Tyrael's Charger in World of Warcraft.[84]A demo version of the game, called the Starter Edition, was released simultaneously with the full release. It provides a limited introduction to the game where players can complete Act 1 up to the Skeleton King boss encounter with a level cap of 13. Originally after Diablo III's release the Starter Edition was only available through a guest pass code, which was included with the boxed versions of the game. Players have the option to upgrade to the full game through their Battle.net accounts.[85] The Starter Edition became available to all users a few months after release on August 15, 2012.[86]Russell Brower was the primary composer of the music for Diablo III. Additional music was composed by Derek Duke, Glenn Stafford, Joseph Lawrence, Neal Acree, Laurence Juber & Edo Guidotti. When composing for the orchestra, Brower tried to respect the Wagnerian style from the expansion to the second game in the series, Lord of Destruction.[5] The Overture is considered the main theme of the game and it has been performed by the Eminence Symphony Orchestra, and was released on iTunes in 2009, as a single. A similar composition was used in the cinematic teaser trailer of the game. The Tristram theme from the first Diablo, also used in the second game, is present in Diablo III with some changes.. Irish choral ensemble Anúna also feature on the soundtrack. Brower stated that \"Working somewhat against conventional expectations, Hell is a beautiful and seductive sound, provided by Dublin’s uniquely astounding choral group ANÚNA\".[89] A full soundtrack was released on iTunes on May 15, 2012 (the same day the game was released), as well as part of the Collector's Edition of the game.On August 21, 2013, it was announced at the German games fair Gamescom that Diablo III: Reaper of Souls would be the first expansion for Diablo III. It features the fallen angel of wisdom Malthael as the expansion's main villain and is set in the city of Westmarch, which takes inspiration from many Gothic medieval locations. The expansion includes a new hero called the Crusader, an increased level cap to level 70, major improvements to loot drops including the ability to change item stats using an enchanting system, the ability to change the look of an item using transmogrification, and an improved Paragon leveling system which is account-wide and does not have a level cap.[90]Reaper of Souls was released on March 25, 2014, for the Windows and macOS versions of Diablo III.[91] The expansion pack content was released as part of the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition version for consoles on August 19 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.[3] That edition expanded the base Diablo III game on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and brought the game for the first time to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.Diablo III has received positive reviews from critics, attaining scores of 88% and 88/100 on aggregate review websites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively.[94][98]GamesRadar was positive about the game's opening act and its nods to past Diablo games saying \"we liked what we saw.\"[105]IGN was positive about the new skill system stating \"Instead of gameplay like Diablo II, where I often regretted how I allotted my ability points, Diablo III encourages experimentation and finding out exactly what works for your play-style. It's a vastly superior way to handle character abilities\", and praised the overall gameplay, stating \"the new systems really do make it a lot easier to enjoy Diablo III\".[112] IGN further praised the game's new gameplay design, in particular the rune and loot systems, the randomly generated levels and the game's enjoyable unpredictability. It stated the game's feel is quite intuitive and also praised the game's sound and voicing.[113]Rock, Paper, Shotgun gave mixed commentary during the game's beta period, praising the actual game itself by stating that it is much more direct than its predecessors and intuitive in its interface. However, it said the playing experience is spoiled due to lag in single-player mode caused by a lack of an offline single-player mode.[114] Following the game's release, it reaffirmed its displeasure at the always-online DRM and offered a mixed opinion that the game was enjoyable but added \"nothing new\" to its genre.[115]Users have voiced criticism about the game's strong digital rights management which requires what is known as persistent online authentication, resulting in the lack of an offline single-player mode.Erik Kain, a Forbes contributing writer, stated that the requirement to remain online is not necessary for single-player mode and that Blizzard is abusing its position as a \"juggernaut\" and is setting a worrying precedent for the gaming industry. In response to questions about the lack of offline single-player, Diablo III senior producer Alex Mayberry said, \"Obviously StarCraft II did it, World of Warcraft authenticates also. It's kind of the way things are, these days. The world of gaming is not the same as it was when Diablo II came out.\"Gaming Blend supported the game's fanbase (referring to the user ratings on Metacritic and Amazon) and rejected counter-criticisms of the community. It claims that the gaming industry at large is far too defensive of production companies' actions, to the point of accepting backward steps in game availability. William Usher, the article's author said, \"Journalists should have been acknowledging consumer distaste rather than fueling it with pro-corporate pandering.\"[117]While Gaming Blend disliked the always-online DRM, it did give the game a positive review. It stated the game includes interesting opportunities for experimentation and has great appeal for replaying over and over. The review concluded the game is \"smooth and entertaining.\"[118] A GameArena critic questioned how Blizzard managed to \"fail so spectacularly at creating reliable networking for Diablo 3\" before going on to point out the lack of competitive multiplayer.[13]Many users criticized the art direction as it was considered too bright and colourful in contrast to the darker atmosphere of the previous releases. This led to petitions demanding Blizzard to change the design. The lead producer responded to these criticisms and explaining the design choices by stating that \"We feel that color actually helps to create a lot of highlights in the game so that there is contrast.\" He also highlighted that unlike the previous games, the players explore outdoors.[13]The Black Soulstone footage won the 'Outstanding Visual Effects in an Animated Commercial or Video Game Trailer' award from the Visual Effects Society.[13][13]Before its release, Diablo III broke several presale records and became the most pre-ordered PC game to date on Amazon.com.[123] Activision Blizzard reported that Diablo III had broken the one-day PC sales records, accumulating over 3.5 million sales in the first 24 hours after release and over 6.3 million sales in its first week, including the 1.2 million people who obtained Diablo III through the World of Warcraft annual pass.[124] On its first day, the game amassed 4.7 million players worldwide, an estimate which includes those who obtained the game via the World of Warcraft annual pass.[124] In its 2012 second quarter report, Diablo III was reported to have pushed Activision Blizzard's expectations and as of July 2012, more than 10 million people had played the game.[13] Diablo III remains the fastest selling PC game to date, and also one of the best-selling PC video games. As of the end of 2012, it had sold more than 12 million copies,[9] and as of March 2013, Blizzard stated that Diablo III had around 1 million daily players, with 3 million unique players each month.[126] As of May 2013, Diablo III had been played by 14.5 million unique players, according to Blizzard's released statistics.[13] As of February 2014, the game had sold 15 million copies across all platforms.[13] As of June 30, 2014, Diablo III and Reaper of Souls had combined sales worldwide of more than 20 million copies.[22] As of June 30, 2015, the game had sold, along with Reaper of Souls, 30 million units.[130]On May 28, 2012, Blizzard Entertainment's offices in South Korea were raided by the Fair Trade Commission amid allegations that the company had breached consumer rights laws, including suspected violations of Korea's law on electronic commerce and commercial contracts. Players in Korea requested refunds from Blizzard based on their inability to play Diablo III, but Blizzard cited the terms of sale and refused to grant these requests. Hundreds of gamers filed formal complaints with the FTC,[131][132][133] and in June 2012 Blizzard started offering players full refunds.[134]On June 15, 2012, French consumers group UFC Que Choisir announced that it had received 1,500 complaints in four days regarding connectivity issues with Diablo III.[135] As a result of this, the organization asked Blizzard Entertainment to provide a permanent solution by June 30, 2012, and to \"communicate completely and transparently about problems encountered in due time\". They also requested that gamers be given reimbursement for any troubles they may have encountered. In addition, they asked the French government to take a closer look at games with online-only DRM.[136] On June 28, Blizzard replied to the Que Choisir that the box for Diablo III clearly labelled that a high-speed internet connection was required and that most of the stability issues had been fixed.[137]The German Federation of Consumer Organizations threatened legal action if Blizzard did not respond to complaints about Diablo III's lack of clear information on the German version of the box by July 27, 2012, regarding the always online requirement and lack of ability to resell the digital game.[138][139]May 15, 2012 (2012-05-15)Video game soundtrack77:46Azeroth Music1.\"And The Heavens Shall Tremble\"Russell Brower, Derek Duke, Glenn Stafford, Joseph Lawrence, Neal Acree, Laurence Juber & Edo Guidotti2:242.\"The Eternal Conflict\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti2:373.\"New Tristram\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti5:164.\"Demon Hunter\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti2:595.\"Black Soulstone\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti2:486.\"Azmodan\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti1:597.\"Witch Doctor\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti1:188.\"Tamoe Highlands\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti4:189.\"I Am Justice\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti1:5710.\"Barbarian\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti0:5811.\"Arreat\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti3:5612.\"Leoric\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti8:1113.\"Monk\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti1:2814.\"Incantation\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti2:1815.\"Bastion's Keep\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti7:3116.\"Wizard\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti1:1717.\"Caldeum\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti7:1118.\"Evil Reawakened\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti3:3019.\"Garden of Hope\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti3:2520.\"Heaven's Gate\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti2:4321.\"A Tenuous Bond\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti4:5022.\"A New Dawn\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti2:2723.\"Leah\"Brower, Duke, Stafford, Lawrence, Acree, Juber, & Guidotti2:36Total length:77:46",
      "They're not quite ready yet. If you had an account with the old site, don't worry - it will be transferred over.By Martin Gaston  •  18 May 2012  •  Posted in ReviewsYou know what they say: you just can't keep a good millennia-old demonic evil down, but you can keep him dormant for 11 years.Diablo is, and always has been, an excuse to gobble up loot and click on nasty bad things wrapped in a lore built with sweeping brush strokes; a war of good versus evil, angels and demons, yadda yadda yadda. But what an excuse Diablo III is, smooshing together things like typecast usage of Jennifer Hale and Claudia Black, doing the exact kind of roles that Jennifer Hale and Claudia Black do, with some ridiculously expensive CGI interludes and that unstoppable march of click, click, click.Diablo III is a very good game, and it's one that positively delights in being a gamey game. More than anything else, Blizzard's latest is a victory for the diligent systems engineers that have pumped the studio's bottomless resources into their unwavering dedication for lean finesse and steady focus, culminating in a sweeping, masterful crescendo of clicks and clinks as mathematical precision meets an army of demons so dense it stretches off into the horizon.This is, essentially, a quest for numbers - keeping yours high, augmenting them with number-riddled items, and whacking everybody else's to zero. There are four acts, five classes, and after completing the game in 22 hours and with 11,000 kills I'm barely past the starting gates of Blizzard's latest far-reaching descent through the multi-layered dungeons of Diablo's latest hellspawn.It's a dungeon crawler that simply refuses to crawl, and Blizzard has designed a game so taut it lends itself perfectly to those simple ludic pleasures I sometimes worry the industry is quick to forget. Any ounce of fat on the series' bones has been sheared off, leaving you with a game that places you instantly and permanently within its loops of tight combat and expansive levelling economics. Blizzard's oft-imitated original template gave you myriad hoops to jump through - get a scroll to identify this, make sure you've got enough of that, then spend more time reading up on character builds on the internet than you'll actually spend playing - but Diablo III opts for less restriction and far more flexibility.A litany of tweaks and changes helps keep your loot, complete with resplendent titles like Socketed Flanged Mace of the Bear, wading through enemies across the game's randomly generated dungeons. There's always teleports at the end of a dungeon, the UI makes scrolling through everything a cinch, and the game is perfectly balanced in a way that perpetually keeps you driving forward as old areas are quickly scaled into insignificance. This statistical precision is achieved, in part, by the game's fixed distribution of statistics as characters level up, allowing the actual dungeons to be crafted with laser-sharp precision.Players opt for a mix of melee, support abilities and magic across the five classes of Wizard, Witch Doctor, Demon Hunter, Barbarian and Monk. Each class has its own meter for special abilities, replacing the traditional mana bar, and each has had its suite of tactics expertly designed. There are plenty of detailed skills across the quintet, with sumptuous accompanying animations; things like forked lightning, teleportation, spinning blades, earthquakes and even a plague of toads. A plague of chuffing toads. Blizzard's focus is to make your characters cool, refusing to compromise on the raw offensive power of fan-favourite series spells, like Meteor, and instead opting to power everything else up to compensate.Everything is kept purposefully non-committal, and players can reshuffle their action bar at a moment's notice without any penalty other than a brief cooldown. Each skill can also be further tailored with the addition of runes, which can also be swapped around and modify the effects of your abilities; for instance, the Monk's shield, Serenity, can be set to explode at the end of its duration. This versatile range of runes, which are masterfully doled out in pitch-perfect clumps as you progress through the ranks so as not to be overwhelming, are Diablo III's greatest success, and they open up opportunities for customisation that are far more visual, immediate and fun than dumping numbers into a stat sheet or slowly progressing down a one-way skill tree.So rigorous is this constant loop of unlocks, upgrades and drops that you'll almost always be obtaining or unlocking something and keeping your next upgrade in mind. Even a pair of shopkeepers can be boosted through regular cash (and later item) investments, hinting towards an end game where you forge your own high-level equipment.For erstwhile aficionados, this is a game that begets multiple playthroughs, as characters advance through Normal, Nightmare, Hell and (the new) Inferno difficulties. In this sense the game becomes a fairground ride, as players run back to the front of the game for another go, and Blizzard's design focus is clearly to welcome back its players time and time again with open arms. As the risk ramps up so do the rewards, and the addition of Inferno difficulty should help calm expert players incensed by Blizzard tailored tweaks that initially render the Diablo III experience a complete doddle.Variety is also added into these procedurally-generated dungeons thanks to a set of mini-quests that perch alongside the 31 main quests. These help alleviate the frustrations that come from poking through the fog of war and unearthing absolutely nothing, and now your idle exploration is occasionally rewarded with additional lore and events.This is now Blizzard's most immediately accessible franchise, lacking the accelerated chaos of eSports darling Starcraft II or the terrifying sprawl of World of Warcraft. But Blizzard's seven-year reign of the MMO genre has not escaped Diablo III, and this new, modern Blizzard brings in plenty of recognisable elements from its gaming giant - World of Warcraft's fingerprints are all over this. Immediately noticeable is a slightly cheerier art direction, complete with cartoonish character models, that adds degrees of hue and saturation not found in previous games.Yet Diablo III is still a tremendously dark game, and by blending these bold colours with rich, busy details, an impressively diverse range of enemies and a lavish focus on background animations Blizzard has produced a visual treat that runs well on even low-spec systems. It's a bit of a shame, though, that the third game is in the thrall of its predecessors; an opening jaunt through New Tristram is riddled with understandable callbacks, but this nostalgic goodwill departs when the second act takes you to an area reminiscent of Diablo II's second act, Lut Gholein. Thankfully the pace (and aesthetic) picks up for Diablo 3's conclusion, but the disappointing second act drags somewhat in a game that is otherwise perfectly executed.The game's underlying Battle.net infrastructure, which requires an always-on Internet connection, reveals a studio that's now gotten so used to its players being permanently connected that it's wholly unprepared to let go. These interconnected services, when they function, are at the very least capable of impressing - the speed and ease of which you can hop into an online game with one of your friends almost forgives a clumsy and unwieldy BattleTag ID system, and the slick integration of an auction house (which I assumed I'd hate) makes tailoring your hero just how you want them that little bit easier.Blizzard's argument that Diablo III is a better game in co-op is also true, allowing for more specialised builds against buffed enemy forces, and it's easy to see how the system is a good idea when it works. But it's bloody frustrating when it doesn't, and we've seen the system crumble in launch week, and even days later the game hasn't quite recovered from the initial frenzy. I just don't believe the Internet is as stable as Blizzard thinks it is.A few threads are left dangling in the game's campaign, almost certainly to be properly tugged in further updates and expansion packs. Right now Diablo III is more refined than it is brave, and while the future might bring the thrill of new additions it is clear Blizzard's current intent is to advance this now-crowded genre by polishing its set of core mechanics until they shine as bright as the sun.This is not the most adventurous action RPG on the market, then, but its razor-sharp and uncompromising focus on structure and mechanics ensures it's one of the most playable. Diablo III quite simply revels in being a video game, and when a game is this well-executed it's impossible to resist those charms.Version Tested: PC[video]12257[/video]",
      "Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo revolutionized the computer role-playing game genre in 1996. While the game retained the fantasy trappings, loot reward systems, and experience progression mechanics of other RPGs, Diablo introduced fast-paced real-time combat to the mix. In addition, maps in Diablo were procedurally generated, meaning every player would experience a slightly different challenge. This kept the game fresh even for players who had poured dozens of hours into the title. Diablo, its Hellfire expansion, its sequel Diablo II, and that game's Lord of Destruction expansion were all smash hits for the still-young studio.The most recent game in the series, Diablo III in 2012 (along with its later expansions), continued the series' amazing track record. With over 30 million units sold across PCs and consoles, it ranks as one of the best-selling games of all time. Clearly, the market likes going to hell. As one of Blizzard's core properties, there's no doubt that a Diablo 4 is either in discussion or actively in the works at the Irvine, CA studio.And yet, for all that, it may not be coming anytime soon. Blizzard is one of the most unique developers in the industry, willing and able to iterate through different design prototypes for ages. Where any other studio would want to crank out a sequel for a quick buck, Blizzard has other priorities, and they are keeping Diablo 4 from your screens for the next little while. Here's why Blizzard won't release it — yet.Blizzard will spend more time crafting a game than nearly any other company in the industry, even if that means working on a single game for over a decade. The Diablo II expansion Lord of Destruction arrived in 2001, and like its predecessors, set the gaming world on fire with its slick design and wicked atmosphere. The team behind the franchise, Blizzard North, figured one expansion was enough, and thus began working on the next full release in the franchise. And they worked on it. And worked on it. And worked on it some more.For reasons that have never been publicly explained, Blizzard headquarters then decided to shutter their North branch in 2005. Along with that closure, they also decided to cancel all of the work that had been done on the new Diablo game up to that time. The Irvine crew formed a brand-new team to build a new Diablo III from scratch. This game would not see the light of day until 2012, fully seven years after the restart, which itself was begun four years after the original project.Blizzard has been blessed with a lot of success, so they have enough resources to pour into a single title over this kind of time. And with Diablo III, they proved they were willing to do so. So just because that game turned out to be a blockbuster doesn't mean that Diablo 4 is right around the corner. After all, it's only been a few years since the third game released. To Blizzard, that's less than the blink of an eye.So why does Blizzard spend so much time on development? Because for them, anything that isn't absolutely perfect won't do. Since the release of the original Warcraft: Orcs & Humans in 1994, the company has built up a reputation for the highest levels of innovation and quality. Their games aren't just 'good,' and they are not just 'influential': they are polished masterpieces that either define or redefine their genres. World of Warcraft. StarCraft. Overwatch. Hearthstone. It's a remarkable legacy.But even this studio can't strike solid gold every time. Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans was intended to be Blizzard's foray into the adventure game space. But once the project was effectively complete, it wasn't a genre-leading title: it was just another game. Blizzard wouldn't accept that, and cancelled a complete game that was ready to be released and earn money. Very few companies would ever think to do such a thing.They repeated this trick a few years later with StarCraft: Ghost, a brilliant-looking action game that, much like its protagonist, vanished before our eyes. And of course, there was that original version of Diablo III, which probably would have been another smash hit if Blizzard had only released it. Instead, they cancelled it, and spent another seven years crafting a different game with the same name.In other words, Blizzard's reputation — not games — is their core product. Anything that might, just might, harm it is cancelled or restarted. So they don't care if Diablo 4 is really great and ready to release soon; they would sooner start over from scratch and make it perfect.Eleven years, who knows how many dollars, and an endless amount of hype all resulted in one thing: the long-awaited release of Diablo III worldwide on May 15, 2012. Needless to say, old-school fans had been looking forward to this moment for over a decade. Even new players who loved Blizzard products were excited to try out the company's latest adventure. They bought the game. They installed it. They hit \"Play.\"But they lost to the ultimate boss: Error 37.This was the internal error code for a failure to connect to Blizzard's servers, a pervasive problem upon the game's release. Even though Diablo III had a single-player mode, everyone had to connect to the servers for some reason. And in this case, that meant a whole lot of people couldn't even play the product they'd just purchased. It took weeks for Blizzard to sort out the mess, but by then, a bad taste had been left in the mouths of a lot of dedicated fans. Blizzard's sterling reputation had taken a dent.Meanwhile, the game's Auction House system also turned out to be a problem. Intended to allow players to easily share loot they didn't want, for money if they so chose, the system instead ruined the overall progression path of the game. Eventually, the system was removed from the game altogether. Another failure for a company that hated that word.For Diablo 4, Blizzard will want to ensure a smooth player experience, and make sure any problematic systems are cut out before release. That'll take time. And Blizzard, of all companies, won't hesitate to wait if it means getting the game right.The main campaign for Diablo III isn't wildly long, and even inexperienced players can probably complete it in 15 to 20 hours. In theory, then, this should be the kind of game that you pick up, play, and then put down forever. Not so! Many players have logged hundreds of hours in Diablo III, and keep coming back for more. There are a lot of reasons for this, but one of the biggest is a system called Seasons.Essentially, a Season is a game-mode that only lasts for a certain period of time. During a Season, a player who opts into the mode will have to start a brand-new character from scratch. This has the effect of setting everyone back to square one: at the start of a Season, everybody runs un-leveled, un-geared heroes again. Blizzard then sets a number of challenges for them to complete, and it's a race to see who among the community, or who among your friends, can complete them first. Since everybody's starting from the same point, the race is one that anyone can win. Meanwhile, Season-specific rewards can only be earned during this period, and never again, so players are incentivized to try to play as much of each Season as they can.This long-running system has proven to be very popular, and it keeps an old game alive in the hearts of millions of players. Blizzard doesn't need Diablo 4 to keep the brand thriving: Diablo III is doing that work just fine all by itself, even years after its release.When the original Diablo burst onto the scene in 1996, it transformed what an action game could be. Fast-paced yet tactical, easy to pick up yet difficult to master, it was a near-perfect distillation of everything action games aspired to become, while simultaneously preserving everything that made RPG games such a sensation. The game led the industry forward, and with Diablo II, was a major factor in bringing games into the 21st Century.For all its massive success, Diablo III hasn't been nearly as influential. The third game in the franchise retained the top-down, isometric look of its '90s predecessors, keeping the camera way back from the action. While there are other indie titles that use that style as well, usually as an intentional throwback to a bygone era of gaming, there are no AAA experiences that currently use that format. Modern titles, such as God of War or Middle-Earth: Shadow of War, keep the camera close to the main character and the immediate environment. Rather than giving the player a bird's eye view, these games present a visceral ground-level experience. That also allows for far greater detail in the character models and the animations.Diablo 4, then, will have to reconcile the classic franchise format with these more modern tropes, without alienating old-school fans or potential new players. Otherwise, Diablo will not be a genre-defining series anymore, just a kind of updated relic from another time. Blizzard has no interest in rehashing the past: they want to shape the future. And they will take as much time as they need to hit on a design that does.As mentioned above, Blizzard takes an awful long time making their games. But there's a flip side to that coin: Blizzard has been supporting their active roster for longer and longer. StarCraft II is still getting attention from the company, even seven years after its release. World of Warcraft continues its astonishing run, even though it was released all the way back in 2004. And by all indications, Overwatch and its new eSports league is going to be around for a long, long time to come.To that end, Diablo 4 can't just be a fun game: it needs to be able to support an active fanbase for years. Blizzard may even possibly be looking to make it a long-running game-as-a-service, in which case it may be the only new Diablo game for a decade or more. Building a title that can stand up to that long test of time, and have the infrastructure necessary to constantly push new content, is no small feat: just ask the team that turned the failed Titan project into Overwatch.While the Seasons system in Diablo III has allowed fans to remain engaged with that game, a full-on service-oriented title is a whole new ballgame. Wedding the game-as-a-service philosophy with the tried-and-true Diablo formula will take a lot of care, attention, and, most of all, time. Plus, building out the systems necessary to maintain such a game over the long term is a large endeavor unto itself. Diablo 4 likely won't be the next Diablo III: it will be, in many respects, a bold new direction for the franchise.In 2016, Diablo III lost its director, Josh Mosqueira. Since taking the reins in 2013, Mosqueira had led many of the face-saving initiatives that rescued the game from itself, such as removing the Auction House. He would naturally be the man to lead the franchise into its next installment. But his departure left a hole behind him, and his replacement would have to get up to speed on the still-ongoing Diablo III before tackling a new project. At a bare minimum, this would have slowed down development, and further added to the production schedule.Interestingly, while Blizzard has almost certainly hired a new director, nobody really knows for sure! The company never announced if the role was ever filled, or who filled it. Is this person a veteran member of the Diablo III team? A talented director poached from another studio? A mysterious wanderer with a dark past, hellbent on revenge and redemption? We don't know! Whoever it is, that person will have a lot of work to do, and a massive legacy to live up to, and of course, Blizzard's reputation to manage. It's a lot of responsibility. And the best way to handle that responsibility is patience, and time.Which is yet another reason you won't be seeing Diablo 4 for a while yet.",

      "Diablo III is an incredible action game from Blizzard Entertainment, available on Xbox One and PC. Not only does it fully support online and offline cooperative play, but it keeps seeing new features, content updates, and more, giving the game some serious longevity.The previous DLC, Reaper of Souls, was a full-blown story expansion, complete with new characters, new cut-scenes, and an all-new hero class, the Crusader. The Necromancer DLC is nowhere near as beefy.For $15, you get the all-new, fully-voiced Necromancer class, a series staple from Diablo II, and various cosmetic items. The DLC's launch also saw the addition of new areas for adventure mode and other new challenges for end-game players, all of which are free to existing players.So, is the Necromancer DLC worth it? Read on, friends.Straight up, the Necromancer is overpowered right now, so if you want to get in on the carnage, do so quickly. Blizzard will nerf this boney dude any moment.What makes the Necromancer overpowered? It's a combination of things, but thankfully Diablo III has near-perpetual scaling difficulty, allowing you to ramp up the difficulty every time you start feeling too powerful.As of this writing, I'm level 60 on my Necromancer, playing on Torment III difficulty. I deal so much damage and have so many minions that I can tear through huge groups of enemies in seconds, never taking agro myself. The skeletal archers, knights, and risen dead do that for me. It's so much fun.The Necromancer uses \"essence\" as its primary resource, which builds up using primary attacks. Some of these include a ghostly scythe slash, bone spikes from beneath the ground, and blood siphoning (which also heals you). You can spend essence on more powerful attacks, including the summoning of skeletal mages, the spreading of debilitating curses, and various other diabolical abilities.The Necromancer, like other classes, has a full complement of abilities, passive skills, and modifiers, allowing you to tailor your playstyle in all sorts of ways. You could play a bone-armored Necromancer who gets up close and personal, using ghostly scythes and other melee-range abilities. You could focus on minions and build up huge armies of undead creatures, which follow you around and do your bidding. You could even ditch minions all together and focus on necromantic ranged attacks.For my Necromancer, I'm leaning heavily on the class's other resource: corpses. When playing as a Necromancer, every time an enemy dies, a corpse spawns and becomes available to manipulate in various ways. You can make them explode, dealing area damage. You can devour them, to restore health. You can resurrect them, to add to your army, or leverage a combination of abilities.I'm using a build that generates additional corpses when my summoned or controlled minions die. Then, I use \"corpse lance\" to transform the bones of the fallen into giant spikes, which deal huge amounts of damage. The downside is, of course, that I'm a total glass cannon. If an elite mob even looks at me funny, I evaporate. The Necromancer has plenty of survival tools, I just wanted to see how much damage I could get out of this guy.In the midst of a field of corpses, I've been able to fell bosses incredibly quickly by sending dozens of corpse lances flying at the target, modified to deal stacking damage. It feels like something Blizzard will adjust, eventually, but for now, playing the Necromancer is hilariously powerful and satisfying.There seems to be a missed opportunity somewhere here for the Necromancer to have been part of a larger DLC. You have to wonder if the new areas Blizzard patched into the game for free were originally slated to be part of a larger effort.The Necromancer DLC isn't cheap at $15, considering all you get is a new class and some cosmetics. The Necromancer is fully voiced, and has some of his or her own cutscenes, dialogue and armor types throughout the whole game, though. The art effort alone is pretty large for the Necromancer, and he feels as much a part of the base game as any other class.That said, I can't help but wonder why some aspects of the Necromancer's inclusion couldn't be more fleshed out. For Reaper of Souls, for example, Blizzard added a ton of lore tomes to give greater context to the new Crusader class. Every now and then the Necromancer will mention the Priests of Rathma, and the \"balance\" between life and death. But the DLC leaves you hungry for more information on the Necromancer's ethos and motivations that don't seem present in-game.Blizzard could have done a little more to help slot the Necromancer into the game's world too. It's jarring when the kids of Caldeum seem completely at ease with the fact that a dude just walked into their city, followed by an army of undead and a grotesque flesh golem. For the Death Knight DLC in World of Warcraft, Blizzard added some negative NPC reactions to the Death Knight's presence as you walked through the major cities, enhancing the overall fantasy of the class.Diablo III's Necromancer plugs a hole in the heart of long-time fans of the franchise, who wished for the return of the Diablo II staple. It brings a huge amount of versatility, allowing for solo play, ranged damage, support, and melee, with beautifully rendered armor sets to compensate. The voice acting is well realized, and the Necromancer is just so damn fun to play and learn.At $15, I would've liked to have seen a little more story content, even if it was just some additional lore, but that's a personal gripe. Most players will probably be too busy relishing the bloody carnage the Necromancer can bring, which is considerable. This is a great addition to Diablo III, one I highly recommend to fans of all of Diablo's existing classes.",
      "Diablo III is a hack 'n slash RPG that focuses on loot collection and improving your character. It's set in a world overrun by demons called Sanctuary and only you can stop the demon threat.Diablo III is very simple, requiring very little to no planning to succeed. You create a character, pick a skill and just progress through the game while occasionally upgrading your equipment. You can change skills and any stat points you've earned without penalties. You can also choose from one of the 17 difficulty levels, so you can always play at a level that's challenging but not too stressful. All of this creates a game that you can enjoy without worrying about messing up in the long run.One of the better parts of Diablo III is collecting the piles of gold, the colorful gems, and various pieces of equipment. It's especially exciting when a legendary quality item drops from a monster since it makes a distinct sound effect and shoots a beam of orange/green light into the sky. So whenever a lot of legendary items drop all at once it just feels incredibly satisfying.There are more than 50 distinct class/skill combinations, including ranged builds, melee builds, support builds, defensive builds, pure-offense builds, and many more. You're sure to find a build that you'll enjoy playing, whether you prefer to play alone or with friends.The endgame in Diablo III consists of only two things – completing bounties and clearing greater rifts. Both of these have very little variation in them, so quite often you'll run through the same map layouts, clear the same enemies, and complete the same objectives. This gets extremely stale after long play sessions and can cause you not to pick up the game again.Are you sure that you want to abandon your hard work?",
      "What a great article. 10/10An excellent read! Well done.These sorts of decisions are why Blizzard is still held in such high regard.\nThey might be just as businessy as anyone else (they are Activision after all), but they understand that as long as they commit to quality irrespective of time scales involved, their brand will sell games.\nAnd really, how many companies branding is enough to guarantee sales these days? Maybe Nintendo? I can't think of any other major examples.Blizzard, Nintendo and Valve are the three companies that spring to my mind.Buy my book/10I love bliz, they can do no wrong in my eyes. I got caught by the GAME insolvency and lost my collectors edition of D3 I had fully paid off.Bliz was kind enough to upgrade my account, apologised for not being able to supply the physical items, and credited my account the difference between the standard and collectors editions.D3 died. im waitting for D4 hopfuly that will be done right, D2 is more active.Wow what a great insight. This excerpt really nails how D3 has evolved. I played briefly pre- reaper of souls and loot 2.0 and i just couldnt get into it like i could diablo 2. I liked it but i just thought i was done with this kind of game. The 4 legendaries that i managed to roll after playing for weeks that i couldn't use didnt help either. Fast forward to the current era and its a completely better game. Adventure mode really saved it + all the other enhancements they've added and im finally hooked. Great read and now a great game.How they fixed Diablo 3: They got rid of Jay \"Fuck that loser\" Wilson.Awesome article, really enjoyed it... And may have to give Diablo III another crack since I last tried it back after and 'til a month or so after initial launch![Please don't use \"addicting\", at least not as an adjective, when you want \"addictive\". It's a funny meme *because* of it being wrong... Language adapts and all that, so let's not make it right, especially in print form :-P]They didnt save it... They turned it into something the fans didnt like, but the masses loves.\"What became apparent to Blizzard in the coming months was that people were more interested in gaming Diablo 3 than they were in playing it\"... What does this even mean? xDPlease log in or register to gain access to this feature."

    "title": "Don't Starve",
    "text": [
      "Don't Starve is an open world survival video game developed by the Canadian indie company Klei Entertainment. The game was initially released via Valve Corporation's Steam software for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on April 23, 2013. A PlayStation 4 port, renamed Don't Starve: Giant Edition, became available the following year (with PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 3 versions released on September 2014 and June 2015 respectively, and an Xbox One version released in August 2015). Don't Starve for iOS, renamed Don't Starve: Pocket Edition was released on July 9, 2015. Android version was released on October 20, 2016. Downloadable content titled Reign of Giants was released on April 30, 2014, and a multiplayer expansion called Don't Starve Together became free for existing users on June 3, 2015. A Nintendo Switch port came out on April 12, 2018.[1]\nThe game follows a scientist named Wilson who finds himself in a dark, dreary world and must survive as long as possible. To this end, the player must keep Wilson healthy, fed, and mentally stable as he avoids a variety of surreal and supernatural enemies that will try to kill and devour him. The game's Adventure mode adds depth to the sparse plot and pits Wilson against the game's antagonist, Maxwell.\nDon't Starve was Klei's first foray into the survival genre. Conceived during the height of a game industry trend of dropping players into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival, the game was influenced by Minecraft, which spearheaded this trend, as well as by filmmaker Tim Burton. The game received positive reviews from critics, commended for its original art style, music, and variety of ways for the player to die, although its high level of difficulty and implementation of permanent death were less warmly received.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDon't Starve is an action-adventure game with a randomly generated open world and elements of survival and roguelike gameplay. Combat is handled by  pointing and clicking with the mouse, while other activities are controlled by the keyboard, or using the inbuilt gamepad support to play using a controller, giving it a console-like gameplay feel. The goal is to survive as long as possible, and a count of the number of days the player has survived is shown onscreen. The game keeps few records of player progress besides the total number of experience points and the playable characters unlocked. Wilson is the default playable character, unlocked upon purchase of the game, but the next character, Willow, can be unlocked with 160 experience points. Woodie, the last character unlockable with experience, requires the game's limit of 1,600. The player earns 20 experience points each in-game day and receives them after dying. As is common among roguelikes, death is permanent, barring the use of several rare or expensive items like the Meat Effigy, TouchStone, and Life-Giving Amulet.The game relies on a day/night cycle that causes meaningful fluctuations in gameplay style. During the day, the player spends most of their time exploring the world: gathering food, firewood, and other resources, discovering crafting recipes to combine available items, and avoiding enemies. With nightfall comes dangerous monsters and an invisible menace, Charlie, who attacks the player when the screen is dark. A player must have a light source or night vision to prevent Charlie from attacking. Crafting from recipes allows the player to build shelter, weapons, and tools like axes. Players can forage and farm plants as well as hunt animals for sustenance, with several characters having dietary perks or restrictions. Food can spoil, however, so the player cannot keep it for too long. Eating spoiled food results in a loss of health, sanity, and an increase in hunger. Each in-game day takes 8 minutes of real time.\n\nDeath can occur in a variety of ways. The player has three gauges displayed on the game's head-up display, which respectively track hunger, health, and sanity. Hunger worsens by default, being replenished with food. Sanity decreases during the dusk and night or as a result of specific unpleasant actions, such as robbing graves or fighting monsters; it can be replenished through mentally stimulating activities, such as sleeping, picking flowers, and wearing fashionable clothing. When hunger gets too low, it begins to chip away at health, which will eventually result in the player's death. A large variety of creatures can attack the player, including giant one-eyed birds, tree monsters, tentacles whose owners are not shown, and even small, weak frogs that will nonetheless try to accost the player and steal from them. Additionally, at low enough sanity, figments of the character's imagination become corporeal and able to attack the player. Some creatures, such as pig-like creatures often found in tribes, begin as neutral to the player (Excluding the Reign of Giants character Webber), but the player's actions may lead them to be allies or hostile foes.\nThe bulk of the game is played in Sandbox Mode, but there is a second mode, Adventure, which the player can access by finding a landmark called Maxwell's Door. Adventure serves as the game's campaign, consisting of five levels that pit the player against Maxwell, the antagonist of Don't Starve. The player loses all items and recipes upon entering, and can only pick four to keep upon completion of each chapter. Death or the end of the five sections returns the player intact to Sandbox Mode.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== Characters ===\nWilson, a gentleman scientist, is the protagonist of Don't Starve. While Wilson has no special abilities beyond growth of \"a magnificent beard\", which slows the speed of freezing in winter and accelerates overheating in summer, other playable characters do; a few examples follow. Willow, a firestarter, is immune to fire damage and will start spreadable fires on the ground when she has low sanity. A girl named Wendy receives visits from her deceased twin sister Abigail when summoned. The strongman, Wolfgang, has high health and significant offensive capabilities that grow better the more his hunger meter is full, but he starves faster and loses more sanity when near danger. WX-78 is an android that nonetheless needs to eat, sleep, and stay mentally stimulated, but does not become ill from spoiled food, can increase its maximum health, hunger, and sanity with gears (reset to the original maximum after dying and respawning; the corpse leaves behind a portion of the used ones), and takes damage from rain. WX-78 also attracts lightning, being made of conductible material, that makes it surrounded by a glow that gradually dies down as time passes, that refills health, and that lowers sanity.The game's antagonist is Maxwell. Maxwell is described as a puppet master who is dapper and frail in stature. He is part-demon and transforms incrementally as his anger at the player increases over the five chapters of Adventure. He is the final unlockable character, obtained after completion of the story rather than with experience points. The character version of Maxwell starts with a Dark Sword, Night Armor, Purple Gem, 4 Nightmare Fuel and the Codex Umbra, a book that when activated uses 2 nightmare fuel, depletes 15 health, lowers maximum sanity by 55, and spawns a shadow clone of himself that aids him in battle, mining and wood chopping. Shadow Puppets have 75 health and deal 40 damage with each attack. When they die, they disappear and return Maxwell's lost maximum of sanity. A maximum of 3 puppets can be spawned at once, and each will disappear 2.5 days after it is spawned if it doesn't die earlier.\n\n\n=== Story ===\nThe game opens with Maxwell snidely informing the player of their gaunt appearance and includes little further story. The game's setup is told further through its trailer: on a dark and stormy night, Wilson appears to be getting nowhere in a chemistry experiment until he is startled by his radio speaking to him. It reveals that it has noticed his trouble and has secret knowledge of him. When he eagerly agrees, a flurry of equations and diagrams encircle him and fill his head. Using white rats, a typewriter, and his blood among other tools and materials, Wilson creates a giant machine. The radio commends his work and tells him to pull the machine's switch. He hesitates, but at the radio's insistence, he does so. The machine rattles violently, and a pair of ghostly arms whisk him into a different world while an apparition of Maxwell cackles.During the Adventure mode, at the start of each chapter, Maxwell appears and comments. At first, he seems impressed at the player's hardiness; he then becomes irritated and urges the player to turn back. He offers the player a truce but, upon its decline, becomes enraged.At the end of Adventure mode, the player reaches an island called Maxwell's Island with a hall belonging to Maxwell on it. The player finds Maxwell trapped in a throne encircled by short stone pillars. The player is at first unable to free him but finds a keyhole and a key nearby. The player sets Maxwell free, but he turns into a skeleton and disintegrates as he stands up. The ghostly arms from the trailer then grab the player and ensnare him in the throne. An epilogue implies that the player will take on a villainous role similar to Maxwell's using newfound powers given by the throne but will nonetheless be trapped forever.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Conception and design ===\nDon't Starve was developed and published by indie studio Klei Entertainment. The game began development as part of a 48-hour game jam in 2010. The team liked the idea but shelved it until two years later, when they had the time to flesh it out. Full development commenced in 2012, while Klei was nearing the end of the development process of Mark of the Ninja. This was during the heat of an industry trend of creating games in which players are dropped into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival. The torch of this movement was held by the 2011 sandbox game Minecraft. Member Kevin Forbes stated in an interview that Minecraft was one of the team's biggest influences, particularly its exploration elements. However, as the game was conceived as a \"weird experiment\", the team's main goal was to innovate in terms of gameplay and aesthetics, specifically by adding a layer of emphasis on characterization and themes. Another influence was the 2005 Nintendo DS title Lost in Blue, which contains similar supernatural elements and a day/night cycle.The game's dark and supernatural yet cartoonish art style was influenced by the work of filmmaker Tim Burton, to which it has been frequently compared, and by writers Edward Gorey and H.P. Lovecraft. Forbes noted the team's ambition of creating something \"dark and creepy.\" After conception of the basic game setup, Forbes penned a backstory influenced by steampunk and horror, and lead creative director Jeff Agala added comic strip-like art elements. To further the game's atmosphere of loneliness and directionlessness, Klei decided firmly against multiplayer gameplay. However, in December 2014, after numerous requests, Klei finally released the multiplayer version of the game titled \"Don't Starve Together\" on Steam Early Access after an initial closed beta release. \nDevelopment was marked by a few changes to the game's formula that would be reverted. Most notably, at one point during development, Klei wanted to add quests to the existing open gameplay. Klei shelved this idea when they realized that \"having external goals is extremely counter to what is fun about the game.\" Nevertheless, Klei co-founder Jamie Cheng has emphasized that Klei values the freedom to try different approaches that being tied to a major publisher would not afford them.Cheng related in an interview that Don't Starve's development taught Klei a considerable amount about the nature of the emergent gameplay that was endemic to its open and random world; Klei tries to experiment with a new genre with each project and prefers not to create sequels to any of its games. These lessons would later be used to balance the mechanics of Klei's upcoming project Invisible, Inc.\n\n\n=== Releases and updates ===\nKlei employees argued at length about whether to release Don't Starve as a free-to-play game. Forbes stated that he \"wouldn't rule it out as a business model\" but that the team was not ready to make such a decision. It was, however, free in the early days of beta testing.Don't Starve was released in beta form in 2012, a move that Klei decided on to find out \"what aspects of the game players are really responding to, and [nip] usability issues in the bud.\" Klei's Cory Rollins has stated that he finds that most developers' beta periods simply serve as an early release of the game and result in few glitches being fixed, and wanted to make more use of the strategy. Added benefits the team discovered during beta testing were that it forced them to make important decisions about the game's upcoming release well in advance, and that it solidified a player base. In addition, Klei added the ability for food to spoil during this time, inspired by a forum thread about such possibilities. Cheng found Don't Starve to have \"ended up a way better game because of the community.\" It spent a few months in beta testing, and Klei continued to give updates for months after its release.In June 2013, shortly after the game's main release, a PlayStation 4 version was announced; it would not be released until January of the following year. In a January 2014 interview, Rollins mentioned internal discussions of creating a PlayStation Vita version of Don't Starve, citing massive community interest in playing it on the PlayStation 4 remotely. An iOS edition was released in July 2014. The company is also considering other mobile phone adaptations, as well as a potential sequel, but is not prioritizing them.\n\n\n==== Don't Starve: Reign of Giants ====\nDon't Starve: Reign of Giants, the game's first paid downloadable content expansion, was announced on January 18, 2014. Three cryptic teasers were released, each named after a season of the year. The first, \"Fall\", shows a badger-like creature, while \"Winter\" adds an unlockable arachnid character named Webber and \"Spring\" a furry leg accompanied by a hatching egg. The expansion was made available as early access on April 2 and was released on May 1. It contains new items, characters, and environments.\n\n\n==== Don't Starve Together ====\nOn May 7, 2014, Klei announced that a free multiplayer expansion, Don't Starve Together, would be coming later that year. As they had initially decided not to create multiplayer, Klei clarified on their forums that they originally had not been \"confident that it would actually work both in concept and implementation\" but had changed their minds in response to popular demand and bringing in new help.Don't Starve Together made its debut on Steam's Early Access program on December 15, 2014. It supports up to six players at a time, who can be either existing friends or strangers and can play in public or private games. The expansion contains most, if not all, features of the single-player game, but with ongoing balance patches being made for multiplayer. The game was released out of early access on April 21, 2016.\n\n\n==== Don't Starve: Giant Edition ====\nA PlayStation Vita port of Don't Starve titled Don't Starve: Giant Edition was announced on August 25, 2014 and was released on September 2, 2014 in North America, and September 3, 2014 in Europe. This was also announced to be released for the Wii U via the Nintendo eShop on March 4, 2015.  Wii U Specific Features: Enjoy Off-TV Mode! Use companion map via the Wii U GamePad to navigate around the world “Reign of Giants” DLC available at launch. Giant Edition was released in North America on May 28, 2015 and in Europe on June 4, 2015.  A PlayStation 3 port was developed by Abstraction Games and released in North America on June 23, 2015, as well as in Europe on June 24, 2015. An Xbox One version was released on August 26, 2015.\n\n\n==== Don't Starve: Shipwrecked ====\nDon't Starve: Shipwrecked, co-developed by Super Time Force studio Capybara Games, was released on PC on the first day of December 2015 in early access. This expansion includes new characters, biomes, creatures, and seasonal effects.\n\n\n==== Don't Starve: Pocket Edition ====\nDon't Starve: Pocket Edition was released on July 9, 2015, for iOS and includes the Reign of Giants DLC. The Android version was officially released on October 20, 2016.\n\n\n==== Don't Starve: Hamlet ====\nDon't Starve: Hamlet was announced on September 13, 2017. The single-player DLC is expected to be released in December, 2018.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDon't Starve received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. The game sold one million copies by the end of 2013. Don't Starve was a finalist for the grand prize and \"Excellence in Design\" subcategory at the 2014 Independent Games Festival awards ceremony. It also received honorable mentions for \"Excellence in Visual Art\" and \"Excellence in Audio.\"The game's art style was critically acclaimed. Summarizing that the \"distinct art style and atmosphere set a cool vibe,\" GameSpot's Nathan Meunier commended the atmosphere and visual design. Marty Sliva of IGN claimed an \"immense appreciation for the paper-cutout graphical style and whimsical presentation\", going on to praise the threatening qualities bestowed upon mundane objects by the \"gothic-inspired look.\" Game Informer writer Jeff Marchiafava stated that \"the cartoony art style makes exploring your massive, randomized world a joy.\" Writing for the newspaper Toronto Sun, Steve Tilley called the art \"whimsical and wonderful\" and the presentation in general \"captivating.\" Reviewing the PlayStation 4 version specifically, Jordan Devore of Destructoid said that it looked and played very well on the console, though he did note some pixelation effects when the screen zooms in on the inventory. He also found that the gamepad controls, while less efficient than a keyboard, were similarly enjoyable.The music was generally well received. Sliva compared it to carnival music and called it \"immediately catchy\" though lacking in variation. Giancarlo Saldana of GamesRadar called it \"eerie [yet] calming\" and praised its role in complementing the simultaneously lonesome and dangerous world.Critics universally acknowledged but gave mixed opinions on the game's high level of difficulty. This sentiment was captured by Sliva's comment that \"Don't Starve will never, ever hold your hand, and I both love it and hate it for that.\" For example, he felt some of his deaths were unfairly caused by the game's camera system obscuring needed objects. Meunier stated that \"survival doesn't come easy, but there's an undeniable thrill to the challenge,\" but also placed the high difficulty in his list of the game's cons. Leon Hurley of Official PlayStation Magazine claimed that \"learning is half the fun and even the smallest victory makes you feel like you’re winning with a capital FU.\" Reviewers also felt that players' levels of satisfaction would depend heavily on their levels of commitment to survival.The lack of a permanent saving mechanic and permanence of death were criticized. Marchiafava, while normally a fan of permadeath in games, found it problematic in Don't Starve because, unlike other games such as The Binding of Isaac and Spelunky, Don't Starve is much longer and so death felt like more of a loss. Meunier noted that the novelty and thrills of each new run wear off somewhat \"when you're stuck tackling the same menial tasks over and over again to regain lost ground.\" Sliva expressed disappointment at being given \"nearly no recognition from Don't Starve itself\" upon being killed by a frog, and reported being bored for roughly 30 minutes at the overly familiar starts of later playthroughs. Brown thought similarly, also calling the early game in particular \"a bit dull.\" Saldana, however, reasoned that \"you at least gain some knowledge of how things work\" and would make incremental, enjoyable progress.The variety of unusual, numerous, and frequently placed ways for the player to die were singled out for praise. Focusing on the harm caused by subzero temperatures during winter, Meunier found that \"these interesting wrinkles add depth and additional difficulty to the already challenging survival mechanics at play.\" Jessica Conditt of Joystiq praised the high number of ways to die and the game's efficient, easy-to-understand display of the player's health, hunger, and mental stability. Saldana noted that the unfamiliarity of some monster designs would help to keep the player wary.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCrashlands\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
      "Indie game news, reviews, previews & developer interviewsadvertisementWe held off reviewing Don’t Starve from Vancouver-based indie game developers Klei Entertainment for this long because we wanted to wait and see just what, exactly, it would become – the game’s development path is a decidedly modern one in this age of crowdfunding and early access paid betas, but a little different. We are glad we held out; with several months of release on Steam under its belt, we feel the game is substantive enough, and “settled into place” sufficiently to deserve a review in earnest, having now demonstrated what it will ultimately become.Let’s dial the time-wheel back a little to better understand what that means…It all began innocently enough: When we first saw Don’t Starve at PAX Prime 2012, it was in a small corner of Klei Entertainment’s booth near the indie wing of the huge convention center, where community manager Corey Rollins was passing out business cards beside a simple table with a 22″ HD display running a demo of the game. When I asked him about the Edward Gorey-styled paper-cutout images moving onscreen to a macabre 1920’s carnival soundtrack – likely of shock-haired Mr. Wilson running from spiders through a burning forest, he uttered, quite obviously by rote: “Don’t Starve is an uncompromising wilderness survival game full of science and magic.”Watch IGR’s original video interview about Don’t Starve with Corey Rollins at PAX Prime 2012:Rollins mentioned that it was already available for purchase on the Google Chrome store as a paid beta and that they would be rolling out regular updates in anticipation of their Steam launch sometime later in the year or as late as Q1 2013.I went back to my hotel and instantly purchased it for US$13.00 which also awarded me a second copy I could gift to a friend, which I immediately passed along to my PAX colleague. I started playing it that night, and couldn’t stop. The game was uncompromising indeed, but hours later, I realized that in spite of its early development state, there was something about the game that successfully balanced all the most addictive elements of a game – easy to pick up with fast-scaling complexity, logical but interesting tech trees, short and long range goals, discovery, mystery, causality and the non-linear challenge of seeing how long you could last before your own idiosyncratic impulses led to your untimely and irreversible demise in an open world.A tall, thin man in a pinstriped suit welcomes Wilson (or on of several other unlockable characters) in the midst of the wilderness, with naught but the clothes on his back. The first stages of his survival require him to gather food, and materials for a fire that can last through the night. To accomplish these tasks, the player can mouse over various items on the screen and click to interact with them. Some will result in picking up a resource that can be used or combined with other elements. Others (such as trees and large rocks) might require the acquiring of buildable axes, pickaxes or shovels as the case may be, before they can be manipulated.By climbing this gradual hierarchy of needs, Wilson can eventually create a Science Machine, allowing for the creation of more advanced implements. While the milestone is impressive, the new creations should be pursued with caution, as Wilson will still meticulously gravitate towards malnourishment without the occasional roasted rabbit or two.I learned this the hard way. After a series of moderately successful rounds of survival, I encountered my first gold nugget, and eagerly constructed my mechanical brain-booster. I toiled over new tools and niceties well into the night. It wasn’t until I noticed that my health was plummeting that it dawned on me: It had been nearly a full two days since the last time I trapped a rabbit. Scouring my inventory revealed that all of my edibles had gone into my brainy exploits. My quest ended, and I was returned to the title screen. Oh, right…Don’t Starve…In hindsight, The Science Machine was but the tip of the iceberg. The Alchemy Engine opens a second tier of goods that be can prototyped from more refined materials. Whip up a crock pot, an ice box, and a drying rack. Not only will you be able to keep meat from spoiling for longer, but by combining meats and veggies, you can whip up tasty treats that come packed with boosts to all three attributes.Should you choose to explore the entirety of the crafting tree (note: it gains branches with every content update), the capability is there for Wilson to create a wealth of helpful items that will assist him in farming, the preservation of food, and weaponry, but only if he doesn’t first keel over from hunger.This delicate balance is what generates the real challenge. You’ll need to scavenge and hunt to keep your belly from shriveling into a husk, but you need to make discoveries and create new items to keep your mind active. While a starvation death makes for a far more drastic end, losing your mental focus will result in the emergence of ethereal shadow beasties. They’ll only lurk near you at first, but for each Cocoa Puff you drop in the insanity bowl, they get more and more substantial.Eventually, you’ll be battling it out with invisible critters that can nevertheless sink their fangs into you. Also keep in mind that every time you start a new game, (which will be often when you first get going), the world is randomly-generated. There are extensive controls for tailoring in what way it may be generated, adding biases for certain elements etc.In some games I had a world of grassy pastures patrolled by manure-dropping beefalos, while others were chock-full of pig-men and spiders at war with one another.In some there were gold nuggets literally laying about as if they were raining down from the sky, while others I couldn’t mine a gold vein if my life depended on it, which made any scientific research impossible and starved me out intellectually, rather than physically.All of the beasts (real or shadowy) share a cartoon-like whimsy. Most of them look rather harmless, but getting too close or carelessly lashing out at any of them can result in a quick death, or a run that will take you far from camp. Some beasts will require you to develop some hefty upgrades before they can be feasibly confronted, but most of them are going to trounce you if you’re fool enough to challenge a pack.Not all critters automatically want to eat your face. Some can be bargained with, and might even toss a few haymakers about should a nefarious brood of pack animals decide you smell delicious. There’s nothing worse than getting gang-mauled and having your carefully constructed slice-o’-paradise go to waste, so make friends and don’t be afraid to sweeten the deal with a savory morsel here and there. You can even gain the knowledge of how to construct domiciles that will attract allies; think of it as a primitive barracks at the edge of town.GAMEPLAY TIPS: Specifically – while you can attack and carve up the pig-men for a late bacon snack, you may consider keeping your faction with them on the happy side, and build your HQ nearby – this way, when the nasty follering-dog-pack comes nipping at your heels, you can kite them through the pig village and have the oinks do all the dirty work.Alternatively, and perhaps the better solution, is to build your HQ in a savannah, near a dense cluster or rabbit holes, and then, once you are far enough up the tech tree, build a hammer and break down some pig houses to relocate nearby. This way you will have a steady supply of food to dry on meat drying racks (that produce jerky) to get you through the long winter. Don’t forget to lay as many traps as you can over those rabbit holes though!Gameplay Tip Caveat Emptor\nShould you choose to indeed build your nest near the pig folk, be sure to keep a watchful eye on the moon phase, as when it becomes full, your snorting buddies will turn into were-creatures for a good two minutes and are very dangerous and difficult to outrun. During this period, you may want to camp out in a remote location, and return after the moon begins to wane. Note that you may also trigger their dark side by feeding them too much monster meat (4 units actually). Besides this dangerous eventuality, however, they make good chums to keep about.In the event that you are having trouble making friends with any of the strange creatures in the strange land you are inhabiting, there are (sometimes) shrines that you can tap which will allow you to resurrect your character, albeit without all of the materials he or she has so painstakingly gathered. Alternatively you can build a meat effigy deeper along the tech tree. Perhaps the gods of Don’t Starve are merciful after all?And this sense of loss – rez spots or otherwise – is where the game will polarize players – some may find it simply far too exasperating to lose so much time with nothing to show for it but some daft memories, and maybe a character unlock. Others will find this is survival, time-management game a big slice of Heaven pie…Don’t Starve may not be for everyone – for those who hate grinding, this is anathema. Essentially, it can become a game predominantly about grinding. Then again, I remember when Everquest 2 decided to offer two paths – the adventurer path and the craftsman. At the time I thought – why would anyone want to forego hack-n-slashing Orcs to go mushroom picking instead?Well, I got schooled. Gathering and hunting is a noble and exciting path all its own, and this is what Don’t Starve relies on, because what combat there is, is decidedly unfair in the enemy’s favor, and provisional at best. By the way, this is not a criticism of the combat, it is a necessity in the world of the play as it heightens the nightmare belaboring your character – like trying to run from a killer, but not ever gaining any momentum. In fact, the false sense of security that spears, fire darts and twine armor afford, is an ingenious way of heightening the sense of fear, urgency, dread and suspense in the 2D world Klei has created.For those who find time and resource management and experimentation the height of entertainment, Klei has created a gift for you wrapped up in big pink bows. Striking a careful balance between your hunger, health and sanity is addressed in a manner far more creative and generous than simple gauges that rise and fall (there are now mods that allow you to repurpose the GUI for when you mean business) – they have gone a step further to artfully craft the symptoms of their effects into the very fabric of the experience.Once you have got your bearings, figured out the tech trees, and maybe even made it through winter, having crafted some bunny muffs, a puffy jacket and a barbecue, with your trusty heat stone safely stowed on your person, it may be time to finally leave the endlessly fascinating variation of the sandbox and find out just what in the darkest of hecks is actually going on.Because in fact, that tall man in the pin-striped suit you met way back at the beginning of this Count of Monte Cristo-like prison? His name is Maxwell, and he means you no good. In fact in a sort of JJ Abrams style twist of fate, you may in fact be a pawn in some far deeper endgame, and the only hope of respite for your soul, is to track him down and figure out what it is he wants from you after all.Suddenly the game opens up into a whole new scale, as you discover a strange mechanical device marked “Maxwell’s Door” and upon engaging it are warned that you are about to leave the little concept of a world you have thus far fashioned, behind – along with everything you have so meticulously gathered – and leap into a far more perilous odyssey.I can’t divulge much more here without spoiling things for you, dear reader, but the comprehensive Don’t Starve Wiki will be more than happy to do that for you, along with answering hundreds of questions you may have accumulated by this point.Needless to say, many may never even arrive at this campaign mode, but it is rather remarkable that an entirely separate kind of game exists beyond the initial scenario to which you are presented.Six months after my first taste, the company had released a series of updates and patches, all of which added substantial new gameplay elements – weather, mental health gauges, new beasties, additional crafting, rich modding tools, and even a new underworld (still a work-in-progress), all of which also recursively improved the way they had been done up until that point.Many suggestions came from the user forums, and many of those were considered or addressed in some way directly by the developers. This long paid beta, and wide-open transparent dialogue with the public was a very alluring and evidently successful collaborative method for improving the game in the direction that its demographic desired, but never cowing to their every whim – thus maintaining its integrity whilst demonstrating the framework to be adaptable.I stepped away from the game in this time, just to give it some breathing room in hopes that I could see it more clearly as the full game it was destined to become, and I was simply astonished by the amount that was added from the time I first got hooked all those months before. It had already been a fun, engaging, and highly replayable title, but now it had enough variety that even two good solid nights of play still had not revealed all that there was to discover. Indeed a year later, this remains true.I will say, that every so often, on my Quadcore laptop with integrated AMD graphics, the game can sometimes choke up a little, and I have to close all other running applications or restart the game. Other times, when I would try to plant something, Wilson seemed unsure of what I wanted and would stutter back and forth in place until I reclicked in a spot that pleased him. Perhaps this is intentional, but it looked glitchy, and not something that should be happening this late into release.I am not exactly sure I can blame it on the game, but it may be a little further optimization is required on the dev’s side. It most definitely is not a killer, but it is there and worth mentioning, as so much timing and precision is required to beat the three clocks you have constantly ticking down, and stand to lose so much, that smooth gameplay is a must with this title.For example, when you have only moments of daylight left and your fire needs to be built and you left it too late, you could technically build a campfire, but if clicking doesn’t happen in a split second, all goes dark and you are going to die at the hand of the boogeymen. At one point I was trying to click on my logs to add fuel to my campfire, but they would not pick up, and then there was no turning back, so yes, precision and timing matters and any lag on the game’s part can cause you to lose hours upon hours of work.Only for this reason, and the fact that it may not appeal to everyone for its “uncompromising,” unforgivingly grindish mechanic does it not get the perfect score it otherwise more than deserves.In fact Don’t Starve is easily one of the most engaging and entertaining games of 2013 or any year, in any category – the artwork, with its Georges Méliès styled undulating ocean waves, the beautifully sinister Klezmer soundtrack and woodwind-voiced avatars, the time management game design are all creatively first-rate and compose a deliciously villainous universe to romp around and tinker with. The animations all feature lovely subtle variation, and every object in the world feels alive, even expressive – from the way the trees pop up or shrivel, to the vast array of critters fluttering, skittering, crawling and stalking about, all with unique proximity responses to your player character.The updates keep coming – new characters have been added, along with new craftables, whole new zone types (the bunny caves which can be accessed by mining randomly placed sinkholes), all manner of creatures and “power-ups”. What Klei has done is defined, in the best way, a new legitimate way of procedural game development; rather than charge a smaller sum for these expansions under the guise of downloadable content (aka the ubiquitous “DLC”), they simply keep expanding the original idea with a healthy dose of feedback, suggestions and requests from the growing fan base. It is a case study in how to do this right.A little over a year since I first started playing Don’t Starve, I feel like I have barely scratched its necessarily multi-terrain surface – the same surface that now covers an even more mysterious subterranean adventure and answers to questions, so very many questions…I’m coming for you Maxwell. We are late, for a very important date.With additional contributions by CallabrantusRating:advertisementView previous campaigns.Powered by MailChimpadvertisementLast Post:Next Post:This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

      "Try to survive in a world of magic and science with minimal resourcesDon’t Starve is a very unique game that puts the player in the role of a scientist trying to survive in a completely hostile wilderness. The game mixes many elements from different genres to create a unique experience. The distinctive graphics are something players will notice immediately. Although the game is truly 3D, most objects look like a flat paper cutout. The art very effectively catches the dark and uncertain mood of the game.Players start in Don’t Starve with the sole goal of not starving to death. Players are free to walk anywhere in the game in order to find food. The game is divided into day and night. There are far more threats at night than during the day. Players will spend most of the time during the day looking for food and gathering resources from the map like wood. When night comes, players need to maintain a fire and eat.There are many different types of monsters in Don’t Starve. Several have unique behaviors making avoiding or battling the monsters challenging. Instead of simply finding equipment and weapons, the game has a crafting system. Players learn to create progressively more powerful or useful items over time from the resources in the game. Resources can be mined from the ground, retrieved from trees or claimed from defeated monsters. Killing spiders provides silk that can be used to make a garment.Don’t Starve also has a few unusual elements most players are not used to. Death is permanent. There are no ways to save games or resurrect characters. Additionally, nearly everything can kill the character. This includes standing in the cold, not eating and lighting a tree on fire. If the character dies, players must restart from the beginning without any of the perks, skills or items previously learned. The world is randomly generated every time a new game starts although the first part of play is largely the same regardless of the map. Don’t Starve is a fun and interesting game that can provide hours of very challenging play.Sandbox physics mod for Half-Life 2 that became so popular that it was made into a standalone releaseThe action-packed fifth main installment in a world-renowned series, complete with single player and multiplayer modesTaking its inspiration from some of the legendary games like DayZ, Rust is a tough game on all accountsBuild your own cities and test your skills in combat against some of the toughest opponentsno thanks",

      "Don't Starve is a Roguelike dark fantasy survival game created by Klei Entertainment and released in April, 2013. It is currently available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux through Steam or stand-alone application. Don't Starve is also available on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox One, PlayStation Vita,[1] and Wii U.[2]Don't Starve challenges the player to survive in a wilderness environment for as long as possible. In Sandbox Mode, the only way the game ends is with the player's death or by restarting the game in a new random world through the use of the Wooden Thing. When the player dies they are awarded Experience for the number of days they survived. Each death provides experience, which is added to a cumulative total and used to unlock additional playable characters. Although death is permanent and the player's world will be lost when the game ends, various methods of resurrection can be found to stave-off the inevitable.The canonical game plot centers around Wilson, a gentleman scientist tricked by the mysterious Maxwell into building a machine which transports him to a strange world filled with monsters and other challenges.[3] The player must help Wilson navigate the various worlds of Adventure Mode, which offer more difficulty as the game progresses. Wilson will begin to understand why Maxwell brought him into this world and the terrible secret of his power. Along the way, the player will find an extra character who can only be unlocked during Adventure Mode, and he will eventually confront Maxwell himself.Main article: Don't_Starve/Version_HistoryThe game's developer, Klei Entertainment, has committed to a series of game updates for at least 6 months after the game's initial release. A large portion of these updates have focused on adding a new environment (Caves) to the game, along with other new content and bug fixes.[4]Main article: DLCDon't Starve: Reign of Giants was the first downloadable content pack created for Don't Starve.Don't Starve: Shipwrecked is the second downloadable content pack created for Don't Starve.Don't Starve Together is the multiplayer expansion of Don't Starve, distributed independently from Don't Starve game in Steam.Don't Starve: Giants Edition is the PlayStation Vita port of Don't Starve, containing the Reign of Giants DLC.Don't Starve Pocket Edition is the iOS 8+/Android 5.1+ game, containing the Reign of Giants DLC.Don't Starve Pocket Edition: Shipwrecked is sold as a separate app for iOS 8+, and it only includes the Shipwrecked DLC.Don't Starve: Nintendo Switch Edition is the special version of Don't Starve for Nintendo Switch, containing both the Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked DLCs.Don't Starve has received moderately positive reviews from critics. GameRankings has given it a combined score of 78.69%, while Metacritic gives it 79/100. Armchair Empire rated the game 8.5/10 saying, \"Players looking for a game that will consume them for the next while should consider Don't Starve. The whole process of gathering supplies, and making a go of surviving in the wild while fending off starvation, madness, and predators is quite entertaining.\"[5] Hardcore Gamer Magazine however was more negative, giving the game only a 2.5/5 rating and saying, \"Unless there’s a major update in the near future, you’d be better off waiting until it inevitably becomes part of an indie bundle so that you can briefly jump in and enjoy its first few hours. Until then, your money and time should be spent elsewhere.\"[6]Don't Starve was a finalist for the grand prize and \"Excellence in Design\" subcategory at the 2014 Independent Games Festival awards ceremony; it also received honorable mentions for \"Excellence in Visual Art\" and \"Excellence in Audio.\" [7]",

It'll probably be a lot more manageable than the Forge.watchasi'mprovenwrongvery,veryquicklyhype meter is all the way up, i will freaking scream if we get a beta nowNice, at last something confirmed!I hope that this time we'll get worlds that are at least somewhat randomized, that would be really fun.I like how that swamp-like gate spits out not only our survivors, but a flag and a hammer as well  I just wonder, how is it happening that the characters arrive fully dressed to the scene? It seems that that gate is indeed very magical.Wonder what's up with this entity and trying to hide the scales.Main goat has scales on a lot of the body, and there are friendly merms.Perhaps not feeding the gnaw is making them into merms..?LORE!!Wonder what's up with this entity and trying to hide the scales.*Craving for Loyal rarity items intensifies*Beta starts early next week, so keep an eye on the forums.

I highly recommend you guys check out the Roger Corman/Vincent Price film \"Haunted Palace\". They're borrowing elements of \"The curious case of Charles Dexter Ward\".I recall reading \"mermification\" in some of the leaked strings.Meaning merms aren't natural, and are a result of Gnaw's plague perhaps?i'll need to find some friends!at this point i dont doubt the next event is gonna be called \"the horge\"Now that it's confirmed that the Gnaw is in the sky, I'm doubly curious as to the icon.The green scales are probably for the merm \"curse\" or whatever, but the shape itself seems to belong to more of a tentacle then anything else.i noticed that charlie doesnt appear on this trailer, but she does on the forge and new reign onesPowered by Invision Community",
      "The Gorge is an Event exclusive to Don't Starve Together, and the second of a planned series of such events. It follows the events of The Forge, the first event. The Gorge is a 3-person challenge involving cooking, farming, and gathering ingredients.A beta of the event started on June 12th, 2018, and ran until the official event went live on June 14th, 2018. On July 6th, 2018, The Gorge Tournament was announced which offered prizes including exclusive Portrait Frames and Profile Icons.[1] After the event ended on July 17th, 2018, Klei Entertainment published several official statistics. The Gorge event may return in the future.See also: The Gorge RecipesAfter barely escaping through the Molten Gateway, our survivors plummet headfirst into the ruins of a sickly city ruled by a ravenous beast. Work together to cook fine dishes and placate the Eternal Gnaw's hunger to avoid the curse of its terrible plague. Cook well enough, and you may even get to go home.Game Mode Description:\nCook delicious dishes to appease the Eternal Gnaw in this Gate Realm.\n* Enter the world through the Mossy Gateway.\n* No nighttime.\n* Use what you can find to cook offerings for the altar!Players can join other players either via Quick Match, which drops them into the best server the matchmaker finds, or by manually browsing available servers. Alternatively, a player can request a custom server via Custom Match, allowing them to set the server's name, description, password and whether or not it is associated with a Steam Group. All Gorge matches take place on specially dedicated servers, and as such, players cannot host their own servers.It is not necessary to have a full set of three players to start a match, though it is recommended to do so. A round will begin either when all three player slots are filled up, or when all players in an incomplete party vote to begin without the full three.Characters have no Health, Hunger or Sanity, and only five inventory slots (four normal ones and a Hand slot). Characters spawn at the Mossy Gateway. The game is governed by the Gnaw's Hangry Meter, which depletes over time. The players have to snackrifice dishes on the Altar of Gnaw, which grant the players rewards in coins. Coins can be used to buy more cookware kits and other supplies. More valuable coins can get the players better supplies and more points. The following are the types of coins and their point value:These points are used to calculate the total Appeasement Points at the end of the match. Appeasement Points are calculated by adding all the snackrifice points, multiplying that by 1000, then dividing the product by the total number of seconds.[2]The amount and types of coins earned from a snackrifice varies depending on the following factors:The first craving is always a Snack. After the first dish is snackrificed, the Gnaw will have a different craving to be fulfilled, as told by Mumsy. This goes on until the player party earns at least three Gnaw's Favors, which can be used to obtain the Ancient Key from Mumsy. To win the game, the player party must put the Ancient Key in the Altar of Gnaw before the meter fully runs out.This lists the special abilities of all The Gorge characters.The Gorge Tournament began on July 10, 2018, and ran until July 17, 2018. To enter, players had to play a regular match and earn the following four badges:Earning other badges would not effect the entry. Getting these four badges granted the player a  Tournament Entry badge. Their score would be added to the leaderboard, which was viewable on the Gorge Recipe Book page under the Tournament section.

      "134.2m sharesOne of the most popular survival games of recent times comes to Switch, together with five years’ worth of DLC expansions…There are lot of things you do in video games that really wouldn’t be that much fun in real life. Driving a supercar or playing at Wembley might be the stuff of dreams but being caught up in World War III or chased by zombies is not the sort of thing you’d normally wish for. Being marooned in a hostile forest and forced to scratch a living from the earth doesn’t sound too fun either, and the problem with Don’t Starve is that sometimes first impressions are correct…Don’t Starve was first released as far as back as 2013 and has been subject to a steady stream of expansions, updates, and ports ever since. It’s by Klei Entertainment, who were responsible for the excellent Mark Of The Ninja and Invisible, Inc. But while Don’t Starve has proven to be more successful than either of those we’ve never liked it nearly as much. But then we haven’t played it for years, or seen any of its expansions, so this new Switch edition is a useful opportunity to give it another chance.The game’s title is as descriptive as they come but the particulars involve you playing the role of foppish scientist Wilson – and a variety of other unlockable characters – who have been trapped in a demonically-controlled wilderness. The visuals and music owe an obvious debt to Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, making everything look like it’s come from the pages of a gothic pop-up book.What exactly is going on and how you’re supposed to escape is left purposefully vague, not least because getting good enough to worry about such things will take most players an awful long time. Don’t Starve is a punishingly difficult game from the start, and although that’s mollified somewhat by the expansions we still don’t really understand why.You start out in a randomised map with no pre-set goal and little real direction as to what to do. In that sense there are clear elements of Minecraft, as well as more general roguelikes and Konami’s Stranded Kids/Lost In Blue series. As in all these games just staying alive is reward enough at first, as you try to gather enough wood and food to set up a basic campfire and to then think about creating a more permanent residence.There are obvious problems with this right from the start though, since a) the maps are randomised so it may take ages to find everything one go and just minutes the next and b) there are horrible big monsters chasing you around the whole time. Perhaps the most dispiriting factor though is that, as with roguelikes, when you die you lose your entire inventory up to that point.This also means that, even with the randomised levels, the first half hour or so of each go is pretty much the same, since your requirements for basic habitation and survival don’t vary. The game has a very complex crafting system, that lets you build everything from sheds to casserole pots, but the essentials are the same every time.That sort of old school all-or-nothing approach will please some gamers, but it will frustrate many more and we can’t help feeling it’s still misjudged. Bodily harm is not the only danger the game offers though and you must also keep up your sanity, by engaging in more stimulating tasks than just looking for interesting rocks. There are various science experiments you can set-up and these can be used to not only keep yourself sane but in some cases advance the story.Don’t Starve is a frustrating experience in more ways than one, as all the elements for a great game are here – it’s just that you have to pick around the more annoying aspects in order to enjoy yourself. How happy you are to do that depends on your own attitude to survival games, and clearly the game’s success shows that there are plenty of people happy to put up with the inconveniences. But just as many will feel it’s all too much like hard work.The Switch additions includes the two existing single-player expansions Reign Of Giants and Shipwrecked, but curiously not the co-op Don’t Starve Together. These do add a great deal of variety to the game though, with Shipwrecked in particular expanding the scope considerably with its sea-fearing theme. Although its load times are frustratingly long when you’re trying to play the game in handheld mode.With the expansions adding a more structured story element to the game this is definitely more enjoyable than the first time we played the game, but it’s still an experience that constantly seems to be tripping over itself. We want to love Don’t Starve but, even after all the changes and additions, we’re not sure the game feels the same way about us.Formats: Nintendo SwitchPrice: £17.99Publisher: Klei EntertainmentDeveloper: Klei EntertainmentRelease Date: 12th April 2018Age Rating: 12Email gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on TwitterIn Short: Half a decade’s worth of expansions deliver a dizzying array of features but this stylish survival game still frustrates as much as it entertains.Pros: The premise is interesting and the game looks great. Deep crafting system and an impressively interactive environment. The expansions greatly expand the variety and scope of the story.Cons: Permadeath just doesn’t seem very fair in context, and only underlines how repetitive the game can be in the early stages. Quite expensive, especially without the co-op expansion.Score: 7/10",

      "Rogue Legacy is a 2013 platform game with roguelike elements developed by Cellar Door Games. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, Linux, OS X, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Xbox One.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe goal of Rogue Legacy is to explore a randomly generated dungeon, defeat four bosses in each of the four unique environments of the dungeon, and then defeat the final boss. Characters have the default ability to jump and slash with their sword, along with secondary abilities, such as magic attacks, which use mana.Whenever a character dies as a result of losing all of their Hit Points (HP), control will transfer over to one of three randomly generated heirs which the player may choose between, though this number may be increased to six with a later upgrade. Each descendant carries their unique characteristics and abilities, including such genetic peculiarities as color-blindness (in which the game is presented in black and white), ADHD (in which the player moves faster) and dwarfism (in which the character is short and can fit into small gaps).\nGold found while exploring the castle can be used to improve the character's equipment and abilities, which are passed on to that character's heirs. Gold can be found by smashing pieces of furniture, opening chests, or defeating enemies. There are also various fairy chests hidden in special rooms throughout the castle, most of which require the player to complete an objective, such as taking no damage in the room, in order to be opened.\nSpending gold on the manor, which appears after a new heir is chosen, can increase stats, such as health and mana, and unlock and upgrade new classes that may be carried by one of the heirs. These include mages, which can use more advanced spells, warriors, who have higher strength, and assassins, who can use various stealth techniques and have an increased likelihood of having a critical hit.\nGold can unlock the blacksmith, the enchantress and the architect, who each provide their own services. The blacksmith can use blueprints found in the castle to create new armor and equipment for the player, improving their stats. Similarly, the enchantress can use runes found in fairy chests to give the player enhancements, unlocking additional abilities such as double jumping and dashing. Finally, the architect can lock down the design of a previously encountered castle (so that a new one isn't randomly generated) in exchange for a percentage of any gold found.\nAny unspent gold must be paid to Charon in order to enter the castle, though upgrades can reduce the amount required to pay.\n\n\n=== Additional content ===\nThe game features a progressing \"New Game +\" feature, in which every completion of the game along a specific line of descendants increases the difficulty while also increasing the rewards offered by enemies and chests. After the second completion, the format for the name is \"New Game +n\" where n is the number of playthroughs since the first (Begins at +2, then +3, etc.). Notably, while enemies increase in difficulty theoretically forever, bosses do not get any harder across playthroughs. Furthermore, the player cannot normally increase in power beyond a certain point, though small increases to various stats beyond this soft-cap are possible through the \"Fairy Chests\" system.\nA number of secret bosses exist, all of which are remixed versions of each of the ordinary bosses. Upon defeating all of the secret ordinary bosses, one may challenge the secret version of the final boss in order to unlock the secret \"Traitor\" class, based on the first form of the final boss.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was developed by Cellar Door Games, a Toronto-based developer consisting of brothers Kenny and Teddy Lee. This was the brothers' biggest project to date and took 18 months to develop. The game was inspired by such titles as Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. Teddy compares the design to games like Spelunky and The Binding of Isaac, noting that their goal was to make the game relatively forgiving and accessible, while also allowing permanent progression. Due to the need to streamline the game, several prominent features were cut during development, including an experience system. Kenny added that the revenue from the game will allow them to focus on larger future projects.The game cost the team about $15,000 of their own money to develop, all of which was earned back within an hour of release. Rogue Legacy went on to sell more than 100,000 copies within the first week.Most versions of the game were done in-house. However, the Xbox One version was ported by Abstraction Games.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn December 2014, Cellar Door Games teamed up with IndieBox, a monthly subscription box service, to produce an exclusive physical release of Rogue Legacy. This limited, individually-numbered collector’s edition included a flash-drive with a DRM-free game file, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual and Steam key, as well as several custom-designed collectible items.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\nMetacritic gives the game a \"generally favorable\" score of 85/100 based on 43 reviews. GameRankings gives the game a score of 84 based on 26 reviews.Mitchell Saltzman of GameFront describes the game as \"insanely hard for the unprepared\". Philip Kollar of Polygon and Mike Splechta of GameZone mentioned the short life spans of their characters, and Scott Nichols of Digital Spy expressed frustration when first starting out. Other reviewers remarked that the game actually encourages these short runs while rewarding the player via the broader progression system. Ryan Stevens of GameTrailers described the game as \"[riding] the line of frustration and fun\". Saltzman concludes that \"difficulty may be a turnoff to those who get frustrated easily\".Lady Faye IV will be a playable character in the game Hex Heroes for the Wii U.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nDeveloper Cellar Door Games website",
      "PREAMBLEThese aren’t your standard design notes. Not only are they barely legible, but these are much, much lamer. This is also NOT how standard games are made. We’re two brothers who worked with one another at home, and we used Skype to communicate with the artist and musicians. Once you expand to a larger development team, things might fall apart. We also wing a lot of things… A LOT.Rogue Legacy required about 2 month of time to develop a basic engine and level editor to support the game we wanted to make. It was during this time when the majority of the core for Rogue Legacy was designed. So for this game, the concept was literally being made in conjunction with the tools that would be required to build it. Sort of a chicken or the egg scenario.***A lot of these notes were for the preliminary design. Additional notes were made as development of Rogue Legacy progressed, but they were more specific to individual issues that arose during production. Also these notes aren’t in chronological order. We don’t know what the correct order is.Teddy Lee\nCreative DesignerThis note talks more about our old skill tree design.Rogue Legacy’s skill tree design was originally planned to be closer to Kingdom Rush, and we called the skills “Totems”. As you placed skills in the lower parts of the totems, the higher up skills unlocked, thus the name.This system seems weird now, but back then the format for the game’s main progression wasn’t designed. We wanted to make defeating bosses extremely rewarding, so they originally unlocked additional totems for the player to “skill up”.Below that is a list of bonuses these “totem skills” would reward the player with. It’s not an exhaustive list because details like that in the early design phase aren’t necessary. Instead, what’s important is to show exactly how FAR REACHING an effect you wanted the skill tree to have on the game.  Macro focus over micro.The original design for the growing skill tree.  It was literally a tree.You can see from the notes that we were aiming for mostly passive skills. But even though they were passive, each listed skill had its own unique set of implementation rules that (in my mind) were important enough to look out for because they may have been tricky to code (I’m not a programmer).IE.Points 2,3,4 I don’t remember what the heck these are. Looks stupid.Manor vs. TotemWe also have the creation of the character classes here. So you can see that the original concept had knights which could block damage, and the Hokages which could Phase Shift. We had another class who could do charge attacks, but that was killed off early on. The dash move, on the other hand, got re-fitted into the Rune system that was later designed.You can also see the original control layout for the game. The B button used to be the Class-specific ability, and Y was potion (we originally wanted the player to be able to use consumable potions).A lot of the stuff here got cleaned up in the final version of the game and simplified.  As explained above, Dash became a Rune, the Y button became the Class-specific ability, and the skills were turned into single-press actions instead of direction-and-press (for some).  And potions became instant consumables.All of these original design concepts never actually got into production. We always re-examine our game while in development and often cut ideas before we waste time prototyping them. That’s a another reason why we don’t really care for design documents. They cut down on our ability to stay agile.A lot of people say it’s important to prototype (which it is), but it’s also important to have directed prototyping. If you’re working on something that has a 10% chance of getting in the game, then it’s a waste of time. So making cuts like these are massive time and money savers.The concept of Fairy Chests were written here. Along with it came the concept of the rune system.\nThe rune system was to allow people to bind the same type of rune onto a person, and let it scale infinitely.The original idea for runes was a bit more ambitious in terms of what they could do.  For example, one rune would give spike immunity, and adding additional runes would give alternate forms of immunity. Of course that cannot scale infinitely, so we thought about binding runes to a max of 5.  That still kept the immunity idea really complicated, not only to code, but to display to the user.  So we cut all of the rune ideas which could not naturally scale to infinity, in order to make a cleaner system.The spike immunity eventually went on to become a special item (Hermes boots).Hermes boots is legacy from when the game’s story had a much stronger Roman theme to it. As we iterated on the plot, we decided to reduce the amount of specific cultural references to allow us to have a bit more creative freedom.The EndThat’s it. Hope you enjoyed reading all this boring stuff!This was the design note written out for how the procedural map generator would work.It’s very light on text, just keywords to refresh my memory. From my experience, having long-winded explanations don’t really help.  This is true for a number of reasons:When things are written on paper, it also adds this imaginary weight to the idea.  Like, just because it’s been recorded it is now official and more important and valuable than the conversations spoken.  I know that sounds silly, but it’s true. Or at least I think it’s true. True enough for me.Also, things will never go according to what’s written.  It’s impossible to predict how difficult an idea is to implement, or how costly, or how time-consuming.  And if you have a design doc, it just adds an extra step to the game development process.When you’re designing something, especially something that’s complex, it’s best to keep it detail-light. That way when the input from the other team members are heard, changes can be made on the fly. Also, people will always strive to be lazy, not dumb. They’ll try to remember an idea that was mentioned, and if they forget, they’ll ask. Nobody wants to scrounge through a 60-page, massively detailed design doc to find that one sentence which possibly answer their question.**** Once again I’d like to reiterate that this is how we make games. And it probably won’t work for any teams larger than like… 5.This page is just a clean-up page. While doing the macro design for a game, you’ll visualize in your head a bunch of different aspects, and your notes will be all over the place. This page acted as sort of a mental clean-up, like a “Cliff Notes” that summarized my ideas to make sure nothing was missing.Doing a summary of your ideas is also a great way to tighten things up, because when you force yourself to really think through the game in a step-by-step process, you’ll start to see redundancies. Doing an overview of the whole thing allows you to combine or remove components from the game that may not need to be separate ideas, or have become obsolete.Below that note, there is a very light diorama explaining combat, and below that was the beginning of the Architect!We knew we wanted a way to “lock down” parts of the game but still provide a new experience with each playthrough.  The first concept was to lock down specific castle zones after defeating a boss. It was tossed out early due to the fact that:At the top of this attached note page you can see additional examples of the talents (i.e old traits).Below the note on talents was our “New Loss System”.  As mentioned earlier, Rogue Legacy originally had XP and gold. Gold was used to upgrade the totems (which became the manor). This gold stayed with you with each life.  The XP was reset, and unless you leveled, all your XP would go back to 0 on death.Every time you leveled up your base stats raised, and there would be an algorithm to make sure the player could go up an infinite amount of levels. This system was overly complicated, and the things we wanted XP to do in our game from a flow perspective weren’t working.It was a hard decision, but we decided the best route was to remove one of the forms of “currency” entirely. So we chucked XP, turned gold into the sole way to upgrade, and had gold take on the transient nature of XP along with it.This change paved way to one of our most iconic ideas.  The old XP system provided that rogue-like idea of consequence, because every time you died you lost all your XP.  We could not do that for gold because it was tied to your upgrades, so we had to come up with something else.  And that ultimately led to the creation of Charon.  Rather than remove your gold on death, we forced you to spend it before re-entering the castle.As a final note, I hated the fact that we cut the XP system. Not because I liked it, but because we added it, and I should of had the foresight to see that it wouldn’t mesh well. I didn’t think it through long enough, and that led to a bunch of wasted development time that could have been avoided.XP was another system (like talents) that got cut out entirely. No work that went into the XP system was ever retrofitted into other portions of the game. Consequences like that are solely the blame of the designer, so to all you aspiring game creators, make sure you take every idea you pitch very seriously.This is a short one.Just notes on general balance problems. I knew starting out we wanted a game which encouraged:Skill >>>>> Grind.But we still wanted people who weren’t very good at the game to complete it, so grinding had to be a feasible option.  This paper just has general concepts on how to set scaling of player damage, health etc. to make it not feel critical in the short run, but have it play a big impact in the long.® All Rights Reserved Cellar Door Games 2018® All Rights Reserved Cellar Door Games 2018",
      "I had first heard of Rogue Legacy through a recommendation from a follower on Twitter, who told me it was the type of game I might like. Apparently, my Twitter followers know me really, really well. Rogue Legacy is a game that is brimming with fresh ideas that invigorate the 2D action adventure genre and provide gamers with one of the most rewarding gaming experiences of 2013.Rogue Legacy Platforms: PC Developer: Cellar Door Games Publisher: Cellar Door Games Released: June 27, 2013 MSRP: $14.99Rogue Legacy, developed by Cellar Door Games, is billed as a “Rogue-lite,” a play on the roguelike genre that typically consists of games that have randomly generated levels, permadeath, and brutal difficulty.While Rogue Legacy does have randomly generated level layouts and can definitely be considered brutally difficult, the main aspect that sets it apart from other games in this genre is its unique approach to death, which I’ll get to in a little bit. First, let’s just talk about the overall structure of Rogue Legacy.When you begin the game, you enter a large castle made up of randomly generated rooms and enemies. Picture Castlevania mixed with Spelunky and you’ll get a good idea of what Rogue Legacy is all about. Like Castlevania, you move from room to room, clearing enemies and collecting loot as you explore deeper, though there are no areas locked off that require abilities you obtain later on. Every room of the castle can be explored from the start. Whether you’ll want to explore rooms way outside of your level range, though, is another issue. Hint: You won’t.The castle itself is divided into four areas. The base level is the starting point: to the north is the tower, to the east is the forest, and to the south is the dungeon. As mentioned before, you can head to any of the areas right from the start of the game, but there is definitely a recommended order in which to tackle them.Each of the four areas of the castle is guarded by a boss, and only by defeating all four bosses will the door to the final boss open. On paper, this seems like pretty standard procedure for a 2D sidescrolling action/adventure game, right? Well, crumple up that paper, because here is where things get interesting.When you die in Rogue Legacy — and you will die — all of your progress in that particular castle is lost. You’ll be brought back to the title screen and asked to begin your journey again. Only this time, you’ll be able to choose between three heirs to your legacy. Each of the three characters will have their own randomly generated classes, traits and special ability. It’s up to you to take all of that into consideration and select an heir that is best suited to whatever it is you’re trying to accomplish in your next run.The starting classes include a knight, a sorcerer, a barbarian and a knave. Knights are a good all-around class with decent stats across the board, sorcerers are glass cannons that focus on magical spells, knaves have weak stats but great critical hits, and barbarians have low strength/magic but a ton of health. There are more specialized classes that can be unlocked later, and while some are more useful than others, each has its own specific role that they fill.Traits are a little more interesting. These range from the useful, like “ADHD,” which allows you to run faster; to the detrimental, like “Ambilevous,” which causes you to throw your spells backwards; to the straight up strange, like “Vertigo,” which forces you to play the entire game upside down. There are a ton of these traits and you’ll want to try them all, even if they do end up leading you to your death at times.Fortunately, not everything is lost upon death. Your gold carries over to your next of kin, and you can use it to purchase permanent stat upgrades, open up NPC shops, buy new classes, upgrade existing classes, enhance your abilities, and much more. Each time you buy a new upgrade, more upgrades become available, leading to some tough decisions of whether you want to buff your character now, or purchase upgrades that might not be as helpful, but will unlock newer and better upgrades for the future.Once the shops are unlocked, you can also purchase new equipment, abilities, or passive buffs after first finding the corresponding blueprints or runes. The decisions that you make while shopping are critical because once you decide to head back into the castle, you must forfeit the remainder of your gold. You won’t be able to simply stockpile gold and wait until you’re able to afford the big upgrades.And you’re going to need these upgrades because Rogue Legacy can be insanely hard for the unprepared. Entering a wide-open room full of enemies feels like opening the doors to a bullet hell shooter as you’re blinded by a storm of colored dots to avoid. Fortunately, the game’s controls are simple, precise, and more than up to the task of enabling some pretty narrow escapes, especially once you have your full range of movement abilities. Just make sure to play it with a controller.One ingenious addition that will surely prevent unnecessary frustration is the architect. The architect is an NPC that you can purchase once you’re a good portion into the game, and for the price of 70 percent of the gold that you collect during your next run, he can keep the same castle layout as the previous run. So for example, let’s say after much hardship, I finally made it to the boss of the forest. But because of my low health, I don’t stand much of a chance and die. In my next run, if I use the architect, I can lock the previous castle layout in place, use a teleporter to get right back to the boss, and try again with a character at full life. The trade-off here is that the boss will drop substantially less gold, so it becomes a question of whether to take the risk and try to get to the boss on your own, or give up a chunk of your reward and get a free extra shot against the boss with a healthy character.This feature pretty much single-handedly saves Rogue Legacy from ever becoming too frustrating, and I can’t stress enough its importance for those who are having trouble with one of the game’s extremely tough boss battles.Rogue Legacy is a game that is full of interesting ideas, and the rare thing is, they all work. Sure, the random nature of the game can lead to some frustration when your three potential characters each have a crappy trait, but part of what makes Rogue Legacy fun is trying to make the best out of a poor situation. There’s a certain unique satisfaction you get when you perform better than you thought you would with a character you had low expectations for, based on his or her class and traits.It’s not for everyone, and I’d hesitate to recommend Rogue Legacy to those who get discouraged and frustrated easily. But for those who are looking for a challenge, Rogue Legacy is a must-play and a steal at its $15 price tag.Pros:Cons:Final Score: 90/100Game Front employs a 100-point scale when reviewing games to be as accurate about the experience as possible.

      "JiG is on Patreon and Needs You! Click here for more informationOn the surface, Cellar Door Games' indie action roguelike game Rogue Legacy is simple. You control a hero trying to navigate a deadly, ever-changing castle with the [arrow] keys, jumping with [S] and slashing with [D], and try not to die. But the twist isn't that you will die, although that's definitely a certainty. The twist is that when you do, you'll be able to keep playing as the child of that hero in an effort to best the castle for good... and those children might be born with a variety of real life conditions. Color blindness, dwarfism, even irritable bowel syndrome are just the tip of the iceberg. Some do nothing other than change the way you view the world, while others may have a big impact on how you play. But who decides what's a disadvantage anyway, and who says anyone can't be a hero?The majority of your time will be spent adventuring through the castle, trying to uncover its secrets and get past its many bosses. Once you die, that's that, and you'll be given the opportunity to pick from one of three potential heirs to resume playing... though the castle's interior will be completely different. Initially, you can expect to die. A lot. But as you gather coins, you can begin expanding your manor in a variety of ways to help you. You can pay for upgrades to strength and class abilities, or even entirely new classes, and new characters like the blacksmith or architect, whose abilities can make you even stronger.Naturally, paying for all this beneficial interior decorating is expensive. As a result, you can expect to do a lot of grinding, which here means dying a whole bunch since you can only spend gold after you're dead (who says you can't take it with you?) and any gold your new heir tries to carry back into the castle will be confiscated by its ghostly gatekeeper.Analysis: With its demand for reflexes and sadistic room design, Rogue Legacy isn't the game for people who like their roguelikes slow and turnbased. You're going to die a lot, and that sort of forced failure before glory won't sit well with everyone. Luckily, the castle's ever-changing interior means you'll rarely feel like you're trudging back through the same thing twice, and the simple control scheme is something anyone can pick up... though mastering it is a different matter. Though the game will allow you to customise your keys, it won't allow you to use any controller other than an Xbox one, which is a bit of a bummer. Almost as big of a bummer as those frustrating pads that have to be opened with a downward sword-strike in midair that are often used as platforms.It's a game that demands a lot from you, and the myriad of enemies, obstacles, and traps crammed in most rooms feels punishing to say the least. Recovery items are hard to come by, and you'll need to do a lot of grinding to beef up your characters to be able to handle most of what the game throws at them. Certain character traits can also dramatically change how you play. It could be as simple as the charming sepia-toned hue the nostalgia trait paints everything, but it could also be the frustratingly large target having Gigantism turns you into. Oh, and don't think you can just avoid choosing any differently-abled heirs, since before long everyone has something, and speaking of which...Ultimately, Rogue Legacy's approach to genetic differences is going to be something you'll have to make up your own mind how to feel about, and different life experiences and perspectives means everyone has the right to feel their own way. In a lot of ways, however, its inclusion of characters like this feels important, since how often do \"disabled\" people ever feature in games at all, much less in the starring role? How do you decide what's more insensitive... implementing a disability in a game, or ignoring that they exist altogether? The screenshot here, for example, is not a mistake but what happens when you get a character who suffers from vertigo. Is that offensive? What about when the game mimics the same near-sightedness I suffer from by making everything around your character nauseatingly blurry?That, of course, is purely a matter of personal choice and opinion. As far as its gameplay goes, however, Rogue Legacy is at the same time both exceedingly difficult in the way that makes me wonder if I insulted the developer in a former life, and yet also exceedingly addicting. It's filled with surprises and challenges that will keep you coming back for more no matter how hard it knocks you down. It looks beautiful too, with detailed and vibrant pixel art that changes in new and unexpected ways depending on who you're playing as, and the whole presentation, gameplay included, makes me feel like I'm playing something from the SNES-era... with teeth. Though certain aspects of it are bound to be polarising, any action fan with a fondness for challenge will still want to make a date with the demo at the very least. Rogue Legacy is brutal, but clever, and however you feel they handled the inclusion of everything from physical disabilities to tongue-in-cheek sexuality, I'd hope we can all agree that inclusion in general for players of all types is something we could use a bit more of from games in the future.Windows:\nDownload the demo\nOrder the full version (via GOG)Mac OS X:\nNot available.Try Boot Camp or Parallels or CrossOver Games.^ Scroll Up | Homepage >Good review :)\nI got addicted to the demo a few weeks ago, bought everything I could, maximized everything etc. I still haven't bought the full version yet though.I just bought this game, and I must say I'm fairly disappointed. The game is not so much difficult as it is tedious. My biggest beef is your ability to attack: it is insanely hard to hit something above or below you. Likewise, turning to strike something immediately behind you causes you to turn into the enemy and take damage. Maybe half of the damage I take is from moving (or dodging) into an enemy I can't hit.All this game has really successfully done is make me appreciate certain aspects of other games.Sorry, Brian. Maybe you should have checked out the demo first to make sure it was your taste. :) Personally, I feel the classic approach to gameplay mechanics is the whole point of it, and spells and knowing when to duck and run meant I could handle enemies from any angle.@BrianZuro, The game is supposed to be unfair. It's a throwback to the classic rpgs and adventures.UpdateLeave a comment [top of page]All games mentioned or hosted and images appearing on JayIsGames are Copyright their respective owner(s).All other content is Copyright ©2003-2018 JayIsGames.com.

      "The internet is buzzing with excitement for the indie title ‘Rogue Legacy‘ after recently being approved by Steam’s ‘Greenlight’. With over 100,00 YouTube views and thousands of gamers backing the project on the social bookmarking site Reddit, the game has definitely caught our attention.The games graphics is reminiscent of the classic ‘Ghosts and Goblins‘ but it adopts a ‘rogue-like’ game-play mechanic, meaning every game is different. Mix that with a selection of humorous children with such ailments as color blindness and irritable bowel syndrome, and you have all the ingredients of a fantastic gameI managed to drag the Lee brothers away from their final tweaks and test to ask them a few questions about their latest title, the journey and game development in general.Hey, my name’s Teddy Lee, and I’ve been making games with my brother Kenny on and off for about 5 years now?But before working with my brother, I’ve been making games on the side since I was probably around 6, first working with Pen and Paper, and then going up to RPGMaker and other things. Left on my own, I’d probably still be making games with RPG Maker since I can’t code or draw for my life.I don’t remember a time when I didn’t want to get into games, so it’s hard to say.  But there are a few developers that I look up to. Shigeru Miyamoto for sure because he’s constantly on the creative forefront. Pikmin, Zelda, Mario, Nintendogs. All of those games are completely different from one another, and they all spawned their own franchises and genres.Kenny wrote the game entirely in C#, using XNA. It’s a custom engine, so he did a massive amount of work for this game. The largest by a fair margin.The game sort of came together in pieces. We had the general idea for a children mechanic, but we tied everything together in a pretty fluid fashion.  It’s pretty exciting, working on a game for a year, hitting a block, and then trying to design your way out of it. Not really.  It’s pretty horrifying, and definitely leads to nightmares, but that’s how we roll I guess.1.5 years.  My brother worked on it full time, and I worked on it part time up until about 3 months ago. We’ve also hired artists and musicians down the way.Glauber Kotaki is our amazing Pixel Artist.Gordon McGladdery is our musician and sound technician. He makes some amazing stuff.Judson “Tettix” Cowan is another musician on the game, and we’ve worked with him on our other projects. He is always top tops.The children are randomly generated, you get to pick from 3 every time you die, so there’s no real limit.  I guess there’s a theoretical limit but I don’t know the math.Children are composed of 3 major modifiers.CLASS – Each child has their class preference, so you could be like a Knight, or an Assassin, or a Mage, etc. All classes have base modifiers applied to them, as well as their own custom “special ability”.  So a knight can block with his shield, and he has very strong base stats.  An assassin has low health, but a really high critical chance, and he can become smoke, allowing him to walk through enemies.SPELL – Each child has their own preferred spell, so you don’t go into a game with your choosing. And there’s a bunch of spells, and certain spells are locked to certain classes.TRAITS – A child can have upwards of 2 traits. So you could be both nearsighted and color blind which would be brutal.  Or you could be Endomorphic (fat so you don’t get knocked back far), and Gigantic, making you this immovable giant.All of these are applied onto a child, making every play through unique.We just come up with them as we go along.  Some of them we come up accidentally due to a bug in the game, which we then polish off into a feature.The games not made of levels. When you enter the castle the castle is always different, so it’s not like you beat the castle, and then level 2 starts.  There’s defined zones and bosses, but we don’t want to say how many just yet.Just getting the game to where it is now has been quite the challenge. There is so much in the background running in this game that’s easy to take for granted. For example, there’s a dynamic scaling system, which works into the Procedural Map Generation.  There’s a drop system, a chest system, economy links, and this whole slew of other stuff, which all tie into the Procedural Map, with their own rule sets and what not.  We put a lot of time into making the game as “fair” as possible. If we just let the game build itself without any checks and balances, it’d be all over the place.Every time you die, your castle is rebuilt from the ground up. Each room spawns their own set of enemies based off a logic system, they scale dynamically to the castle, and on top of that, bonus rooms and room linking is all applied dynamically to this system as well. We do have some “special” logic rules built into the game world which will help people recognize patterns in the randomness, but they were all implemented purposefully.Never make a game PURE random. PURE random is bad design. Controlled randomization is very important.\nAlso, never mistake procedural as an easy way out. It’s a lot more work then expected.There’s some feelers, but nothing confirmed yet.Well, either a new game, or bankruptcy. We’ve made this game with our own money so if it doesn’t do well, we’re pretty much screwed…But we do have plans in the future if we can sustain ourselves. A couple of projects that we had stopped previously for budget reasons and such.Also, hopefully we get an Oculus Rift.  We’ve been waiting forever for our kit. And we had some really cool things we wanted to try out on that.Make a small game and finish your small game. There’s a huge difference between almost finishing something and actually finishing it.\nAlso, don’t try to do something “better” than someone else.  Be original.  Otherwise it’s just a quality battle, and there will always be teams bigger than you.No idea. We are so thankful to the Reddit community for picking it up the way they have.\nWe do plan on releasing a HD version of the trailer someday.  It looks way better running at 60fps then it does at 30 (YouTube cap).Rhianna Pratchett is currently one of the most revered writers in video games.

      "In 2013, Canadian developer Cellar Door Games released an amazing Steam game called Rogue Legacy that combined the action-platforming of classic Castlevania games with the hardcore challenge and randomness of the Rogue-like genre. But Rogue Legacy features a much more approachable difficulty than many Rogue-likes, technically making it a Rogue-lite.At last, Rogue Legacy has made its way to Xbox One courtesy of the ID@Xbox program. Now Xbox players can control a family of adventurers with randomized traits as they explore an equally randomized (and deadly) castle. Each character has only one life to live, but the fallen heroes' money will finance upgrades that carry over to their descendants.Read our in-depth review with video to see what makes Rogue Legacy such an amazingly addictive game!The game begins with a sepia-colored playable prologue. A mysterious knight navigates a small portion of the castle and attacks the king he finds within. Who is this knight, and why would he attack the king? It will take a lot of adventurings to find out!Although Rogue Legacy owes some lineage to Metroidvania games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, it doesn't feature nearly as intricate a narrative as Symphony. The focus here is on exploration. But as your many heroes explore the castle, they will sometimes discover journals that shed some light on the plot. By the time you read the 25th and final journal entry, you'll have seen what led the author to go rogue.After the prologue ends, you'll select from three randomly generated adventurers called heirs. Each varies in many ways, including gender, appearance, class, spells, special techniques, and traits.Class determines the character's primary strengths and weaknesses. Barbarians have the most life and deal a fair amount of physical damage, but cast weak spells. The Shinobi deals the most damage but has low life, miners earn extra gold and can see the location of every chest on the map, etc. Many of the ten classes must be unlocked through manor upgrades.The most fun (and sometimes frustrating) aspect of Rogue Legacy's character randomization is the trait system. Each character can have one or more attributes that affect gameplay to varying degrees. A few examples:Once a character dies, you'll have to choose from a new batch for your next run. This ability adds a wonderful element of variety. The downside to the system is that you won't always like the characters available to you. Your preferred class or classes might not come up in the rotation, forcing you to play a less desirable class.Sure, you can always just kill off an unwanted character and hope the next batch will be better. But that's a hassle, and my only real complaint about the game. The Randomize Children manor upgrade alleviates the problem though. It lets players re-roll the character selection once, essentially providing six heirs to choose from instead of three.The castle our family of adventurers seeks to explore consists of five regions: entrance, Castle, the Forest, Maya (attic), and Land of Darkness (dungeon). Although the rooms and traps you'll encounter are randomized, the positions of the regions will always be roughly the same. You'll find the Maya at the top of the overall map, the Forest to the right, etc.The entrance hosts a magically sealed door that leads to the final boss. To open it, you'll have to defeat the bosses of the other four regions. Of course, the bosses have lots of life and deal tremendous damage, so it will take the right combination of upgrades, pattern memorization, and class selection to defeat them. You can also fight super tough remixed versions of each boss after randomly receiving the appropriate items from shrines.Although the layout of the castle typically changes with each run, players can pay the Architect outside the castle to lock the previous design in place.Each heir's secondary goal is to collect as much gold as possible. When he or she dies, you can then spend that money on upgrades to the family manor. Whatever money doesn't get spent will be taken by Charon upon entering the castle, so spend freely.Some manor upgrades unlock new classes or permanently upgrade existing classes. Others boost physical and magic damage, defense, health, gold gained, and more. The manor system is key to Rogue Legacy's appeal, as it ties the game together and keeps players coming back for more.Players can also spend gold to unlock weapons, armor, and runes permanently. The runes grant unique abilities like extra jumps, dashing, vampirism (gain health from killing enemies), and more. All of these allow you to customize playstyle and gain an edge over opponents. The catch is that equipment blueprints and runes must be discovered in special chests throughout the castle. You'll usually have to defeat minibosses or complete challenging rooms to open those chests.Don't worry if you haven't bought every upgrade and found all the equipment before defeating the final boss. All permanent upgrades carry over to New Game+ mode, so you can keep on collecting and upgrading. After beating New Game+, you'll start New Game++ and so on. Enemies and traps become progressively harder with each trek through the game.Rogue Legacy offers 29 Achievements worth 1,000 Gamerscore. All of their names end with –philia or –phobia, the love and fear of something. Funny, but not as easy to understand as traditional Achievement names.'Thanatophobia' – beating the game on a fresh save in 15 lives or less, initially seems like the hardest Achievement. Luckily, you can use a gold farming exploit to buy tons of upgrades and make things easier. Check out this guide for details.The Achievement for beating the game twice is problematic at the moment. It should unlock simply for beating New Game+. Right now, you have to beat both the main game and New Game+ in a single session, which is a big hassle. The developers have promised to fix the issue with an upcoming update.Finally, the hardest Achievements involve beating the remixed bosses. They are annoyingly hard, and each one might require an hour or more of attempts to beat. At least the game lets players retry the remixed bosses instantly upon failing.So far, Rogue Legacy holds the crown of my favorite downloadable game of the year. I've played through it on Steam, Vita, and now Xbox One without ever losing interest. It really is nearly a perfect game.With a relatively low budget, Cellar Door Games has created a game that easily rivals more expensively produced titles like Ori and the Blind Forest. The tight action-platforming gameplay, challenging enemies and castle layouts, and addictive upgrade system just never get old. All platforming fans should pick up Rogue Legacy and start their own lineage of adventurers.",
      "Games like: Castlevania, Ghosts ‘n Goblins, Dark SoulsTL;DRKing of kings, point thy sword towards the sky and storm the castle filled with zombies, goblins and terrors of all kinds. Rogue Legacy takes the classic adventure platformer with an ever changing dungeon to keep you and your following lineage on their toes as you defeat the ill fated monsters that inhabit it. Right the wrongs done from your great-great-great-great… (this could go on for a while) and rid the evil that has taken over.Toronto developer, Cellar Door Games, takes a few simple concepts that have seen their days in the sun and combine them into a new experience. You have a compelling storyline, very interesting characters, and an ever changing dungeon with some RPG elements sprinkled in for good measure.Rogue Legacy takes full advantage of Steam’s “Big Picture Mode” allowing seamless control from your favorite game pad. In this instance the Xbox 360 controller is the main display. Through a simple title screen, you can pick between the keyboard or the Xbox controller by pressing one of corresponding buttons on screen. From here your onscreen actions will be displayed depending on your option.As a lone knight who values his own glory above all others charges the castle, he’s able to slip in undetected and slay the king by a blade to the back. This is the beginning of our story. Time has past and now it’s up to you, the heir of this vengeful knight, to reclaim the castle that is now overrun by monsters. As you journey inside, the castle is separated into four different areas all needing to be completed before opening the final door to the main boss. Each of these areas increase in difficulty as you would expect so don’t go wandering just willy-nilly. These guys pack a punch and will take you down quickly.Instead of lives collected over time, you extinguish through your lineage. After dying, you’ll be presented with three different children to continue with. Each choice has different positives and negatives to the game play. These can range from being smaller to sink through tiny spaces, not being knocked back when hit or have nearsightedness where the surrounding area will be fuzzy and difficult to see. They also have different weapons and specials that will influence how you proceed through the dungeon. Picking the right choice will aide in getting further into the world. All of these character elements are randomized so choose wisely. Not the one called “wisely” but just use your best judgement to your play style. You know what I mean.As you journey through, you’ll collect gems and gold to add to your coffers at the end of a turn. This gold can be used to purchase new segments of your very own castle upgrading hit points, specials and also a blacksmith, an enchantress and an architect for use of their own services. Finding blueprints throughout the levels will unlock new items to purchase from the blacksmith such as armor and sword upgrades. The enchantress does much the same except for your magic attacks and mana level. The architect is what will keep you from going insane heir after heir. He has the ability to “lock down” the dungeon to keep the layout the same after each death. The dungeon layout changes every time making it more difficult to replay the same areas to make progress. Sure, you’ll play some of the same rooms here and there, but the roguelike of level design can become frustrating after a quick death from a simple fall. Giving the architect 60 percent of your gold gives you the chance to replay the same dungeon once again.Got any gold left after all of the upgrades, the blacksmith and the architect? Good! Now you get to give what’s left to Charon, a hooded figure that stands before the castle gate only allowing entry after paying him what’s left in your pockets. At first, this may not seem like a huge problem since all of the upgrades for your characters are at a small cost. But as the game proceeds, the weapons and armor start to cost more and more and sometimes you just won’t have enough to get that new magic ability. Having to fork over all of your gold to re-enter the castle leaves you with taking the time to destroy furniture, open chests and eventually journey outward to collect more gold for the next time around.Rogue Legacy does exactly what you’d expect it to. Having the default abilities of jumping and sword swiping, you have the RPG elements to customize your character to fight the way you deem fit but still have that sense of randomization with each new heir you take control. You’ll become familiar with certain specials and types of game mechanics which will make it more challenging to have to pick one that doesn’t have those traits requiring you to rethink the levels you previously fought through. With the added danger of the huge increase in difficulty once exploring outside the castle to the other areas, you’ll spend more time with what you are familiar with to really beef up your family tree. It may look and feel like you can just run through mashing buttons, but the AI and level design will make you pay for that one character who jumps just a little bit slower or their sword just doesn’t extend enough like you were expecting. These small elements make Rogue Legacy a very challenging one indeed.Rogue Legacy at its core is an adventure platformer with an ever changing dungeon full of monsters, ghosts and zombies to kill. Scattered throughout are furniture that can be destroyed, chests to be opened and enemies that leave gold ripe for the taking. These can then be turned into upgrades that customize your characters to give a nice sprinkling of RPG. A fast paced, sometimes painstakingly difficult level design, brings a hopeful look at what roguelikes can be instead of a typical top-down RPG clicker.Check out more pics from Rogue Legacy.So do I!

      "If a wizard climbed in my window tonight and gave me a big quest to do, I’d have to turn him away. What if I had to change my contact lenses in the middle of a fight with an imp king? What if there were no toilet facilities on my adventure? Does this wizard want me to get an eye infection? No thanks, you wizard, back out the window with you. People with crap eyesight aren’t cut out for adventures, yet Rogue Legacy is a game all about generations of such uniquely gifted, syndrome-bedraggled and disorder-ridden explorers venturing deeper and deeper into a rogue-like-ish, randomly generated, treasure-laden castle. It’s fun!Rogue Legacy doesn’t have a point at which is makes any sense to stop playing. You pick your hero from a set of three, each with their own genetic flourish, run into the castle to hack up some eyeballs and wolves, collect gold and die. In death, everything you collected is bestowed upon your heir, another player-chosen hero with their own traits, who can spend that cash on new stat upgrades or equipment. That equipment is sold right outside the castle’s entrance, and as lifespans are so brief in Rogue Legacy, it would seem imprudent to not run right back into the keep and test out your new sword and cape.And so the game loops around like a sexy ouroboros bastard, with generations of adventurers perishing and newer, stronger heroes emerging from their ashes. At no point does quitting feel like anything but a massive imposition. To call this game’s sense of progression “carrot on a stick” would be misleading, because Rogue Legacy gives you more carrots than you can handle. It’s a trail of lovely carrots leading up a spiral staircase. Yeah.The few dozen possible traits you can find your hero with are less important than you’d think. Some are immediately apparent, such as vertigo, which flips the screen upside down. ADHD makes you move more quickly, dyslexia scrambles any text you encounter, baldness simply makes the word ‘balding’ appear on loading screens. Spotting new traits and figuring out their effects is fun, and once they begin to repeat you’ll start to have to balance negative disorders against a class’s innate strengths and abilities. Would you rather a gold-mining Spelunker with irritable bowel syndrome, or an Archmage with an obscured HP bar owing to a lack of pain receptors?You don’t have to think too hard about your choice of hero, as for the first few hours of play they’ll be lasting mere handfuls of minutes inside the castle. Traits aren’t passed from parent to child either, rather they’re generated at random, so you needn’t worry about spawning a legacy of wretched, flatulent adventurers, or trying to eugenics up a master race of hypergonad assassins. Positive traits exist alongside neutral and negative ones too, allowing for a roll of the dice to set you up with an ideally overpowered hero.But more important is the adventuring itself. The randomised castle interior is divided into the keep, the forest, the tower and the dungeon, with each area always remaining roughly in one corner of the map and hosting monsters of increasing strength. Hundreds of individual rooms are designed by hand, with objects and enemies randomly dispersed around them, and these rooms are then scrambled and arranged in an unpredictable manner. Some rooms are rarer than others, presenting challenges in the form of spike pits and awkward disappearing platforms that you must trigger with downward strikes. Even after six hours in Rogue Legacy, the castle continued to present rooms I hadn’t seen, alongside more familiar rooms through which I could more comfortably navigate.Multiple paths naturally form through the conjured schematics of the castle, allowing you to bypass tougher areas, though it’s often in the more challenging rooms that treasure chests are kept. Certain chests present an objective for the room in which they reside, sometimes requiring you to take no damage, or to reach the chest without jumping, and often requiring the use of certain rune abilities, such as the double jump, which you either have equipped or you don’t. Those special chests contain blueprints for the armourer or runes for the enchantress, vendors outside the castle walls who’ll turn your gold into useful equipment.The combination of equipment and runes allows for distinct builds too. For example, restoring HP in Rogue Legacy is difficult, with chicken drumsticks oh so rarely popping out of destroyed furniture, so by stacking vampirism runes, weapons and armour early in my game I could soak up HP with each kill, prolonging my life and allowing me to scoop up more cash with each trip to the castle. The tradeoff was a massive cut in strength, but it speaks to Rogue Legacy’s intelligent design that either method is viable given the correct class and trait.That clever design seeps back into features like the architect, who locks down the previous castle design (for a penalty of 70% gold found) to allow you to attempt to tackle a tricky room for a second time. Any gold not spent is forfeited upon re-entering the castle too, preventing you from amassing wealth. Enemy desigs see animations betraying upcoming attacks while satisfyingly physical knockbacks and predictable movement patterns support real finesse of control (it’s got nice jumps). Rogue Legacy is Castlevania degrees of difficult though, and if you can’t grasp the finer points of the game’s platforming and sword swinging you might find yourself on the painfully grinding side of the game’s bell curve, accruing mere pittances and getting nowhere.Once you get past the game’s first score of demoralising deaths you’ll begin to see your abilities blossom, however. Better classes of higher level hero become available with enough gold spend, and even the game’s basic systems begin to relent as you progress: you can cheat death, maximise your gold yield, weaken all enemies and even retain some cash between generations.The pace is arduous to begin with, which can be offputting, but death is of so little consequence in Rogue Legacy that you’ll burn through entire lineages in pursuit of your next trinket. Generation after generation will perish, and all of their foibles will wash over you as if they were naught but pips in this roguelike’s bitter lemonade cocktail of death. If this game sets out to teach us anything it’s that, in spite of our tiny differences, we’re all largely similar in the face of a bigger objective, unless you’re a Lich King, in which case you’re better than most people, or unless you’ve got vertigo, in which case you’re shit.You can buy it here.ShareClicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.PromotedHow to master Monster Hunter: World’s deep combat system7 reasons you should return to RuneScape and Old School RuneScapeWhy a visit to Monster Hunter: World should be your videogame summer vacation",
      "From Shart inducing IBS to short sighted knights, Cellar Door Games’ new indie platformer Rogue Legacy was always going to be a comedic game. Unfortunately, comedy maybe one of the only things going for it…There is no multiplayer nor split screen so already the platformer is limited. Players start the game years ago in the time where they play the rogue knight who assassinates the king (you assume because you’re not actually told what the hell you’re doing). Essentially, players  just bash monster, jump, bash again and the oh hi Kingy bash. The End.Or well that’s where it should end, because you then play a knight who storms the castle years later to bring the monsters to justice, or so you think because you’ll probably get to the third enemy and then die; die again and again and again. That’s the plot. Each life you start as a descendant from the last knight you played as, there are three classes which are NOT promising, you may as well stick as the archmage not as if you get a choice because all the other classes suck so much that they are not worth mentioning.However, that’s what players will feel at the start of the game.At the beginning of each life you will spawn at a manor which you can upgrade and spend your hard earn coins on, so levelling up, different abilities and you can buy special characters. This is when the game gets interesting…Let’s talk about these characters, they’re not playable they’re extras, the blacksmith can get you weapons and armour but you have to find blueprints for him which are very rare. So he’s useless for a start. Next up is the Enchantress a gypsy who can give you special abilities; although you need to find her runes. Tough tits there then. The last guy, he’s somewhat helpful but as you get more experience it turns out he’s just as crap as the other two; the Engineer. His overrated ability is to freeze the random dungeons of the castle; so you know where the chests and enemies are and you know what rooms to avoid. But he’ll charge 60% of what you find. If you keep moving in the random system you’ll earn more coin and the chests won’t have already been opened.Players will also know where the bosses are, however it’s doubtful you’ll stick with the game long enough to build your level high enough to defeat them. They do vanish though once they’re defeated, IF they’re defeated. Fundamentally you can find them in half a minute, but it’ll take hours for you to try and rank up to defeat them.There is currently a huge market for indie platfomers I.E. Fez and Towerfall Ascension but they are good games, this has been hailed by critics but for the wrong reasons. Yes the random dungeons adds a refreshing replay value but it dosn’t do what games should do. You don’t scream when you die, instead you grit your teeth select your next knight and carry on hoping to do a little better, or you turn it off and play a multiplayer game.Already have it? Let us know what you think!Khdir the Gatekeeper, the first and final boss if you can’t be arsed to get past him.We're just a team of nerds who spend our lives scouring the internet for the most entertaining gaming content.",

    "title": "Risk of Rain",
    "text": [
      "Risk of Rain is a platform video game incorporating both Metroidvania and roguelike elements, developed by a two-student team from the University of Washington under the name Hopoo Games. The game, initially a student project, was funded through a Kickstarter campaign to improve the title, and was published by Chucklefish to Microsoft Windows in November 2013. OS X and Linux versions premiered as part of a Humble Bundle in October 28, 2014. Ports for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, developed with assistance from Code Mystics, were released on April 12, 2016.\nThe player controls the survivor of a space freighter crash on a strange planet. As the player progresses through levels, selected randomly and with some procedural placement of objects within the level, they attempt to survive by killing monsters and collecting items that can boost their offensive and defensive abilities. The game features a difficulty scale that increases with time, requiring the player to choose between spending time building experience and completing levels quickly before the monsters become more difficult. By discovering various hidden locations, players can discover artifacts which can alter gameplay. The game supports up to four cooperative players in online play and up to two players in local play.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nAt the start of the game, each player selects one of twelve characters. Initially, only one character is available, Commando,  but as the player completes various in-game objectives, more characters become available. Each character has various statistics and a set of unique moves; for example, the sniper has the ability to hit creatures from a long distance for large, piercing damage but their firing rate is slow, while the commando can do rapid, moderate damage at close range.\nWithin all but the last level of the game, the goal is to locate a teleporter, placed in a random location. As the players hunt for it, they will encounter monsters; upon death, the monsters will drop in-game money and will also provide the players experience. As the players gain experience they will increase the player level, gaining more hit points and stronger attacks. Money can be used to open various chests, buy items at stores, activate attack drones that aid in combat, or pray at shrines that have a random chance of dropping items, described by game lore as the space freighter's cargo. There are over 110 items in the game, and these provide benefits such as passive bonuses that improve offensive or defensive capabilities, or a special usable with a cooldown. Players can only hold one useable at any time, but they can collect many passive items, including multiple versions of the same item, stacking the benefits of these items. The location of these items is randomly determined through roguelike procedural generation.\nOnce the players have found the teleporter, they activate it, starting a 90-second countdown on Drizzle (easy) and Rainstorm (medium) difficulty and a 120-second one on Monsoon (hard) and the players have to survive. During this time, many more monsters, including at least one boss character (if the Kin artifact is not active), will appear. After the countdown is over, no new monsters will appear but the players will have to defeat all remaining monsters before they can use the teleporter and proceed to the next level. At this time, any remaining money the players have is converted to experience points. At the penultimate level, the players have the option of taking the teleporter to the final level (the crashed ship), or to use the teleporter to run through much higher difficulties of previous levels so as to gain more experience and items; when this latter option is taken, the teleporter on these levels will allow the same choice to either proceed to the final level or continue through additional levels. On the final level, the player must fight a final boss character; if they survive, they are able to escape the planet and win the game.\nThe difficulty of the game is determined by a timer. The difficulty level increases every 5 minutes up through 10 levels, with newly spawned monsters having more health and stronger attacks. Additionally, boss characters may spawn before the players have found teleporters on higher difficulties. If playing alone, the game is over when the player dies. In multiplayer mode, a player that dies must wait until the other players survive to the next level, upon which they are brought back into play.\nThe item drops are based on the various progress the player has made in the meta-game through repeated playthroughs. For example, defeating certain boss characters for the first time will unlock an item that can then drop in future playthroughs. Other items are based on completing certain goals, such as winning the game a number of times, or performing specific goals with each of the characters. In Rainstorm or Monsoon modes, monsters will also rarely drop log books that describe the monsters; this itself is used to unlock more items and a playable character.\nThe last level, Providence is the boss and once he is beaten, the character of Sniper is unlocked and Mercenary can be unlocked if Providence is killed 4 times.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nRisk of Rain was developed by two students at the University of Washington, Duncan Drummond and Paul Morse, later releasing the game under the name Hopoo Games. The two took inspiration from their favorite games in the past and combined them into a single package, focusing primarily on the platformer and roguelike genres. They also wanted to add the idea of a game that scales in difficulty that \"puts the player in a sense of urgency and makes them make tough choices often\". Risk of Rain was developed using the GameMaker: Studio tool. The title Risk of Rain was selected not only to allow the game to be easily searchable via the Internet, but came to allude to the concept of a single protagonist in the large game world always worried about \"a risk of failure or bad things happening\".The original idea Drummond and Morse had for their game, which they started developing as sophomores, was a tower defense where the difficulty of the attacking creatures would rise with the distance that they were from the defense point, but they found that players would opt to avoid venturing from that point. They sought to find a means to force the player to keep moving and came to the idea of \"difficulty = time\" concept. Though this is implemented so that it appears that the difficulty increases every five minutes to the player, internally, a difficulty counter is incremented every minute as to create an apparently smoother transition to the player. This counter translates into a semi-exponential growth in newly-created enemies' attack strength, a semi-logarithmic growth in these enemies' health points, and a logarithmic growth in the rate that the player's health increases with character level. Drummond and Morse found this created favorable gameplay that created moments of \"highs and lows\" and keep the player on edge, having times where the player may feel overpowered to the enemies and moments later find themselves in a struggle to stay alive. Another mechanic they had explored with the \"difficulty = time\" approach was to incorporate the speed at which the player defeated enemies into the difficulty counter, but found this removed the \"highs and lows\" in the game.Another element of the difficulty approach was the rate which enemies are generated. The game uses an artificial intelligence (AI) system that \"buys\" enemies to spawn at random intervals using a point system; this AI is given points at a rate that scales with the difficulty counter. Enemies have point values, with more difficult enemies costing more points, and the AI will buy as many as it can. Due to limitations with GameMaker, Drummond and Morse found that having too many enemies spawn in stressed the game, so created a means for the AI to buy an \"elite\" enemy if it were to otherwise buy five of a single type; these elite enemies have additional attributes, such as higher attack values, and present a harder challenge to kill. They found this workaround created extra dynamism for the game, which Drummond called as \"a merge of game functionality and game design\". Risk of Rain was tested primarily to balance the difficulty system, and Drummon and Morse were aware that with all the available items to collect in the game, it is possible to \"break the game\" by acquiring specific combinations of item drops which would make the player overpowered or invincible. They believe this was still acceptable since this was highly tied to the game's random generator.The game is presented in 8-bit-like two-dimensional graphics. This economy of graphics allowed them to both develop sprites for new enemies easily, but also allowed them to give a sense of scale to the larger bosses compared to the player's character. Character designs were made to provide enough differences between classes, and to give abilities that relied on the player's skill to give the player satisfaction of playing well, such as introducing a damage boost on the sniper's gun if the player times their reload appropriately.After completing most of the core game on their college budgets, the Hopoo Games team turned to Kickstarter to gain additional funds to update the game to the latest version of GameMaker, obtain a musician to provide music for the game, and additional quality control. The Kickstarter was launched in April 2013 seeking $7,000, and ended up with more than $30,000 in backers. This allowed them to get Chris Christodoulou to compose the game's soundtrack and add several additional gameplay features to the title. The success of the Kickstarter led to a publishing partnership with Chucklefish, providing them server space and forums for the game's players. They would later gain help of Matthew Griffin, from Yeti Trunk, another developer that has worked with Chucklefish, to help improve the game's multiplayer code.The Hopoo team announced in February 2014 that they were working with Sony Computer Entertainment America to bring the game to the PlayStation Vita. With assistance from Code Mystics, Hopoo announced that the game will also come to the PlayStation 4 alongside the Vita version; these versions will support an online matchmaking system and the ability for two local players to join with other online players. The PlayStation versions also support cross-platform play, enabling both PlayStation 4 and Vita players to play together.\n\n\n=== Sequel ===\nIn May 2017, Hopoo Games announced that they had been working on a sequel Risk of Rain 2 over the previous 6 months. The game is expected to maintain the same core loop as the first game. While the game was still at the early stage of development and other features might change, Hopoo affirmed that they were transitioning the game from 2D to 3D, as the 3D option provided \"much deeper design spaces and more possibilities for cool gameplay\" as well as more ways to artistically express themselves. When they started development on the sequel, Hopoo started with a 2D-based prototype with the player in control of one of the monsters in the first game, as to mix up the formula for the sequel. Part of the addition for this was inspired by Risk of Rain fan art that showed the various objects the player collected shown on the character, and Hopoo wanted to use this approach for the sequel, but the 2D graphic approach did not give them enough visual space to work with. They transitioned the prototype from 2D to 2.5D, representing the character in 3D graphics but otherwise playing as a 2D platformer, but when they completed that, they felt it was better to move the game fully to 3D, with the transition being relatively quick to complete. The sequel will use the Unity engine, which Hopoo had to learn for this, as well as the time in developing the 3D worlds.The sequel will bring back most of the same classes of characters and monsters from the first game, but with modified or new abilities reflecting differences between 2D and 3D. Hopoo explained that some monsters that were difficult to avoid in the original game due to their size could easily be kited around with the added space of 3D, so they added additional attacks for these monsters to make them more difficult. The 3D maps are anticipated to be large-enough worlds with random placement of the end-goal teleporter and items such that they do not expect to have to add in level permutations as the first game had used, since the large maps will provide enough variety that players will not likely experience the complete level in one playthrough. Hopoo plans to improve the multiplayer options, including using Steam peer-to-peer connectivity, matchmaking including private matches, and split-screen play.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn February 2015, Hopoo Games partnered with IndieBox, a monthly subscription box service, to offer a physical release of Risk of Rain. This limited, individually-numbered, collector’s edition included a flash-drive with a DRM-free game file, the official soundtrack, an instruction manual, Steam key, and various custom-designed collectible items.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRisk of Rain was named one of the Student Showcase winners of the 2014 Independent Games Festival, and subsequently won the Student Prize Award.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

We were just two college students working out of our dorms in our free time, doing something we loved — making and playing games!Three years later, Hopoo Games and Code Mystics have partnered up to send Risk of Rain to PS4 and PS Vita! While PC gamers will be familiar with Risk of Rain, we have a few new features to the game’s online system — exclusive to PlayStation owners.Thanks to the PlayStation Network, we now have automatic matchmaking integrated into Risk of Rain. With just one press of a button you’ll be automatically placed into a lobby with up to three other players around the world — no IP address or port forwarding required. Just online fun.But what would Risk of Rain be without playing with friends? Now you can play on the couch, and on the internet — all at once! While we still have the four-player local co-op available in Risk of Rain, you can now play online lobbies while sharing a machine with your friend — up to two per machine. Wanna just play online instead? You can also invite your friends into your lobby through PSN to get all your game buddies into one lobby.“But Duncan, what if my friend is on PS Vita and I’m on PS4?” No worries — we know that people prefer playing on their own platform, so now we also have cross-platform online support between PS Vita and PS4. That means that both a player sitting on the couch on his PS4 and a player on the bus playing on his PS Vita can enjoy Risk of Rain chaos — together.These changes are all aimed at letting Risk of Rain do what it’s best at — a fun, but brutally hard time with friends. With automatic matchmaking, local co-op integration with online lobbies, and cross-platform support, we’re hoping that the online experience is the best possible for players.And for all our new PlayStation fans — thank you so much for your support, and prepare to die. A lot.See you on the planet.PastuleioApril 14, 2015 in Featured, Media, News, Uncategorized1 Comment »Hey guys!Risk of Rain version 1.2.8 is now live for Windows players and will be live for Mac/Linux hopefully later this week!

The Arena mode we said on Kickstarter was a cool idea before the game was finished. When we added that stretch goal, we didn’t plan to be able to ‘loop’ the game forever; once we added that in, the Arena mode seemed a bit… redundant. However, it wouldn’t be fair to do nothing, so to replace that, we decided to simply add 2 new classes and 10 new items in the same patch.ya comin @ ur face soon®-hopoohopooJune 18, 2014 in Featured, Media, News2 Comments »Hey guys! Sorry for not updating for like… you know, 5 months. After we got into our major, college classes took up a lot more time than expected. Not a good excuse, but an honest one. Sorry.Despite what people think, we actually have NOT escaped to Cuba to live a life of luxury. We have a lot of Risk of Rain stuff coming. The most important is moving Risk of Rain from GameMaker 8 to GameMaker Studio. What does this mean? Well,The current timeline is planned to be:Why is the Arena mode after all the above? The reason is because we have actually been throwing around the idea of a PvP mode (Risk of Rain style), and we wanted to first see if latency is reduced in the upgrade to GM:S. If not, no worries; the previous plans continue.Hope that clarifies where we are and where we are going. I’ll try to make an active effort to keep people updated from now on. Cheers.",
      "Excited to announce that Risk of Rain 2 will be playable at PAX West 2018 at the Indie Megabooth!If you’re visiting at PAX, please come say hi and give our game a shot! :)I wouldn’t say low-poly, but more like mid-poly. It’s ~5k a character, and most enemy models use a baked normal map as well.We actually use a modified version of the deferred pipeline (so we can use a lot of point lights on projectiles, effects, etc.) We use one of our gbuffer channels as a reference to a ramp to remap our NdotL values to - so most character’s use a two-tone ramp, but the environment uses a very soft ramp. You can also use a ramp that doesn’t end in black for a fake subsurface effect. The effect is a bit subtle, but it adds a lot in terms of making characters contrast more. Below is an example of the character ramp (center) compared to 2 environment ramps (side). Take note on how the light terminates. Full size.I suspect this is the way BoTW also does their deferred pipeline, because of this bug that someone found.It currently has matchmaking and P2P through Steam - so no hamachi or port forward crap. At some point we want the option for people to host dedicated servers, but we haven’t fully explored that yetIt’s going well - we’re just quiet because we’re working on a couple of new exciting announcements! ~Stay tuned not-so-soonishly~That definitely did (and still does) happen.I think in theory it’d be nice if the director could realize this, but also in some ways it would be a bit demotivating if you did really well and the game “punished” you for it. In some ways, it’s your reward. But it would be nice if there was still a challenge.I think some light touches would be great, we just can’t think of any great calculations that wouldn’t go awry. Things like average monster count might be a decent indicator?Sorry! The updates take a better part of a few hours, plus the tax of switching from development mode to blog mode. A lot of the work we do is also not super flashy. Just know that long times between updates is just because we’re working really hard, and don’t want to get distracted. Here’s a random icon.We don’t really have a selection of characters that we’ve pre planned to be in the game, we sorta just make it up as we go along and see if the kit is interesting in 3D or the character its cool enough we can rework their kitHaving said that, I feel like the merc is the only melee class who can actually have the same kit and still work in 3d, assuming he can dash directionally. The fantasty is obviously for it to become a DmC style character with interrupts and juggles… but that’s probably not feasible with our skill level :xcurrently bosses drop an item for each player alive, and they’re all the same type when droppedThe aimlock is a special ability the Huntress has, along with being able to fire while sprinting - with the drawback that she has much shorter range than most other ranged charactersHiIt has been exactly 1 year (and 1 day) since we announced we were working on Risk of Rain 2.This update isn’t going to be about specific new systems or content, but about the overall cadence of development and what our goals are going forward.Where are we in development?A majority of the time spent in the last year was working on backend systems to better support the full game, and we feel that that is finally coming to completion. We are hoping to focus on content and polish throughout the next year, and prepping the game so it’s presentable to people, not just us internally.New classes, levels, items, monsters, bosses, and of course original ones from Risk of Rain have been added. With the core systems in place we are able to start designing new content that adds new layers on top of the existing loop for RoR1. We want to make sure that there is a lot of fresh new content that adds to the fun, and we are holding ourselves to a higher standard of game design than in our previous games. We are trying our best to make sure there isn’t a lot of filler items or monsters.Beta PlansSince announcing RoR2 we haven’t stopped getting emails or tweets asking about alpha/beta testing and how that is going to work. Because RoR2 is quite a complicated game, we will need to do a lot of testing for networking, progression, balance, and overall game feel.We are getting to a point in development where we are starting to plan out how we want to invite people to start testing RoR2 and help us build a community for the long term. This will most likely start off with a small/private closed alpha that people can sign up for via a website (that doesnt exist yet). We will also launch an official RoR2 discord once that time arrives, so people can talk about the game and give feedback directly.Based on the feedback of the closed alpha we will then plan our next steps depending on what requires more testing and feedback. Things like matchmaking require a large volume of people to properly test. We also have a couple new design directions that we want to hear lots of feedback for.Moving ForwardNow that we have a few games under our belts, we want to make sure Risk of Rain 2 is the best game we can possibly make and sustain. We want to include as many features as possible to build a growing community and continue to update the game into the future. Local co-op, online multiplayer with matchmaking, localization, discord servers and free updates are all things we think will help foster a community, but we would love to hear feedback on how we can keep the game active for the long haul. One of the most important things going forward is community engagement – and we will be opening up avenues for discussion later in development.We’ve posted a RAW JUICY video from one of our playtests, bugs and all, as a milestone of where we are in development. While it’s obviously still a work in progress, it is representative of the direction we are taking the game. Please let us know how you feel - it’s really important that we begin to collect community feedback as early as possible.Overall this has been a \nfantastic \n\nyear of development for us, and I really feel like we’ve begun to make a game that everyone will have a great time playing. I’m sure that we will exceed everyone’s expectations by the time we are done :)thx nerds",
      "JiG is on Patreon and Needs You! Click here for more informationI could probably accurately sum up my experiences with Hopoo Games's indie roguelike action RPG game Risk of Rain by adding the subtitle \"the review of many ragequits\" or maybe \"why you gotta hurt me so bad?\" After the cargo spaceship you were riding on is attacked and crash lands on a hostile alien planet, you find yourself the only survivor, and tasked with working your way through each dangerous area by scavenging what supplies you can from the debris (... as long as you can pay... ) and finding and activating the teleporter to take you to the next stage. The twist? You can't idly waste time grinding levels for as much as you want, since the longer you spend in game on a playthrough, the more difficult it gets, and trust me when I say there is very little out there that doesn't want to grind you into jam between its toes. Hope you like permadeath!The game's default controls are the [arrows] for climbing and movement, [spacebar] for jumping, and [Z], [X], [C], and [V] to activate your abilities. [Z] is typically your default attack and can be used over and over, but most other abilities will come with a cool down time between uses. The levels are completely randomised every time you play, so you have to scour every inch of them looking for the teleporter. Once activated, you'll have to survive for ninety seconds, which is easier said than done since activating it also summons a big angry boss monster to deal with, and when time's up, you still have to clear all the enemies from the area before moving on to the next stage. Fortunately, levels and items carry over between stages, though remaining cash is converted into experience points... as long as you don't die, in which case you'll have to start all over from the beginning.Destroying monsters, of which there are many, many, many kinds, nets you two very valuable things... experience points and cash. Experience points are self-explanatory, working towards upping your level and thus your damage and health. Cash, however, is just as important, since most of the cargo cases and chests littering the planet must be paid to be opened. You'll find all sorts of things, from powerful weapons, to items that grant you passive skills or bonuses, even drones that will help you fight. Death might be the end, but you'll also unlock even more item drops and entirely new characters with their own special abilities to play as, too.Analysis: By stripping away your ability to hang around mining levels, Risk of Rain forces you to move fast and adapt. If you wait too long, you'll find yourself swarmed by powerful enemies, but if you don't gain enough levels, you won't be ready to take on the portal boss. It's a delicate balance to try to get right, and thankfully the game has a demo for you to try since it won't be for everyone. It's nonstop action with a deliberately grueling difficulty curve, and it feels like an uphill battle every step of the way. Like all roguelikes, the element of randomness can either work for or against you, and here it's primarily down to the items you find. The right assortment of equipment can turn the tides enormously in your favour, and most players will quickly develop a preference after some experimentation. What might be more interesting is how drastically different the style of play can be between unlockable characters simply because of the few abilities they come with.The overall stage design is admittedly sort of bland, tending to consist solely of platforms and strings/ladders to climb. This actually can wind up getting tedious if you have to spend a lot of time crawling around a level looking for the portal or just trying to get around. Of course, if you have time to stand around complaining about the lack of environmental bells and whistles, you're not doing it right, and besides... there's a certain eerie beauty to a lot of the alien enemy designs. You'll get a lot of chances to admire them, too, since the game's idea of upping the difficulty is not only to spawn stronger enemy types, but to start barfing them at you in staggering numbers, usually while you're already running away from a giant electrocuting jellyfish boss monster. Though the actual game itself offers next to nothing in the way of a story, the descriptions of creatures you can find in Monster Logs paint a picture of a fascinating world.As hectic and vicious as Risk of Rain can be, however, it actually feels quite streamlined. It's designed to force you to keep moving, and the way dropped experience and cash will automatically be drawn to you no matter where you are means you never really have to slow down. It's not just about frantically running away from everything while spraying bullets behind you, since a lot of the bosses and lesser enemies require some strategy to take out quickly and efficiently with minimal damage. If you enjoy a challenge, roguelike action, tons of unlockable items and characters, and a retro aesthetic, Risk of Rain is definitely worth checking out... and the co-op play option allows you to tackle it with a friend, too.Windows:\n     \nGet the full version\nDownload the demoMac OS X:\nNot available.Try Boot Camp or Parallels or CrossOver Games.^ Scroll Up | Homepage >I remember when this was first announced on JiG, as a kickstarter project!Wow, to think it's finally become a fully fledged game. That's why I love this site, to see things like this from beginning to final. :)I can't put this game down! It really is just a lot of fun, and you will die, a lot. But it's okay, because when you do there's usually some new item unlocked for next time :DOne thing i will say is give it a fair shot. Seems very difficult at first but once you start unlocking a few items and get the hang of it it's very possible. I've put 22 hours into it so far and only beat it twice.There's also a ton of secrets to look for, and achievements to get (Getting achievements unlocks new items for use in future games.)And while i agree the actual design of the levels is a bit simple in terms of just platforms and ropes, they are all definitely beautiful to look at :)I only tried the demo so far, but I wasn't impressed enough to buy the full version. The tension between going fast vs. gaining levels and items is ruined by two things in my opinion:1. The bosses have so many hitpoints that you need to waste several minutes of precious time just standing there shooting at them to kill them.2. The teleporter could be in a few different spots so finding it quickly is mostly a matter of luck.Another problem is that the actual gameplay feels stale pretty quickly. Once you master spamming your four moves as appropriate, the same strategy works on every enemy. There are a lot of different items but they mostly just heal you or increase your damage, instead of changing how you play.Still a lot more fun than the average game, and I have great respect for anyone who can make a randomized/procedurally generated game.buy this game... seriously... its awesome. if you stole it... buy it anyway to reinforce the creation of more like it. Its simple in some ways but a polished gem with surprising depth.I'm mostly a troll... this game deserved a post.Its very roguelike... and it takes some time to get used to what \"works\" regardless of character. There is also luck involved with each play through like any roguelike. Some power ups will suit your character, playstyle, or are just better... but the synergy every time is like a whole nother adventure.Considering the way you play or want to play depending on your goal each time... you either rush... or quite the opposite. You can also ignore the \"time\" and increased difficulty as time passes to just get to \"god\"-like. On the hardest difficulty this is a rare but VERY satisfying feat to achieve. But there is a cap to how hard the game gets... if you're alive when you get there... you can keep repeating random maps to farm even more.I miss good 2d side scrollers like this gem... give it some time to get acclimated and if you like a challenge you'll be hooked for a while.As mentioned above... great unlocks / secrets / achievements. Each game is a new play through but you do permanently unlock characters and power ups. Some of those power ups really change the way you can play.I understand the \"stale\" comment... it does repeat itself in a way... but any rogue like has that to a point. The challenge ramping up and the difficulty to do a full run, or fun of the unlocks, far outweighs that being a negative to mep.s. updates have really improved any bugsUpdateLeave a comment [top of page]All games mentioned or hosted and images appearing on JayIsGames are Copyright their respective owner(s).All other content is Copyright ©2003-2018 JayIsGames.com.

      "Recently, a new demo for the ambitious shmup Risk System was released by developer Newt Industries. With each update, the title boasts new mechanics not seen within the genre. So, to get a real feel for the bold indie title, we got sat down with Chris Ekins, the game's leader developer -- and half of the developer studio.We got to talk about what's under the hood for the arcade shooter, as well as look inside the more intimate side of indie game development and its set of unique hurdles.GameSkinny (GS): When/how did the name Risk System pop into your head for this title?GS: Can you pinpoint when you realized you wanted to develop your own games?GS: Were there any specific games you looked at as inspiration for it? Those within the genre? Those outside of the genre?GS: Game development can be rather stressful. When during development, what activities do you participate in to offset that stress?GS: You're a skilled multi-talented artist and game developer. What other hobbies/skills did you incorporate interchangeably when developing?GS: With your latest demo, the music selection changed. Shmups generally use grand, soaring music. Can you explain why you decided to go a different route?Note: The prior demo featured music which was more ambient in nature. The music is now more pulsating. The change is to emphasize a feeling of engagement instead of passivity.GS: Recently, you implemented more quality of life features. Can you explain further why and how important it was to have this as an option?Note: halfCoordinated is a speedrunner that plays games one-handed because of hemiparesis. He's an advocate/consultant for gaming accessibility and a consultant.GS: From the ace pilot, her commanding officer, and more, all the characters appear to be women. Even in 2018, an entire female cast is rare. Were there any particular influences that inspired the story? Shows, books, etc?GS: The subject of game difficulty is touchy. It either scales, is ruthless from the start, or requires trial and error. How would you describe Risk System's approach?GS: Anything about game development you think would surprise people?GS: Any idea on a release window?Bonus question: What's your favorite game to wind down with?We'd like to thank Newt Industries for their insight and helping to fuel our excitement for a release soon. Fans of shmups and challenging games can check Risk System's newest demo here.Get Risk System news the moment it happens!",

      "By Philip Kollar\non December 24, 2013\n            at 1:00pmThat cargo plays an important role in setting Risk of Rain apart. It's presented in the form of chests that you can pay in-game money to unlock as you find them. Most chests contain an item, and most items modify your abilities and make you more powerful. There's obvious stuff like the bitter root, which increases your overall health by a certain percent. Then there's more interesting loot like the \"happiest mask,\" which causes a friendly ghost to spawn every time you kill an enemy. Each item is unique and though there are nearly 100, almost all of them are useful, so I rarely felt like I had wasted money opening a chest.It helps, also, that you can carry almost as many items as you want. You're only allowed a single usable item, but those are rare and generally not as important. Most items are passive and can be stacked for greater bonuses. The game keeps a running tally of which items you've found on the bottom of the screen, and in my best runs there would be three rows of these items and enough chaos on screen to cause the framerate to take a hit — in a way that was more satisfying than detrimental to gameplay. A huge collection of items always made me feel like a complete badass, which balanced perfectly with how much of a weakling I was at the start of every run.Of course, I couldn't become overpowered until I learned to survive long enough, which is a tricky task in its own right. The goal in each of Risk of Rain's 2D, pixel-art levels is to explore until you find a teleportation device, at which point you need to start it up and endure a 90-second onslaught of enemies before warping to the next level. I quickly learned that it's best to explore the large levels in full before activating the portal, so that I could gather as many items as possible. But the longer a run has gone on, the higher the difficulty level climbs, introducing greater numbers of enemies that are more powerful and aggressive. It creates a great tension between needing to explore more and needing to move quickly, and it means I was rewarded for learning the semi-randomized level layouts.But every time I became grounded and thought I was starting to master Risk of Rain, the game threw something new at me. Unlockable classes, in particular, mix things up. As it turns out, the commando is the game's vanilla class — with a relatively fast and powerful assault rifle as a weapon, abilities that allow him to push enemies back and the option to dodge out of the way when necessary. He's fun and totally viable for winning, but his mechanics are far from the full depth that the game has to offer.Other classes come with quirks that make them more difficult to master but often more fun. For example, the enforcer is an extremely slow class, but his close-range shotgun deals a lot more damage per blast, and his shield allows him to block all incoming damage if used wisely. The sniper can attack from extreme ranges and one-shot even the most powerful foes, but they're incredibly weak up close. Some later class unlocks are even melee-focused, which I can barely wrap my head around. New classes aren't just slight modifications to Risk of Rain; they completely change how you approach the game in ways that make replaying even more delightful.Those new classes are unlocked with the same method that you use to unlock new items: by accomplishing specific tasks. The sniper was my gift for completing the game the first time. Surviving for 40 minutes in a run unlocked \"the ol' lopper,\" an axe that allowed me to do bonus damage to enemies who were low on health. In addition to providing goals beyond simply beating the game, these unlocks gave me a constant feeling of progression, a welcome aspect to a game where dying wiped out most of my progress.Risk of Rain's lack of clarity regarding unlocks is less welcome. It has three initial difficulty settings — in order from easiest to hardest: drizzle, rainstorm and monsoon. Beyond just increasing the challenge, the game warns that \"progress will not be saved in this mode\" when selecting drizzle. But I spent a good three-fourths of my playtime in drizzle — which made it easier to get a handle on things and test out new classes — and unlocks absolutely were saved. Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful that my exploits on the easiest difficulty still allowed me to access more stuff; I'm just not sure if it was a bug or poor wording in the difficulty select screen or something else entirely.This lack of polish extends to a lot of smaller areas in Risk of Rain. Controller use is supported perfectly in-game but randomly doesn't function on some menus. The co-op option is fun but laggy and requires an archaic process of opening a port on your router to make it work. I even experienced a couple of hard crashes. In a game like this, a crash can cost as much as an hour or two of work; if you're far along in a run that's going really well, it's devastating.in Off-topic\nby mattwhite924in Off-topic\nby katnirtetin Off-topic\nby Kirielsonin Off-topic\nby Saliasin Off-topic\nby 'Shifter'© 2018 Vox Media Inc. all rights reserved •\n    Designed & Developed in housePartner site of The VergeAll Systems Operational\n  Check out our status page for more details.Game InfoPlatform\nWin, PS VitaPublisher\nChucklefish GamesDeveloper\nHopoo GamesRelease Date",
      "By\nAustin Wood\n2017-12-22T17:53:35.355ZDuncan \"Hopoo\" Drummond and Paul \"PaulTheGoat\" Morse started development on hit 2D roguelike Risk of Rain in their sophomore year at the University of Washington. It took them a year to finish Risk of Rain while going to school full-time. They've long since graduated and doubled down on their studio, Hopoo Games, but even so, Risk of Rain 2, already a year in development, is nowhere near done. It was announced as a 3D shooter earlier this year, but Hopoo has been tight-lipped ever since. So, when I got in touch with Drummond and Morse to get a much-needed status report, I had plenty of questions.Responses edited for clarity and length.It seems like Risk of Rain 2 was announced pretty quietly.Paul Morse: We waited a long time to announce anything. If we were doing a traditional sequel in 2D, it would have been much easier. Since we were switching to 3D it was kind of scary, never having done a 3D game and it being such a dramatic shift. We didn't want to give this half-assed \"we're doing 3D, it might work.\" We wanted to make sure it was a solid idea before showing anything, and it took quite a while to get to the point where we were even comfortable showing a screenshot or any assets.Duncan Drummond: Our team is really small. We don't have the luxury of having someone dedicated to keeping the hype going. We're working with a development blog because it's easiest for us. Hopefully as we get closer to launch, we'll start putting out trailers, putting out press kits. This is more of an announcement to the fans, \"we're working on this game, we didn't stop making games.\"And it is coming into some form now?PM: We've got it to a point where it's not super scary for us. We've gotten to a rhythm of creating characters, creating items.DD: I would say we've definitely hit a stride at this point where we're less about \"what direction are we going?\" and more \"what kind of content can we create?\"PM: Getting everything to that point took quite a while, but I think now that we're there we feel a little more comfortable showing things off.Why the shift to 3D?DD: Risk of Rain 2 didn't start off in 3D. We had a 2D prototype. The twist for that one was you played as the monsters in the previous game. We didn't want to make Risk of Rain but again. Something I personally really wanted was to be able to display items on your body. This was a key part of a lot of fan art that I saw, and also the cover art. Doing that in 2D was actually fairly difficult. It's just sprites. So we went from 2D to 2.5D just for the sake of being able to place these items on your body more easily. And by the time we were at 2.5D, we were like \"we're almost at 3D at this point, should we just give it a shot?\"PM: We had this 2D prototype for quite a while. But once we started talking about showing items and moving to 2.5D and then to 3D, it was pretty rapid.DD: Less than a month, I want to say.PM: Yeah, one week it was 2D, the next it was 2.5, and the next week it was 3D. And we were pretty much making the assets in 3D and showing them as a 2D thing, so it was kind of a waste. Once we transitioned to 3D, it was like, \"OK, we can actually do this if we want to.\" That's where it took off.DD: I would also say we hit our stride purely from experience. We just are not familiar with Unity. I've never modelled before this project, I purely used Paint for the previous game. It was a big jump for me to learn all the rules and how to actually do it. It was a mix of a lot of technical details along with skill level.PM: Our 2D games were our first 2D games, and with this transition to 3D, we've never worked in Unity or things like that. We've got to relearn everything before we start making games again. It's a pretty strange place to be but it's definitely paying off.What features were hardest to translate from 2D to 3D?PM: I would say the level design. In 2D it's pretty simple to go from a prototype of a level to making the tiles and putting them together and creating assets. But in 3D, it feels like you have one shot once you get into designing the level. And then prototyping in 3D is much more difficult. Do you use Lego? Do you use clay? Do you use other programs like SketchUp? Do you fully make this world in detail and then just make it again? That's been one of our harder points than a 2D version.DD: The cost of time per asset has gone up a lot. With our previous projects, we did a lot of our design via iteration. We would do a very rapid prototype and then refine it. But in 3D it doesn't work that way. A lot of times, if you want to change step two, you ruin every step afterward. You have to start over from scratch. You can't refine and iterate in the same way.I've seen some familiar enemies in your blog posts, but also new abilities.DD: We can't translate anything directly from 2D to 3D in terms of actual gameplay because it's so different. We've been reworking every monster that we've brought back. We found out melee monsters are actually much easier to beat in 3D because you have an entire dimension to kite them. So the golem, which was entirely melee, now has a laser attack. And the lemurian can now shoot fireballs. We also want to explore flying monsters. Now the wisps are actually flying. While they're still the same characters, they behave entirely differently.PM: Another reason we did this is because, early on, we wanted to make sure 3D is something viable and fun to play. That's always our main focus: is this going to be fun to play? We had the commando, the lemurian, the golem, these assets that were easy to create. We wanted to make sure that if this was Risk of Rain using those same assets, would it still be fun? And those base monsters were super important to solidifying the whole idea for us.DD: We were nervous about announcing the 3D project. We wanted to show players this is still Risk of Rain. Our first four monsters were from the original game because we wanted it to be recognizable. Since then, we've made some new ones, and I would say about half the current items are entirely new.PM: We wanted to make sure the fan base was comfortable after such a drastic change. We had to carefully mix in this familiar content while showing it's completely different.How were new and returning heroes affected by the jump to 3D?DD: A lot of abilities are suddenly useless or much more powerful because of range. You could only shoot within the screen in the original, but now that you can see off into the distance, a lot of abilities are a lot stronger because you can target different monsters, where before you were stuck shooting the front guy. Some abilities are also naturally more interesting in 3D. The Commando's FMJ, which shot in a straight line, would always hit everything in the line in 2D. But now you have to orient yourself in a line along the monsters to do that kind of damage.PM: In the first one it was kind of a free ability that would hit everything on the screen. In this one, it can be amazing if you line it up and use it right.DD: On the flip side, AoE abilities aren't as good in 3D because monsters can't occupy the same space. We found AoE has to have a large radius, or the AoE portion has to be about doing damage even if you miss rather than hitting multiple enemies at once.PM: We want to make sure this isn't a super precision-based game. The ability to just shoot and get all these items going is important. We aren't making the player focus on headshots 24/7.DD: We've also found a lot of movement abilities are more interesting with more freedom of movement. We have Huntress in a working state, and her blink is a lot more fun than in 3D because you can blink up ledges. You couldn't really aim that in 2D.PM: It creates a whole new kind of—DD: Dimension!PM: Dimension! With the Huntress being able to blink up and use abilities in the air. It's very dynamic based on where the enemies are, what attacks they're using.Is it still about fighting enemies, collecting items and finding the portal to the next level?DD: That loop is definitely the same. In the previous game we had permutations of the same stages. We're not sure how we're going to do that in 3D, or if it's even needed with the scale we have. One thing we've been focusing on is positional relevance. We're hoping we can make the random purchasable things more interesting based on where they spawn.PM: We have one fully complete map. It's big, it's a good scale. You can explore and go on for a while. If you're just looking for the teleporter, you can do that, but in 3D you can make the environment so much grander that it doesn't exactly need these permutations. If it starts to feel stale, we can add permutations. We have some ideas for that, we just aren't sure it's 100 percent necessary.One of the biggest hurdles with Risk of Rain was the multiplayer. You've said you're making improvements there, including Steam peer-to-peer.DD: We have it where you hit this matchmaking button and it will match you with four people. You can do private games as well. We don't know exactly how much more we're going to expand because this is new territory for us. We do have reconnecting working, but maybe there's some weird conflict down the line. The only feature I can say for sure is going to be there is Steam peer-to-peer.PM: You don't have to port forward. Anyone can be a host now. Risk of Rain definitely didn't make it easy to get online with your friends. Being a small team in college of two people, we wanted the online portion to be there, but it was the best we could technically do at that point. Now we've got more knowledge of the idea, what we want, what people want. This is one of the features we really want to focus on with this one. Hit play and join with people, hit play and join your friends. Super simple and streamlined. We also have the private games where you can invite friends from your Steam friends list. And these are all working internally, but…DD: [laughs] We also have split-screen working online as well, so you can have two people on one PC quickplay to another person on another PC. We have to make sure there's no issues with that, like two people on split-screen join three people on split-screen and now you're at five out of four in a match. Internally it works. We want to keep split-screen because we know a lot of players liked the couch co-op. Getting the multiplayer to \"one button and you can play with your friend\" was our focus from the beginning, before even moving to 3D.PM: It was the number-one thing we can fix.DD: Yeah, we had to improve the multiplayer if we were going to make a sequel.Are artifacts returning?DD: We're planning on launching with artifacts. Artifacts became a lot more important to the community than we expected. We always considered them as fun options. Once you've played the game a lot, you can extend the lifetime. But a lot of people used them as the only way they play Risk of Rain. So we're keeping the concept of artifacts and bringing that back.A lot of the storytelling in Risk of Rain was hidden in item and monster logs. Are we going to see that same writing style again?DD: We have a better idea of the story that's going to be present throughout the game, but I'd still say it's not a narrative-driven game. We'll definitely still do the item log, monster log thing. I want another outlet of presenting more of a direct reference to what's going on the world. We talked about character logs for the characters you play.PM: That's kind of what we did with the first one. We wanted to focus on gameplay, then if you cared about the story, you could read through the logs. We want that same experience. We don't want to interrupt your run with a cutscene where you're smashing space like \"get this out of here.\" That's how we like to build games.DD: Gameplay first.You said you hope to launch in 2018. Does that still look feasible?DD: I have no idea, to be honest.PM: We hope we do! It's just…DD: We've never made a 3D game.PM: It's a much bigger, fleshed out game. Risk of Rain was pretty barebones. It was very fun, but it wasn't as fleshed out as we would have liked. With this one, we want to make sure we've got language support, controller support, everything that makes a proper game. 2018 would be awesome. We don't know what we're going to do with testing or beta, but something in 2018. Maybe not the final release, but something.Subscribe to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

      "Every \"run\" in Risk of Rain starts out the same, with no way to save progress partway.  The character is level 1 with no gold or items and has to obtain such during the playthrough.  The run will continue until the player dies, quits, or wins the final level, at which point achievements/unlocks are saved and all experience, gold, and items are discarded.  The player must balance item collection and level progress against the clock, as the difficulty increases with time.  See Strategies for suggestions of going about this with the most likely chances of survival.  Progressing through levels or activating teleporters too quickly can lead to underleveled/undergeared characters dying quickly, requiring more skill but sometimes resulting in simply being overrun.  The random spawns and items add some spice, forcing players to be flexible in their playstyles.Each map contains a Teleporter which must be found and then activated.  A countdown timer will start and the spawn rate will increase, including at least one boss.  The timer is 90 seconds on Drizzle and Rainstorm, and 120 seconds on Monsoon.  When the countdown is complete, enemies will stop spawning.  When no enemies are left, the teleporter can be activated to move to the next level, or the player can scour the map for any leftover item crates or shrines.  Items and experience will be retained, and any leftover gold will be converted to XP points.There is no \"end\" to Risk of Rain other than finishing a run by defeating the final boss.  The game's replayability is enhanced by the fact that every run will typically unlock new items (increasing chances to survive next time), artifacts (to mutate the game's rules in many ways), or new characters to master.  \"Beating\" it could possibly be described as achieving 100% of all unlocks."

      "If you are a fan of challenging puzzles, robots, rogue-like stealth games, and eating … furniture, Not the Robots is just the game for you! I recently stumbled upon this little gem, developed by 2DArray and published by TinyBuild, while perusing about Steam and the goodies it had to offer on sale. Seeing the first image on the store page, I was intrigued. What would I, a robot, be doing in what looks like an office that is made to look like an office, but actually just houses things for an office. Each level is procedurally generated so you will not play the same level twice. Ever. With a Very Positive rating on Steam, combined with the fact that it was on sale, I decided to pick it up. Even though the few hours I have put into it have been increasingly tough, I have no regrets!In what was regarded as 2013’s Most Exciting Roguelike Stealth Furniture Eating Simulator, Not the Robots has you play as a robot who has to do exactly that; eat the furniture. You traverse offices, and the buildings in which they are contained, attempting to eat all of the furniture. However, that furniture that you’re eating? It is also your cover from the oscillating lasers of doom and the sentries of destruction! The more you play and the more you eat, the harder each level becomes. The lasers come in two varieties: an orange-ish laser that is about head level and can easily be ducked under, and a blue laser that is knee level that you better find cover or it will hurt. Really hurt. Double red lasers? There’s no escape.If C-3PO had a skull under that shiny, golden dome of his, I imagine it would look something like this. This is a sentry. It is a floating head that turns into a bringer of death upon noticing you. I believe this goes without saying….avoid these things at all costs. They are the ruiner of days. They will leave you alone after noticing you, but they will stay alert and continue to look for you. When you begin a level with sentries, you will notice that they kind of stick to a predetermined path, but it isn’t actually predetermined due to each level being procedurally generated. They will make a couple passes along the same route, and then change paths. It does not appear that they can detect you by sound, but only by a line of sight that is rather narrow. I’ve been able to slip past alongside them without detection. Either way, if they spot you, you better run, hide, rethink your decisions up until that point, and try to be even more stealthy.Luckily, to aid you along in your quest to become the best damn furniture eater this side of the galaxy, various power-ups are scattered throughout the levels. Some of these include the ability to dig through walls, invisibility, sprinting, teleporting, health, and an extra life. The extra life definitely comes in handy because when you die, that’s it. Game over. While you may have to start from the beginning, your character continues to advance by gaining XP from eating the furniture. Leveling up unlocks perks such as better power-ups, missions, and challenges outside of the main campaign, and the ability to change the difficulty setting of the main campaign. Craziness ensues.The way this game plays out is a real treat. I prefer games that you have to put serious thought into. Games that you have to take your time to ensure that you win. Not the Robots is a game that “run & gun” will not work. I’ve tried. Sure, you may be able to complete a level and return to your tube, but I promise you will not have much health left, and that low level of health carries on to the next level. I should also mention that there are bonuses for completing a level without being harmed, and for eating everything. You don’t have to eat everything to complete the level; you just have to fill your Food meter. But where’s the fun in that? Did I also mention that there are tiles made of lava? There are tiles made of lava. And there are moving walls of lasers. And there are giant hovering numbers that you must pass through in the specified sequence to finish a level. Sometimes, all of these things coexist in the same level. This game is tough. Fun, but tough. And that’s the way it should be.If I were to give this game a score in any way, as it stands, it would be damn near perfect. Now, I haven’t completed the game yet, but I refuse to give something a bad score just because it is difficult. The graphics are pleasing to look at, the mechanics of the game are smooth and everything seems to play out as naturally as a robot eating/absorbing furniture while dodging lasers and gunfire is to be expected. Plus, the soundtrack is rather fitting for such a game. My only hang up, and again, I haven’t played much, is that the story seems to be taking a backseat to the game itself. I’m hopeful that that changes with the more I play.If you’re into rogue-like stealth puzzle games, I highly recommend that you check out Not the Robots.

In this game, every time you play a level, it is created from scratch. You are never allowed to try a given level more than one time.The game is intended to be enjoyed in relatively short sittings, over a long overall period. Not the Robots may seem simple at first, but it's full of mysteries to solve, secrets to find, and tricks to learn.

      "by WR_Tofsla - 9.02.2018This time we went for a slightly different format: instead of chaotically going from topic to topic, we picked and answered 5 top questions from last two weeks discussions.Let's go!Q: New modes keep coming and it becomes harder and harder to get the mode I want to play right now. This is deeply troubling for me — should I be ready for worse?New modes are incredibly helpful as a tool for opening more unexpected facets to the game. We want to open the mind and find what else is possible in War Robots other than just running around knee-deep in blood, oil and spare parts (even though this is kinda the point). Make it so the game is always in a flux — but a healthy one. You should come into the game expecting something new and cool to see experiencing delight and curiosity — not the existential horror of “oh gosh, what do I have to grind for now“ kind.By the way, we are extremely happy with the feedback on King of the Hill you gave us. Currently, KotH steadily holds 20-30% of all concurrent matches with those preferring speed over power and seems like we struck the vein for a particular style of players. And at the same time threads like this one allowed us to locate the issues that we’ll do our best to avoid in the future. Thank you!Of course, with new modes come certain drawbacks — playerbase segregation is possibly the biggest culprit. We already have many players who enjoy playing exclusively TDM. Or sticking to the roots with Domination. Adding separate matchmaking queues is not the option here as it will hurt the matchmaking times and quality by a large margin.But we also understand that you don’t want to be left at the mercy of random when it comes to picking modes. To soften the impact, we increased Domination and TDM reward multiplier (+10% and +33% respectively) earlier this week. Now you should get about the same amount of silver per match as you would in Beacon Rush.In the meantime, we took a step back to check our priorities and see if we’re going in a right direction in how we handle new modes. There are many strategies we could adopt. Should we leave one queue for a fixed mode and rotate modes in the second queue? Or reshuffle queues and make it so, say, we have Domination+TDM and BR+KotH queues?We’ll see soon.Q: When will Workshop 2.0 go live?It is still pretty far away — a couple of months away at the very least. But once there's something new to unveil, we won't make you wait any longer!Q: The way it looks the only components in supply drops will be Kumiho components? Is this the case?The goal is to switch Supply Drop contents every month or so. We'll begin with Kumiho, then rotating to something else — and so on.We also plan to launch a poll where people will be able to vote for things they want to see in the next Supply Drop season. Stay tuned.Q: In 3.6 you introduced a new pop up message about repercussions of leaving the match too early. Is it really enough to stop people from abusive activity like tanking?No. Definitely not.What we're actually doing with this popup is getting rid of the current \"it's alright to leave, so just go\" message that was there for eternity. Leaving a match is still okay in many cases, but the idea we want to plant is that there’s always a chance to ruin the game for your teammates if you leave them too early. Which is, of course, not alright.This message alone is not going to stop hardcore tankers — would be naive to expect that to happen after the change so tiny. But the part of the issue comes from the fact that some people believe we support tanking — and we don't. We want to establish that clearly enough with proper wordings on our side.There a lot of discussion going on which approach we should pick to handle matchmaking exploits.For now, you can use this form to report players ruining your experience.Q: Shocktrain is dominating in high leagues. Any plans on nerfing it?We aren’t going to leave Shocktrain as it is, that’s for sure. We don’t want to nerf it into oblivion, as this would alienate thousands of people who enjoy using it (there's always two sides to the coin). But our goal is definitely to emphasize counterplay, allowing you to find weak spots in Shocktrain-packed enemies’ defence. This weapon should remain relevant — but not nearly as dominant as it is right now.By the way, Shocktrain is not the only piece of equipment we’re looking at. We also want to bring many outclassed pieces — like Wild Bunch robots — to the forefront with some precise buffs.We already have some solutions ready. As always, they will surface on the test server first — follow its official page and be ready for the upcoming week's announcements!Sign in to commentSheban, \"Wallet warrior\", haha thats funny. If you spend $100s on sw robots, then there is only one way to describe you: idiot. Just the kind pixonic loves. who cares if you win battles, anyone who spends 100s on the game is just plain retarted loser to me. If the robots were anywhere even half the price i would pay. And any of the bright minds over here talk about \"oh they have to run a business\" then you are even more stupid. yes making profit is one thing and pixonic have a right to do so but greed is something else and i for one is not going to be made a fool out of by a greedy game company that makes and sells digital robots for idiots around to buyAlot of people that do like koth know how to win the game there are players in expert still flailing around just trying to kill everyone like he is going to win the game  ....if he gets enough kills ....lol i personally like koth i move up the ranks so fast due to alot of peoples flailing....Zero Jee, You're right. Pixonic isn't stupid or unaware. It's their hypocrisy that pisses off a lot of people. It's their lip service about fair play, tankers reporting form and their act against tanking that make me sick because they never do anything concrete to solve the problem. I personally don't mind paying. I still spend moderate amount of money to this day. If there's a good deal, why not? This game is a business after all and without paying customer, it wont't be available for us to play. So, yeah you're right. Tanking and sealclubbing is just a symptom, not the real problem. Yet again, it's their hypocrisy that pisses me off. They act like they're concerned but they couldn't care less because they do absolutely nothing to solve the problem.So, everyones talking about tankers being the problem, and some rep is here blowing smoke up our asses ahout making it stop. LMAO. What a friggin joke!People who tank aren't the problem. It is the manipulative matchmaking system which is designed to make you want to spend money to compete.  All Pigsonic needs to do is match players based on gear and hangars, rather that player level.  I started a new account yesterday and am already at level 19.  I have been encountering playerswith end game stuff in Bronze III . . . What a joke!They rigged the progression system so you move up quickly, but obtaining weapons to compete at that level takes a lot longer.  So you are being matched against people with premium gear when you only have a basic silver hangar.  What is Pigsponics fix? Add a respawn timer.  LOL.  I was tanking too, but not so I could go seal clubbing noobs for gold, but just to be able to stay in the league that I could compete in and have a decent match.  But that is not even viable any more, there are folks seal clubbing in leagues as low as Private league, before Bronze!Pigsonic is not stupid, or unaware. Everything is very calclated in order to get an emotional response out of you (Jealousy, rage, etc. . .) and pushes you towards paying to be competetive. The progression system should match the gear, and the gear should be assigned values that relegates it to certain leages.  For instance, players using AU/WP bots and weopons should not be able to play in Bronze.  Players with more that 3 slots or multople hangars should also be shut out of Bronze.  In addition players should not be reaching level 20+ within 20 hours of game play and unlocking (but far from being able to purchase) end game content.  The progression should match what you can currently use, and the match making algorithm should be matching players at the same level of play, and also similar gear and hangar slots.If Pigsonic actually gave a dooky about it's player base this thread wouldn't exist.  All of us f2p whiners are irrelevant, as long as some idiot is willing to pay hundreds of dollars for pixels.So, everyones talking about tankers being the problem, and some rep is here blowing smoke up our asses ahout making it stop.

All of us f2p whiners are irrelevant, as long as some idiot is willing to pay hundreds of dollars for pixels.Pilot FM9CUY, It's been two months since the last time we communicated through this forum. Now 3.8 is up and I really like FFA, as so many of my clan mates. During that time, I met many-many tankers and I have only reported few of them. I thought reporting is just a waste of time. At first I reported them because it eased my frustration, a little bit, now, not anymore. I never knew what became of my reports, truth is: I think my reports are sent directly to garbage bin because in the battlefield I still meet a lot of tankers. I don't even think LPQ does exist anymore. Battle reward is cool and I appreciate it but tankers are still rampant.What makes me write this note to you is, what else? I've been repeatedly abused by tankers in the battlefield, all golds stolen, I've got minus points and my league has been going up and down like a yo-yo. You know it just made me think. Look back at what you wrote to me in this forum, Man. None of what you wrote ever happened in the field. The developing team doesn't have any will to do a real action against tankers. Tanking is still profitable, Man, it gets you golds, a currency you can convert to many valuable things. Who cares about battle rewards when you have chests of golds to spend in discount deals everyday? Free for All, Domination, King of the Hill? It doesn't matter. Tankers prevail, and they don't spend money, Bro, they don't have to. They have all the golds. In the opposite side, I've been spending considerable amount of money to the game and what do I get?So, this note is not a feedback. I'm just expressing my dissapointment to Pixonic and to you. Please, take a moment to look back and read your comments to my notes. Does any of what you have written come into realization in the game? No, right? Maybe that's exactly the reason why tankers are still around to this very day.Sheban, This is what so many players have been telling Pix for so long and they never listen. It's good that people like you (and me too) spend some money on the game. It makes the business running and available for us to enjoy. If you buy golds to speed up the upgrades and your overall hangar weight becomes considerably higher than your current league, that in itself is not fair for some battles ahead. If some lower level players reported you for being overpowered, you can't really blame because that's the fact they faced in the battlefield. However, I think your winning will eventually set your league to an appropriate level, so however bad your current situation is, it should be temporary.I still don't understand why Pix wouldn't deal with the root of the tanking epidemic. Tanking involves a set of repeated behaviors. Going up and down the leagues, if shown as a chart in the statistics, will show a sinusoidal. It should be easy to detect. If you buy a huge amount of golds and speed up your upgrades, your statistics will look different. You'll go up the league, not down with deliberate poor performance. After 3.7 updates, with Battle Rewards which supposed to encourage players to go up instead of down the league, tanking is still rampant in the game. I'm only at Silver III, my total victories is less than 300, my robots and weapons are ranging from level 1-9, yet I faced opponents at the same league but their hangar is packed with maxed out dash bots and MkII weapons. How do I know that they are tankers, not paying customer like you? They have huge value in victories, sometimes they have winged trophies.Tanking was and is still profitable. You farm golds by obliterating low level players and in this game you can convert golds into so many good and practical things. Battle Rewards is a good idea, I like it, but it doesn't make tanking decreases, let alone vanishes. You can get considerable amount of golds by tanking, you don't need to pay anything. Those tankers, they're not coward, they're greedy. I'm in a clan which opposes tanking and we fight in squad to increase our chance of winning.Wow! “tankers reporting form”, SERIOUSLY??? This is really DAFT decision ever!Every crying noob baby will be reporting and complaining about every single player *facepalm* who deems that opponents hanghar is far too OP.Its like complaining to mum about being abused by elder brother.I ended up today in LPQ without any apparent reason.Again, I was buying quite a lot of gold in order to speed up my upgrades, now, am I guilty and must be reported for having better gear than others?I have been grinding day and night through all events to get my Kumiho, Bulgasari, Haechi and Shocktrains and spent money on gold to speed up upgrade process.Seriously, you people who dont grind nor invest real $$ expect to win with the old school Bots and Spirals against dash bots? Then cry and report when got killed? I am speechless *facepalm* game got ruined even farther.There is no such thing as “fair” play today, some people play with what they have got, while others “wallet warriors” pay for preimum stuff.I cannot call myself a “wallet warrior” but I do spend some money to speed up upgrades, as it takes ages and ages of waiting.Another thing is that amount of rewarded silver after a battle, even with the “premium” is far too small, must be increased. This is one of the reasons why people tank.Makes sense?When will the winners will be announced  war robot's please answer i can't wait😭 you make us suffer hope i will be people who got that robot inquisitorPilot FM9CUY, That would be great. I’m a newer player, started in January and am level 29. As a new player there is a difference between a new 29/30 player and a seasoned one. But I have been in some battles recently with Expert, Diamond and League winners and it’s obvious they have tanked down. One guy had a 5 hanger deck and on each deck he had maxed out Bots level MK2 with Mk2 weapons and yet he was in silver league 3. He killed my whole team so fast, the whole battle lasted one minute. This is just one instance, everyday I see tankers, I just finished a beacon rush battle with a tanker. He got over a million damage points while the rest of his team and mine did max damage around 300-400 k. It would be fantastic if there was some way to tell who these players are during the battle and not find out after the battle. Maybe make them glow poop brown or toxic green so we can see them across the battlefield lol.Dominate high league? Do you guys forget it ruins low leagues when pay to win players run there with mkII shocks and destroy everyone one hit? Thats supposed to be fun? Also, these people wouldnt even be allowed go into leagues like diamond. And thanks this, are weapons like thunders dying. Because camping=win (tulumbas, shocktrain,..)Pilot FM9CUY, That'll be great! :) Actually, after fighting so many tankers, you could identify one almost immediately and be extra careful from the beginning. Players with adequate experience will develop that sense and in some cases, players work together on attacking the tankers. I was just wondering that with an in-battle marking, collective attack would be more immediate and coordinated. I think it would result in a more challenging conditions for tankers to dominate the game play, thus giving the rest of the player a bit sense of fairness.Pilot FM9CUY, You may need to have a little chat with the guys who did the animation on the ‘Whats next for War Robots’ Mercury video. I’m no expert, I mean of course being a poor man such as  myself I do not actually own the robot but I’m pretty sure that the Inquisitor does indeed feture a heavy slot somewhere in it’s arsenal.GarciaMarquez, Yes, about that. Last I saw the devs were actually working on a \"mark\" feature for tankers. The mark was like a running man to signify their dishonourable behaviour of running from battle and deserting allies. It'll even show up on their profiles and scorecards after battle.So, this is just an idea.Update 3.7 is up with the Battle Rewards and all, though it hasn't active yet. I understand that it will encourage people to play their best and going up the ladder instead of down. However, I still think that tanking is still profitable. If you're a Gold player tanker, playing against Bronzes is easy. You'll be on top of the winning team and reap 10 golds, lots of silvers from high damage, etc. Winning 10 golds is a lot. If you play 20 games a day and win, and finish daily tasks too, you'll have lots of golds in short amount of time.In battle, you know what it's like to face a way higher level of tanking opponent. You don't stand a chance! So my idea is: mark the tankers. If Pixonic makes a set of algorithm to identify them, I think it should be visible in the gameplay (e.g., a different color for the tankers' name). Seriously, you'd need a whole team of normal player to kill the tankers. I think we should make things a bit difficult for them and add a little bit of fair play to the game. Pixonic doesn't have to punish them, we–the players–will get them. And marking will also attract tankers in both teams so you'll see tankers in one team will immediately focus on the tankers in the opposing team instead of preying on weaker player.So, why don't you make the rule, Pixonic? Define: what is tanking? What set of behaviors could be consider tanking? Then, mark them tankers. You don't even need to punish them, let the marking changes the dynamics of the game. Battle Rewards is cool but tanking is still profitable. The day to day reality in War Robots is, if you play fairly and honestly, it's hard, full of stress, almost zero fun,  you get nothing. You endlessly complaining to Pixonic and reporting without knowing the result of your contribution. In contrast, tanking is easy, free of stress, fun and profitable. Players can play free and in a month get enough golds to sophisticate their hangar. This could result in damaging the business because they don't buy anything and they ruin the gameplay. So, my idea: MARK THE TANKERS. Let us do the dirty job of dealing with them, altogether.Pilot FM9CUY, I was referring to robots (and weapons) actually. Previously everyone had access to silver bots, they were the mainstay and backbone of any hanger and in many cases still are. Workshop bots were the highest tier, the robots that were, by function made to be superior than the silver bots as a natural progression to keep the game interesting with gold bots acting as a kind of optional extra. Like if you wanted more speed early on the Gepard was a very powerful choice but as you level up it is eventually eclipsed by the Stalker. If you needed a lot of firepower you bought the Fury though it didn't do anything else (it was very purpose built). Gold itself is also acquired very slowly so have to be careful about how you use it. With the introduction of the Knights of Camelot and Wild Bunch gold has been given kind of it's own tier. At the moment almost all of the new bots added have been medium class and they just absolutely dominate anything else though if more light and heavy bots were to be added they would all become tier 4 the \"Stealth/Dash tier\"  as it were.Lecygne, Hello!So sorry to keep you waiting. Well, as it turns out apparently your ticket was closed because they can't help you. Which means I probably can't as well. But, I'll see if I can do something. Since its the weekend, and people are busy with the new update and all, it might take a while though.Apologies again.LoucustMaster117, Higher tiers as in?Personally, I'm happy with Supply Drops. I got  a free Kumiho, on my way to a second one from it just for opening the app 2 times a day.Pilot FM9CUY, Hey, there`s nothing wrong with making higher tiers but having them so inaccessible to both new and old free to play gamers? Just saying. You know I wouldn't mind it so much if only I could consistently get the right components (3016 Bulgasari and counting) plus you and I both know that the supply drops are a joke 1 vote in 10,000,000 doesn't count for jack. (Here's to hoping that the new and \"improved\" workshop takes care of that).Pilot FM9CUY, Hello FM9CUY, I'm coming back to you because I do not know if my request to get a little something about my viewing problem of the advertising video has been accepted or not. My technical problem is referenced under error code 17937 at Pixonic. This problem has been resolved by technical support. I'm sorry to use you as a messenger. You are my only human contact with Pixonic. My email address is infosgame1@gmail.com Thank you for your help. Lecygne ID Player: RSWFWQ Nickname: Lecygne25LoucustMaster117, Yes indeed, it does make seem the bots that do not have Dash, dash.GarciaMarquez, Yes, we are definitely looking at some of those parametres to differentiate tankers.

Just in case this information would be of any help, tankers would have:- high amount of victories (3K+)- high amount of max damage (1M+)- high amount of max destroyed (10+)- five high level robots- high level weapons- sometimes more than one hangar- low trophies- low league (Bronze+)Yes, KOTH was excellent mode at the beginning. Now it is frustrating. Most of players just sit in base beacons and run between them and don`t give a s**t for team victory and don`t want to help you. They just let you solo fight reds and die. Of course that is the way how you lose match and plenty rank points mostly 11, 17 and 22. But when we win  because I fought reds for central beacon I collect 3, 4 and sometimes 10 rank points and in next match I lose 22. Stupid rank point system. Need to introduce honor rewards, report system so we can report selfish players so they can get less points and their points to be given to other players. Also in game chat need to be introduced so we can coordinate attacks. That is the reason I quit KOTH mode.GarciaMarquez, Well, it takes a lot of time to process tanker reports because honestly, people have been very ingenious in their methods. Therefore, it has to be judged very carefully unlike hacks and cheats which are easier to detect and can be automated.I'll see what can be done about the tanker in question.GarciaMarquez, Well, it takes a lot of time to process tanker reports because honestly, people have been very ingenious in their methods. Therefore, it has to be judged very carefully unlike hacks and cheats which are easier to detect and can be automated.I'll see what can be done about the tanker in question.Maybe you should make a video on \"The art of tanking\" when a Diamond 2 pilot hangs up 1.8 million, more than 5 blue diamond 2 pilots put together, you've got a problem.Pilot FM9CUY, I have a situation like this: I have met this Player ID: W17IF1 more than once. I reported him more than once. We fought in normal league. He has 7000+ victories, his hangar consist of maxed out robots and weapon (Lancelot, Bulgasari, Haechi, Kumiho, plus new and dangerous weapons), but he's only at Bronze I. In the other hand, I'm a new player. I only have 109 victories. I only have 4 robots and weapons at level 5-6. I'm at Silver II.Playing honestly is not appreciated in War Robots. Paying a lot of money does, because you can be a tanker if you want. My question is: why he is still fighting in normal league? Has he been sent to LPQ? How do I know that my report has been processed? Why do I met this player again? He's a damn tanker and I've reported him! Three times! :(I think you change  Shocktrain like this!change ranges from 500m to 600mand only damage the robot you target.Everything else should be what it is.Slash-1966,  по-моему разработчики ни хрена не думают Я тоже перестал практически играть в то время когда Смешали режимы потомучто Невозможно играть ты получаешь задание по захвате Маяков Нажимаешь кнопку игры и у тебя режим Смертельная битва Каким образом я могу в смертельной битве выполнить задание по маякам Да и вообще игра стало просто фу я захожу в игру только чтобы забрать призы и любимая игра превратилась просто так ещё одну игру но Надежда не умирает пока я жду что разработчики всё-таки додумаются сделать раздельные режимы как было Если же этого не случится я уже подыскала альтернативу и я покину эту игруGarciaMarquez, Yeah, from what I can tell you, they are developing some anti-tanking measures that take into account all the behaviour associated with the act so far.Yes, the reporting form is real and people do look through it!Valid complaints! you people at PIX pay close attention because I'm leading up to a point. I'm 51 years old and I was gaming before any of you were even born starting with Pong in 1972. I've been playing WR for 3 years and I know I have a clean record with 5194 victories I never paid money to get - and that's on my 3rd account alone.1: With the Nov 17th 3.4 update came nothing but freezing and crashes on my Android. It got even worse with the Lunar New Year update. It was to a point that the game was unplayable. I couldn't into matches anymore and when I did they crashed. After following the Pix advice on how to cure the problem yesterday I did a full reset on my phone and did a clean install of WR. It still crashes and freezes! A mid game crash or freeze counts as leaving or tanking. 2: When I moved in January I had a very bad connection where I live and I lost connection dozens of times. Many matches had to be abandoned. This counts as leaving or tanking.3: Tasks vs game modes. If we get tasks to capture beacons then we get dumped in TDM all day and leave before the match even starts THIS TOO counts as leaving or tanking! 4: Why the hell did you create a Deathmatch mode when the game is already Deathmatch!? The original mode called \"Dominance\" now is deathmatch! TDM- Nobody likes it and players eject on both both sides at the start. I've seen whole teams leave all but 1 player left on the team. Even dumber yet leaving counts as a kill for the opposing team. Clearly no one likes it! Least of all me because it doesn't lead to tasks being completed. So I leave before the match starts and this counts as leaving or tanking?5: A couple of days ago I suspected I was in the LQ. I couldn't get matches anymore. I go for the remedy of creating squads. The 1st one is with a clan mate. Everything goes well until I hit To Battle. The game freezes!! Another tank or leave, right!? I reboot my phone and send a message to my clan mate apologizing for the problem. I finally got into a couple of matches yesterday. In one we had a victory. I was the best in the match. No gold, no silver, no keys. Reward? -- just over 2500 silver. WTH?? And no one else got rewards that I could see. What's the point of playing for battle rewards if that's all you get?When do I actually leave? It's rare but I do it. When my idiotic Bronze League team mates have allowed us to be overrun within 20 seconds of start is a good time to leave. Why the hell are they even in Diamond matches? Why add a loser to my record for playing my best? Does this make sense? Not from a player perspective. Several days ago my victory rate was hovering around 70%. Today it's at 36% for being the best loser? STUPID, and a good reason to leave! So today while typing this out I waited over 22 minutes for a match that didn't come. Then I get a invite to a squad. To Battle--No players can be found in over 2 minutes? Leadership is xferd to me. Do it again. Cancel. Do it again. Nothing - no players found. Cancel. I review who is online in my lists. No one! Why?HERE is your problem. No one wants to play anymore because of the pay-to-win players and their super bots. AND no one wants to play anymore because of random mode. I've already asked a few people about this - not to mention what people say on your Facebook page. I want to play but can't because of your screwed LQ and tanker penalties which aren't getting any tankers or league droppers. It gets people with buggy glitchy updates, crashing games, freezes, and bad connections. Meanwhile the tankers are free to play on. I'm seeing fewer and fewer players in matches these days. No more 6v6, more like 4-5, 5-6, 3-5 etc THIS SHOULD BE A HINT TO YOU. People aren't playing anymore.BUSINESS? GUESS WHAT? You're seeing short term profits and it all looks good, right? But if the players with their pay-to-win MK2 super bots have no one left to shoot because of your screwed up system?--You'll be out of business soon. Trust me, I know. I own a business too and I've learned some lessons about doing things a little \"too good\". I do the jobs so well that they don't call back for years - they don't have to. So I had to change how I did things. You might want try the Henry Ford approach on your business model \"cars for the masses\". A few days ago I was going to use my credit card and finish the job of getting what's left on a Kumbo. I was sent to LQ instead. So now that can't play I can just sit and wait for a free Kumbo via the Supply Line drops9among other things. I'm a few days away from a free Kumbo now (let that sink in). Again, you missed the money. RECOMMENDATION? It was the leagues that started the problem of tanking, and it was the random mode and update bugs that caused leaving. You might want to get rid of leagues and go for individual ranking like most other game devs do. Get rid of random modes and let players select what they want instead. and DEFINITELY get rid of themes. All the rewards tasks, puzzles, chests, drops... It has us doing everything but playing matches - which is the point of the game. I'm playing Robokrieg now because I can't play WR anymore. I'm seeing all the classic ranking structure and it's still the best way to do it. Since the game is relatively new and the devs are asking for player feedback I could easily see this game being very damaging to your profit margin. The WR copycat devs and apps are popping up all over Google Play. Why did that happen? What are taking advantage of? Pix losing players by the thousands. In my own clan only 10 of 26 play now. Why? Let be anecdotal for a minute. Early in my clan we had a pay-to-win player. Boy did he spend some money! He quit the day the leagues were released.You folks have some thinking to do.Good daySlash-1966Pilot FM9CUY, Okay, sorry for my harsh comment, I was frustrated. My point still stand, though. In my opinion, tanking would create a specific pattern which could be detected by looking at the statistics. In league ranking, e.g., the line would look sinusoidal because they go way down and way up. In battle damage, it would go very low for so many battles and then go up drastically. I don’t believe Pixonic doesn't know this. They sure do. Question is: why Pixonic doesn't take a deliberate action in stopping the tankers once and for all by algorithm in the first place?Spending money for in app purchase is good. I personally hope Pixonic makes good business, but why tanking? If you have heavyweight hangar, play at your league, why bully new players? You know, I tried to tank my league down myself couple of times, but it's boring and quite stupid. Repeatedly destroying your robots and suicide with you last one is boring because you have to go a long way down. Even if you do that, it doesn't guarantee you a -22, sometimes your team wins and you get +3 instead. So I don’t understand how some tankers could go so low down to Bronze 3? And some of them have got winged trophies! What a patience! I don’t have that much patience so tanking doesn't interest me but playing honestly is painful because of them tankers.So I was thinking, why Pixonic always try to deal with the symptoms instead of taking care the root problem?Ok, enough of my rants. One more question. Tankers reporting form is real, yes? I hope it is. I reported a lot of tankers. Today I met *four* tankers, two in my team, two in opponent's. I had to screen-capture each of them and write down their ID manually, one by one, instead of just copying one ID. It's epidemic, it's the cancer of the game. I'm looking forward to seeing Battle Rewards takes effect. And I'm still hoping all the tankers could be fed to the Lions up there. Thank you for listening. :)Pilot FM9CUY, Hello FM9CUY, I thank you for your help because I was not sure that my message sent last week come to his destination. Here is my ID ID Player: RSWFWQ Nickname: Lecygne25 Best RegardsLecygne, Bonjour LeCygne!Cava?Yes, we will introduce measures and ways to regulate such unruly players and hopefully stop unfair plays.I'll send your request to the concerned people, but I need your ID first.Pilot FM9CUY, Hello FM9CUY, I thank you for taking the time to answer my messages. Frankly it would be great if Pixonic would manage to regulate the behavior of some players. I think that many players share this opinion in order to have a fair competition (Fairplay). Indeed I saw many comments (post) on the Forum of \"War Robots\". After some players pay to have the latest robot or weapon, does not shock me. On the contrary these players help Pixonic company to develop by trading new products and new version of the game.  A little word to the developer team, I say \"A big bravo and keep on going to give us pleasure\" Lecygne (Swan) - France P.S: I reported Technical Support the error code 17937 \"The Advertising video is not display\". The Solution n°2 has been posted in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). I sent a thanks message through my Cell and I asked if it would be possible to get a little something for the 3 weeks where I could not open the free bronze chests. Could you suggest it look at my request? Thank you.Lecygne, I can understand your concerns. As of now, I can assure you that the Supply Drops are going to get more tweaked in 3.7 and 3.8, and Battle Rewards will come which are designed as some anti-tanker measures. As for repeat offenders...we are keeping a naughty list, and a repeat offender score :) They'll get harsher and harsher sentences each time.The algorithm we have now has a few problems. For example, we look for a cheat some player's use called \"lag switch\" that deliberately introduces lag to help the player. However, the effect of lag switch is very similar to a poor internet connection. So, sometimes we need to be extra careful. But, from what I hear a much better algorithm is in the process of being made!Pilot FM9CUY, Hello FM9CUY, I use the new form to report the players who seem to me to be campers by looking at their player profile (total Victories in relation to their rank in the League, the level of their robots and armaments, their average damage compared / related the number maximum). I take a screenshot including both the Table of ranking and the Player profile. Once in the Low Priority Queue (LPQ), the player will not receive Gold (Au), keys, he will have less Silvers and he will not lose his rank / status in the ranking, will not it. After a certain number of rounds playing correctly and properly, the player will come out of this League Low Priority (LPQ). He's going to buy a good behavior. After what guarantees do we have that he will not do it again and start again his bad behavior. In the world of sport, we have a referee who intervenes to regulate and punish the bad behaviors of the players. So the question I ask myself is why Pixonix does not set up an algorithm to detect the bad behaviors and why it rests only on players to denounce the bad behaviors through the new online form. After I guess the new form is processed by a robot because you do not have the human time to process all the complaints.GarciaMarquez, Your comment had to be deleted since it violated policies in place. Rest assured, it wasn't due to criticism; a lot of harsh criticism is still left on this page, undeleted. It was because of the language it was delivered in. Please provide another reasoned, civil feedback without personal attacks on staff and groups of staff and I'll pass it on.Your accountants don't like my comment, huh, Pixonic? They want it deleted. :DDave Dave Crook, Matchmaking will not fix tanking. There are so many reasons out there and to fix all of them is nearly impossible. Some like to farm gold, not because of matchmaking. Others are sick of dash bots and tank to fight weaker robots. Then there is a handful who tank to try to win the grand prize in events.Papajofixit, Finally someone noticed!!!d1mk1n, Yes that is very much required.  I can't even play a game without being shot down immediately by mk II weap9ns and robotsMK3, Too late mate, they are super common now You were correct there us no more fun 😢😭Lecygne, I am  sure because I am a mod and know about its existence. I have seen lots of people being sent there.Well, we need to read and process each complaint about tankers so that we aren't reacting to some revenge-report, or some mis-attribution, so that's why it takes time. In a while, such behaviour will be severely punished and the lower leagues scoured clean hopefully.You can always report such clans and players here:  https://goo.gl/forms/r7mFMHzxOV9lSdMI3Dave Dave Crook, To quote John Brown, sort of, \"Pixonic is all talk; what we need is action - action!\"One problem that I don't share is the waiting. Maybe I'm just in a good time zone.I don't like the random mode though. I hate KOTH and TDM. I think the originals are the best- BR and Domination.Pilot FM9CUY, Hello FM9CUY,Thank you for your answer. Why are you sure Purgatory exists?In each round, there is always one or two Tankers / Campers in the lower league.If Pixonic had taken this problem seriously, long time these players will have calmed down.It's just a game, nobody wins real money. On the contrary, we spend it.I saw messages where the clan leader encouraged their members to be downgraded to win more medals (activity points of the week).I do not understand this behavior. What honor is there to be ranked in the top 100 with this type of behavior?Making shocktrain more accessable to more people won't help. If everyone has shocktrains, they'll just destroy each other at 500 m. There goes all the fun of the game.Naval Shank, Thank you.ETC ROBLES, And when the reds come at you, you rip them apart with the shocktrains. This weapon needs a nerf.Lecygne, No, no we read it. Takes a bit of time to process and judge all the complaints but eventually the nasty tankers are sent deep into LPQ purgatory!The Tankers / Campers are a plague, a parasite for honest players who want to progress. I hope that with the new denunciation’s form, the information will be processed. My fear is that the email address where the form will be sent would be a black hole. I specify my thought. The form is sent but nobody to read it.Shocktrain est une arme de faible, au moins autant que l'était l'hydra. Pas de risque et des dégâts à coups sûrs.. le problème n est pas tant sa puissance, un orkan fait d'énorme dégâts et personne ne s'en plaint.. le problème c'est que quand tu en a 4, 5 voir 6 en face équipés full shocktrains mk2 et bien... tu fait comme tout le monde, tu arrêtes de jouer.. parce que franchement même en se payant des dash et des shocktrains, on voit plus l'intérêt de jouer.. 0 stratégie. Je me cache a 600m, je sort je tire, je me cache a 600m, je sort je tire.... wow quel ennuie !#Thanks pix for making tanker reporting centerapparently I must be playing a different game to Tofsla. my experience, when playing solo I can never get into a game of KOH, the timer goes to 3 and 5 minutes without finding a game. makes me think that nobody is really playing KOH, the concept anyway is not very intelligent people running from the one beacon to the next, by the way I found this mode incredibly easy to win and usually the two team bars are very low and it matters who got the first beacon or how the next beacons lit up. in some maps like yamantau its a disaster, really some of the maps should be excluded from KOH.for TDM, this has become an extremely boring game mode. everybody sits back waiting for the other person to come. the only thing that could make this mode interesting would be a circle of death ala player unknown with everyone forcing to come to the center and annihilate each other. its not even a good game mode when you need to make destroy robots for the event tasks. whenever I get TDM I leave the battle immediately so I get replaced with another player, in this way I dont ruin other peoples experience and also I dont ruin my experiencing by spending 10 mins in boredom (yes TDM matches usually run the full length of the match). the \"group of many players who enjoys TDM\" really puzzles me, this mode is good for campers.the best would be for the player to have his own choice to group 2+2 game modes in two different buttons according to his preference. this would make two matchmaking queues as is now and let the players enjoy the game mode they like.still the main flow of the game has not been addresses. its really hard to compete in champions with overpowered opponents that have 5 hangars all mk2. why should these people be pitted against normal hangars without any mk2 weapons and have a 20% advantage on everything? its not sporting or a challenge for them and definitely not fair for the other players. matchmaking needs to be improved to take into consideration hangar power - in this way tanking would not be possible anymore or be reduced significantly.Since you decided to ban my second fb account from posting on your page I hear you loud and clear- you don’t want me as a player anymore so I will spend my money on Battle Titans instead. Way to piss off your player base. You guys are the worst company, I am looking forward to the full release of Battle Titans and your downfall. Phu Q mail.ru. I hope you fail before you recoup your $30 million investment and I hope your whole team gets aids and dies.You don't need to nerf the shock, it's the pairing with the bulgasari that is the problem. Either nerf the bulgasari shield or buff trident to deal with the pairing of bulgasari and shocktrain. Make trident continuous fire like all the other rockets.HEATHEN CAT, I avreeETC ROBLES, What will stop them them from their ultimate goal, which is to drop leagues for weaker competition, is to limit the use of higher leveled bots and weapons in the lower leagues. Take away their advantage and they are just players that can't utilize what most players develop through slow growth, which are a couple of things called skill and strategy. They are only low life's in the game, and pretty much in their daily life too.ETC ROBLES, If that were the reality of how it is, that would be acceptable, but that isn't even close. Where do you think most of the tankers end up? The money player tankers with the leveled up bots. They are in the lower leagues dominating the weaker and frugal players, then excuse that as some type of legitimate gaming. It is just low class assery. The developers have created the majority of these player issues just to cause strife and piss off some to pay for upgrades and new stuff, thinking it will help them get even or some lame thing like that. All it does is enrich the developer. Look at how they are constantly nerf in and buffing bots and weapons. It totally misleads the player in thinking that they are getting what they pay for, only to have it nerfed shortly afterwards. That is called fraud in most places, in Russia it is called business as usual. Just remember who runs so the game every time you get pissed at something in the game.Everybody needs to lower their star rating to a more appropriate rating for the game 1 * that's all they deserve until they can stop their greedy ways why have a giveaway game if you're going to cheat people on it how stupid is that I have this really big green handled tool that you guys need to borrow is specifically designed to pull your head out of your assHere's a question for the Developers if you have 10 million downloads and a 2 million rating 2 million people rating your game why is there any wait times at all if you have so many players or is it because all your players who quit playing because of your selfish greed because I know for myself that I would spend more money on your game if your stuff was more reasonably priced and not so greedily priced and you'd probably have way more players logging on to play the game then there wouldn't be any wait times now with their but I don't know you guys have to make all your money on one person all at once instead of off of thousands of people a little at a time your ignorance amazes me because it seems anybody that develops a game this good should be smart but I guess that isn't the case here well like Forest mama said stupid is as stupid does keep up the stupid good work guysGlad to hear that you are going to address long standing issues.I have perfect solution for modes problem. YOU SAY THAT IF YOU SEPARATE ALL MODES MATCHMAKING WILL TAKE A LONG TIME THEN DO ONE THING. HAVE 4 SEPARATE OPTIONS FOR EVERY MODE PLUS RANDOM MODE.PLAYERS WHO WANT TO SPECIFICALLY WANT TO PLAY A SINGLE MODE CAN CHOOSE IT AND HAVE PATIENCE WITH THE WAITING TIME. I'LL ALWAYS DO THAT. AND THOSE WHO WANT TO PLAY INSTANTLY CAN CHOOSE RANDOM MODE WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY TIME.PLEASE CONSIDEER THIS AND ALSO CONSIDER GIVING 1 FREE HANGER SLOT TO EVERYONE.ETC ROBLES, A better solution  maybe to combine ALL games with beacons and leave TDM as a separate option.  This would encourage lighter/faster bot in beacon modes and leave the heavy hitters for TDM.  Yeah,  that would do.I see you guys saying your going to buff wild bunch robots, a few weeks ago you were rebuffing older bots to make them more viable. Changes will surface on the test sever you say. Well I just watched the lastest test sever. I saw nothing of revamping anything older to bring it to the forefront. I did however see more new weapons, they going to cost in excess of a hundred dollars like the latest ones? You added one new weapon and made it around 40 dollars, the medium vortex, made it easier to get, didn’t seem to need yet another missle/rocket weapon that wrecks most of a bots health in a single volley from where I’m setting. 3 new bots as well, more stealth bots, bot that jump and force land and take half the older bots health when they land, don’t need weapons , just landing cause over 20000 damage to anything near, and of course the hellburner, chaos, you seem to want chaos on the live server. Your not updating anything older, your just adding new content as fast as you can crank it out. Not to mention grouping all the fun modes into one random button. You win , I give, I see nothing positive happening, I’m not free to play, I did spend and it was a lot, I won’t say as I don’t wish anyone to think me some braggart. But I will say no more, I had a clan, I just turned over leadership to another member and I won’t play another battle. I’ll leave the game on my devices to check back a few times to see if someone at least attempts to fix the mess the new content has created. I’ve lost all faith in your company and won’t risk my money on any future game either. One more paying player out the door, seems you would stop this madness, I hung in there and kept hoping, apparently in vein. Congrats enjoy the chaos. I’m out , no more.I've known pix is a Russian company, that being said anyone who isn't Russian have another reason not to pay to play and probably the most important one is any $ spent here will in one way or another most likely be allocated to there military in efforts to expand The size of there country and destabalize any peace that's left in the world and I'd go so far as to say start WWIII. I'm also guessing that this game is collecting any and all Intel on players and any other valuable pieces of intel they can gather on there enemy's which is everybody l, especially Americans.....About the game modes , I have a good Idea but first we need to understand that any mod have a 3 type of players , players who love the mode , and those who just accept the mode , and players who hate the mode so how about (rotating an increase in battle rewards) on the game modes ? it would be like :-1- make the players chose any mode they want to play (no more random mode)2- declare an increase in rewards on one of the modes so the players  so the players who love the mode be satisfied and those who accept the mode find it more interesting to play , and then the players who hate the mode still can chose the mode thy find it fun to play .3- move the increase in reward to another mode like this you will satisfy all kind of players , and reward those who can play any mode , and also those who want's to play only one mode can have won't be sad because they are forced to play modes they hate . for example , I love BR , I accept Domination and KotH , and I really hate TDM ... when I see an increase in rewards on BR I'll be happy , when I see it on Domination or KotH I'll play them to have more rewards , and when I see more rewards TDM I can continue playing BRThere is a difference between constructive criticism and whining/ bit***** I see mostly whining/ bitc**** which helps nothing at all, in fact it does nothing at all but make yourself look bad and tell others just how misserable a person you are. If you hate the game and modern day buisness practices that turn profits (crazy right? People earning money and keeping investors happy to stay afloat and be competative!!!!) Nobody is making you play so there's the door let it hit u on the way out!!!I cannot understand how PIXONIC manages to ignore the much higher percentage of negative feedback on their own media feeders. Here, FaceBook, YouTube, no media oulet is without a greater majority of negative comments. And yet PIXONIC tries to make us believe that everything is great and that those in the gaming community making the negative comments are in the minority. It's as though they are simply blind to the mayhem they have caused in the game. Actually it appears worse. They are choosing to be DELIBERATELY blind to it.One might note that there was once a gamer-developers roundtable created to bring forth gamer issues and to discuss future development in the game. PIXONIC's developers must not have liked the truth of that discussion because they never once reached out to the community again after that.And PIXONIC keeps claiming it is \"listening to\" the players but it is more than apparent to most of us that they are not. They are just lying right to our faces about it over and over again. Is this just a moral aspect of the company or is it a much deeper social trait of the people who are running the company?Echo Alpha 94, Echo... You're  right, any Noob can use Shocktrains... But they'll  have to pay big $$$ to get them fast.  Ever get slaughtered by 3 snipers with Trebuchets? I don't think they're in discussion to Nerf those.  Having Shocktrains makes you Target #1 for the Reds.  Shocktrains are fine the way they are.I've  been playing WR since August 2017 and deeply enjoy the game.  The level of competition IS set by player.  Play for free and enjoy the game at lower leagues or invest with money for premium equipment to compete at higher leagues.  Whichever you choose,  just remember  to have fun... It's  just a game.   ;-)These are solely my opinion and not intended to upset anyone.Nerfing: Nerfing should happen in the development  stage of weapon or bot and NEVER once it has gone LIVE.  This is what the test sever is for.  Developers should take stock in what Test Server Youtubers say about their weapon or bot while in development.  Once a weapon system or bot is placed on the Live Server it should have undergone all the tweeks and nerfing required. Nerfing something once it comes out undermines those who have saved components or spent money on that item.  You don't buy a car with 400 horse power to have the dealership do a recall to reduce power 10%. Nerfing after a product comes out shows poor management in development and a quick way to upset players who have invested to have these items. Conversely, fans will accept an increase in weapon system power.  Example....Increasing Molot damage made them relevant in higher leagues. Some premium weapons just aren't worth the commitment to acquire components. (Arbalest needs more power to be worth acquiring it). Leave Shocktrain the way it is.Leaving and Tanking: No real solution here.  Folks are going to do what they want to do but there should be a way of removing gifts from them.  Once a system is in place to DEFINE and IDENTIFY \"Tanking\" and \"Seal Clubing\", those suspected of it should receive no supply drops,  no gold,  no keys,  no free chests and be placed in low game priority. Will this stop them... no,  but at least they will not be receiving any additional benefits enjoyed by honest players.Supply Drops: This was done RIGHT by Pixonic.  There should be a small gift for just loging in and playing a bit. I do agree that the FANS should have a voice in what components are available in Supply Drops but having premium bots every month is unreasonable. Maybe a month long drop of a weapon and every now and then a week long drop of premium bot components.Workshop 2.0: This has to come online and allow players to build components for items they desire.  Currently,  the ONLY way to get components is to receive them from chests, supply Drops,  use work shop points to buy them (VERY limiting)  or pay a ridiculous amount of real money for them.   $300 US for a bot?  1.5 years to acquire enough components?  Workshop 2.0 is important to build up to New levels of equipment and gameplay.Modes: Modes should be separated but I do understand how this would cause long wait times for certain modes.  A good compromise would be to split the modes as follows.... Domination with Beacon Rush and Team Death match with King of the Hill.Our problem with Shocktrain is not only about its high damage. Orkan is also very lethal but no one has complaints. Why? Because using Orkan in a effective way and dealing damage while surviving in the battlefield requires perfect skills. While Shocktrain is not so. Any stupid newbie who had purchased it can dominate a team of skillful veterans. Its damage and its range are both too high.You have effectively banished a large portion of players with Random. No amount of rewards will cause players to enjoy playing game modes that they do not like or enjoy. And punishing players for daring to defy PIXONIC's singular decree that they play those modes or else will only drive off more players.I stopped playing the moment 3.7 hit the servers. With Random I have only a 33% chance of playing the one game mode that I actually enjoy. Open my mind to other experiences? I tried the other modes and I simply do not like them. I do not want to play them, ever. And so I will not play at all.I will not be punished like a willful child by a gaming company. I am an adult who has every right to choose for myself whether I enjoy an experience or not. And no amount of prodding by PIXONIC will ever change that fact. I've been a loyal occasionally paying customer and player for well over a year. But that all ended the moment that PIXONIC began to decide for me that which I and others must enjoy.I feel as though I have wasted my money on a hanger that I can no longer play with. Not without facing the inevitable happening of being placed in the LPQ for choosing not to stay in BR, TDM and KotH matches.The game is falsely advertised as a game of PvP combat. But that is no longer the case. It has become a rigged gambling and carnival event of relentless strings of tasks for the acquisition of paltry rewards. Teamwork and winning are no longer the main game features anymore. They are not even the secondary features. The game has become all about the individual and utter selfishness. Rank tanking and clubbing are accepted by PIXONIC as they simply refuse to make the necessary changes to stop it. Not only that but PIXONIC has been endorsing it continually with challenges and sponsorships of videos portraying bad gamesmanship and anti-team behaviours. This is best illustrated with the recent Foolawround challenges where players were actually encouraged to video themselves doing their very best to be a bad player either through their bot builds or by their gaming behaviour or both. Ever heard of the word hypocrisy, developers?TryAgainNextTime, Why used the balanced inquisitor when you can get an op spectre with more firepower, more speed, and faster cooldown time?Naval Shank, That's how it should be.*SQUATCH*, Just saying, but I believe there is a difference between tanking and simply leaving. I think they're trying to say that if you need cut your arm then get a bandage, not continue playing. If you need to use the restroom and it is an emergency, then it is ok to turn off your game. Combining domination, beacon rush, and TDM is a nightmare. I think TDM should be combined with king of the hill, so the ones with sufficient beacons will be there if you need it, and the newer modes on the other button. I also agree that the points provided per beacon and the rate it is given should be increased.I agree the shocktrain nerf is awesome! Though that alone is not enough to thoroughly balance the game. The redeemer is obsolete to the ember, haechi left fujin in the dust, dragoon is a nightmare, arbalest is like trying to penetrate bullet-proof armor with a foam toy dart gun, and so on. And if something is too op no matter how much they nerf it (*cough* *cough* *spectre* *cough*).I agree with changing the rewards for the events, though they kind of in a way did that with the second half of the chain.Dave Dave Crook, I believe tanking will never be fixed no matter how hard they try unless they come up with an ingenious solution that encourages tankers to not tank instead of forcing them to not tank. What I mean is there are many kinds of tankers and leavers with different reasons to tank. LPQ is really a quitters/leavers league than a tankers. I have to admitShocktrain is being used as a BRAWLING WEAPON! I used a punisher hover earlier today to try to take out an annoying shocktrain bulgasari. I snuck close into the punisher's effective range with nearly full health, but came out with almost nothing at such a close range. Another time I had problems with shocktrain was I was in an ancilot trying to make it to the other side on yamantau, but nearly all the health I lost (I had around 20% health after them all shooting at me) was from shocktrain. Another \"shocking\" time was when I used an ancilot, full health, then a shocktrain bulgasari and doc shocktrain came out and in a single shot of them shooting at me, those 7 shocktrains broke through my front plate, and I have a level 9 lancelot.Any planning on the new mode FFA (Free For All) Pixonic?pixonic, you can remove one random mode and make all this modesDave Dave Crook, you are right!!! random mode is all about hangars!Possible Shocktrain solutions: Make it so that if it the first shot hits a shield. 1. That shield causes it to bounce back to who shot it. 2. Change how the shot fired travels. If the weapon is a 500m weapon. It should not hit anything else out of the 500m range of the bot that shot it. Meaning it can't hit a guy 500m away then bounce to a guy 600m away from you. 3. Nerf/reduce it's power. It's really a bit ridiculous. 4. Maybe set limits on what weapons can be turned MK2. So there's more control over weapons on the entire platform too.Is it just me, or is this just a forum for everyone to criticize Pixonic.I'm fed up pix/mail with they're ability of lying but don't have the ability to fix the real issues here. The random modes is designed to get the players to spend more $$$ on more hangars to play a specific style for that mode . There was never any real problem with the queue waiting time since the day of this game was born, watch any old clips of war robot youtubers playing solo matches.  notice any waiting time take no more than 60 seconds? .Shocktrain get nerf because payxonic bagged enough money so they get nerf. This how pay 2 win is designed selling power over skill. If player's stick to one play style,  payxonic won't make money.  what you do? You nerf an item and introduce a new item that is better. This push out the old meta and put them into a new meta play style. The report tanking form is a joke if they actually fixed the MM they wouldn't  need  a form. 2.0 work shop is taking forever because they're not making any money out of it. The community has addressed the main issues here billions of time and  yet payxonic & mail has always steered the other direction.  I can draw a line that payxonic &  mail are only focused on selling power over the moral player's value.  In another word, this game is a selling service.I'm fed up pix/mail with they're ability of lying but don't have the ability to fix the real issues here.

But that doesn’t mean it’s okay to ruin what other people like to play with even if you just have it. Workshop 2.0 will definenly help people who need higher tier weapons, and if shocktrain will be easier for people to get, more people will stop complaining about is. I’m really exited for workshop 2.0 as it will get me the robot I’ve been wanting sconce it came out (*cough* *cough* Bulgasari) and it will help newer players become better than a G.I Patton hanger. In conclusion, shocktrain needs only a small nerf, and workshop 2.0 definetly needs to come out.A couple cmments...Re: Workshop 2.0Gosh, with the pain-points of all various Component deals and inconsistant WSP-Comonent deals leaving me to face facts that Im–for whatever reason– not 'allowed' to get equipment I once wanted despite entering WR 3.0 update. Once having over 130k WSP points that were strategicaly spent on certain deals for desired equipment, I have become complacent with what I have vs. what I desired.Complacency leads to apathy and apathy does no good for any business.So, PLEASE TAKE YOUR TIME considering WORKSHOP revamps. Steive for positive pro-player results rather than just seemingly to consider economic impact.RE: Supply Drops.I wish the Components were universal rather than specific toward individual items... So I could get what I desire rather than what Im ALLOWED to get. But really, that is a seperate issue sortof, I guess.Re: Leaving vs. TankingThis section sounds more like a THREAT rather than an actual attempt to correct something. The time for Threats are over. Action and follow-thru are needed for Leavers, Tankers and FADERS. Dont forget the faders!Its all of the Talk (threats) minus action that is leading others to misinterpret you as supporting such actions. Talk without action is just talk. Talking about action makes you more part of the problem than a solution. Choose to be a solution.\"leaving a match in many cases is still ok\" so yes you do support the idea of tanking. To fix tanking simply fix the league system, that is what gives tankers the ability to tank. The 20% 30% that play king of the hill is not legit. Some people play it to get away from the mess that is random mode. I would be one of them however it takes 10+ minutes to get a match of king of the hill in champion league.Nerfing shocktrain is great. However when it was first seen in the test server under the name chain lightning the vast majority hated it. A few months pass and you put it in the game and rename it shocktrain. Maybe listen to the player base and the need to nerf weapins and bot would not be needed shortly after the release of the items. Events have become beyond stagnet. We get the same thing over and over again with different decorations. Three different events would be much better. You can then rotate them so they reamin somewhat fresh.As for the link to the test server site. The most recent artical on it us from mid November of last year. So i see no reason for this site.Can we report Mail.ru & PIxonic for ruining the experience, via a gross Pay-to-Win strategy?  As a vet who did the grind, embraced the suck, and spent RM for his max level hangar, getting pounded by full Dash/Inquisitor, Mk2 L12 squads ruins MY gameplay experience.  Get WS 2.0 in the game STAT.  Stop introducing more bots & weapons and deal with issues like the Taran bug, underpowered Redeemer, and a whacked MM, and then we can talk.If you were to combine the entirety off the player base we could have a bunch of game options. At least then we could really see who likes what.Naval Shank, Exactly.If you do a survey for components, and the overwhelming response is for the Spectre, will you really give us Spectre components, and will you do it long enough for us to complete it?If there are 4 game modes, three of which are \"random\", this KoTH news is all \"spin\". Especially during an event, when one \"random\" mode excludes the ability to cap beacons. I would bet it's only \"concurrent\" because pilots don't want to waste time having to play TDM, when the task they're completing is capping beacons. \"If we \"randomly\" ( 4 - 5 matches in a row) make them play TDM when they need beacons, it will boost the KoTH numbers!\"NO NO NO !!!TDM with KotHand Br with dominationnot KotH with BrCan't wait for workshop 2.0.

      "99 Levels to Hell is a 2D platform shooter by Danish developer bom667 and published by Zaxis Games. The game has 100 levels which are randomly generated, and they are divided into 10 sections of 10 levels each. Death in a section sends players back to the beginning of the section rather than the beginning of the entire game. In the game, players assume the role of a wizard and start off with a shotgun until they can find better means such as laser weapons or magic. As an arcade game the player is able to look any direction on the 2D screen, giving the ability to shoot, cast magic, or blast with a laser, anything anywhere on the screen.The game's story was written by Chris Powell and Graham Cookson (both have a small involvement in the gaming industry, including running the SEGA-related gaming publications www.seganerds.com and Mega Visions Magazine). It is read in poem form by the game's narrator when the player picks up story books throughout the game.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHardcoreGamer.com's James Cunningham rated the game 4 out of 5 saying, \"99 Levels to Hell is a fun and bloody descent into the not-quite-bottomless depths, loaded with replayability and almost impossible to put down until the poor explorer has lost his last heart of health.\"\n\n\n== References ==",
      "Please enable javascript to view this site.Gameverse | August 10, 2018TopSpelunky fans looking for a similar experience may want to sit up and take notice of this one. 99 Levels to Hell is a recently released action-platformer with light rogue-like elements by B-evil and Zaxis Games. The main idea is simple: Jump and shoot your way through 100 randomly-generated levels and 10 bosses. But, as you’ll quickly learn, that is much easier said than done.As I mentioned, 99 Levels to Hell will be pretty familiar to anyone who has played Spelunky before. Each level is randomly generated with an entrance and an exit. Before you can use the exit you’ll have to find a key somewhere on the level. Each level is also populated with monsters, traps, various power ups, and gold that can be spent in certain rooms that are randomly scattered around. Each level can be completed in just a few minutes, and if you stick around too long invincible ghosts will spawn and hunt you down.The rogue-like elements come in the form of permadeath. Once you die, that’s it. Every 10 levels you fight a boss and move on to a new area of the dungeon with more challenging enemies and traps. Every 10 levels also serves as a form of checkpoint system, so you can start a new game further along, but this will make things more difficult because there has been less time to collect items and get health upgrades before moving on to these more challenging levels.At the start of each playthough you’ll have a chance to pick a character, each with different starting weapons and stats. More characters can be unlocked by finding and saving them in rooms throughout the dungeon. Each character starts with a certain number of health points, some bombs used to get to otherwise unreachable areas, and a weapon that varies between characters. The Magician, for example, starts with a shotgun, while the Major starts with a machinegun. As you explore the levels you may find various new items in the form of weapons, orbs, and spells.Item variety is pretty good. Weapons range from various rods that shoot magic bolts like fire or ice, to a cannon that fires projectiles that do heavy damage on a direct hit but also bounce and roll around momentarily. Orbs circle your character and have different effects. Some are obvious, like how the Fire Orb shoots fireballs whenever you shoot your gun. Others will need to be figured out, like how the Red Orb restores a health point to you if it kills an enemy. Spells occupy your third item slot and are very powerful items that can generally only be used every so often. Some outright kill all enemies on the screen. Others are more support-based, like restoring health or giving you extra time to explore the level before the ghosts appear. After they are used, spells must be recharged by killing enemies.Occasionally you’ll find rooms that you can enter. There are casinos where you can spend money (Or even health, in some cases) to gamble with slot machines. Stores allow you to buy or upgrade items. Elevators allow you to go up or down levels. There is another type of room that provides some insight into the story, and occasionally these rooms will have a cage that can be destroyed to unlock a new character.The core gameplay of 99 Levels to Hell is simple and pretty easy to get into, but also fun and challenging. The weapons, orbs, and spells can be very satisfying, and the way they interact can create interesting combos. Enemies tend to explode into chunks of gore when killed. Both the platforming and shooting are pretty solid, and the controls are good regardless of if you are using a keyboard and mouse or a controller.On the other hand, this being a light rogue-like with randomly generated levels can lead to some frustrating moments outside of your control. For the most part the game is very challenging yet fair, but I have had some playthroughs where I just never found any good items. I have had a few times where I exited a room right into a monster, thus putting me in a situation where I took unavoidable damage. A handful of times the level generated in such a way that reaching the exit was actually impossible. After a while you’ll also discover that the levels aren’t quite as random as advertised. It seems like the developers created a bunch of templates that rearrange levels in random ways, so eventually you’ll start to see some pretty similar layouts.The aesthetic is a bit mismatched too. I actually like the cartoony art direction, even though the animations aren’t as smooth as they could have been, but the music and narration is darker and creepier than the actual visuals would suggest it should be. I’m still on the fence in regards to how well the two blend together.There are some performance issues here and there, too. The game’s initial load time is pretty long, to the point that I thought something went horribly wrong the first time I booted the game up. A few times I encountered bizarre drops below 30 FPS that could only be fixed by restarting my PC. The frame rate problems were very few and far between though; I’ve put about 10 hours into this game so far and it only happened twice.Overall I really enjoyed 99 Levels to Hell. The core gameplay can be very fun in short bursts, and the randomized nature of item drops makes replaying the game over and over again satisfying. Unlocking new characters can change up your playthroughs quite a bit because of their different starting items. At $10, or your regional equivalent, 99 Levels to Hell offers a lot of fun and replayability in a fairly cheap package. Many of the issues I had with the game were rather minor, and not bad enough to detract from the game as a whole. You can find 99 Levels to Hell on GOG.com, Desura, and IndieCity. It’s also struggling in the limbo that is Steam Greenlight, so remember to go give it a thumbs-up to help it get on Steam.Nice review… one might say, ‘frank’.Review: Borderlands 2 – Gaige the Mechromancer DLC5659 ViewsSkyrim: Hearthfire Review5643 ViewsXbox employees get white Xbox One design, jealous?5578 ViewsOuya game console kicks off strong5171 ViewsPath of Exile Release Date, Post-Launch Plans Announced5109 ViewsSkyrim: Dawnguard Review4750 ViewsToxicity in gaming: A relationship between industry and individualNovember 21, 2014Games about games, 2014’s hottest trendNovember 17, 2014Hearthstone arena pro-tips from BlizzconNovember 15, 2014Blizzcon’s Overwatch has yet to impressNovember 12, 2014With Mario Kart 8, Nintendo gets DLC rightNovember 12, 2014What Can We Do to Preserve Gaming’s Past?November 6, 2014This week, Nintendo rolls out the first of two downloadable content packs for the Wii U’s Mario Kart 8.

      "Indie game news, reviews, previews & developer interviewsadvertisementRoguelikes have become insanely popular in the indie game scene in the past couple of years. 99 Levels To Hell from Zaxis Games/B-evil feels like a mixture between two of the most popular Roguelike-likes out there: Spelunky and Edmund McMillen’s The Binding of Isaac. It has the 2D platforming aspects of Spelunky and the dual-stick shooter elements of The Binding of Isaac. It’s a fast paced Roguelike-like that emphasizes player skill and features permadeath along with randomized elements. But in a lot of ways 99 Levels To Hell still feels like a work in progress.The game is light on narrative as you slowly discover snippets about the world and history in the form of audio diaries. The diaries are read aloud, telling a story about two brothers. Unfortunately it’s not very compelling and feels sort of tacked-on. It’s obvious that the game’s main focus is on its gameplay, and hey there’s nothing wrong with that, if the gameplay delivers.You move using the left analog stick or WASD and jump using the left trigger or spacebar. Aiming your weapon is done with the right analog stick or the mouse, and the right trigger or the LMB fires your weapon. The mouse and keyboard controls feel a little awkward and I would recommend using the game’s built-in partial controller support.The controller method take a bit of getting used since the button layouts are unconventional. They are responsive however, and work well once your brain grabs hold. What the game eventually boils down to is jumping around, stopping to shoot monsters, and then jumping around some more. It gets pretty challenging since killing monsters requires precision and your complete attention. No watching Netflix at the same time!The prize is generally centered around a high-score system; killing monsters increases your score amount, and killing them in succession gives you a finite score multiplier. Once you die, you can see your final score and it’s connected to online leaderboards. The primary objective for each level is to find the key that unlocks a door, and then finding said door which leads to the next level.Every 10th level you will reliably encounter a boss. After you kill a boss, you gain a checkpoint. So if you die, you can start a new game on the 11th level or the 21 level and so on. Optional items can be found within each level: Gold helps you buy weapon upgrades, Bombs can be used to destroy certain blocks, Hearts are used to refill lost health, and Special Abilities that give you a permanent offensive or defensive power to help you through the game.In every level – excluding boss battle levels – you have a certain amount of time before powerful ghost enemies come out and attack you. Much like Spelunky, 99 Levels To Hell requires that you not overstay your welcome in any given level; it creates a certain pace for you to complete each level and it does a good job creating tense moments.The game is made up of 10 different dungeons, all comprising 10 levels in the style of its dungeon theme. The levels never feel varied enough (besides obvious texture swaps on repeated map layout).The game boasts “100 levels that spawn at random” but maps just aren’t ever all that interesting, or fun to traverse, which is where Binding of Isaac excelled. Beyond environmental traps, levels will also sometimes contain elevators or umbrellas that give you the ability to skip levels and progress faster. Even with these elements in place, levels don’t do enough to keep the gameplay interesting. The monotony starts to set in quickly as you’re basically doing the same thing over and over again ad nauseum.One aspect of the game I thought could have been better expanded upon was its bonus score objective system. At the start of some levels, you are sometimes given an objective to complete in order to obtain a score bonus. These objectives could have given you an interesting objective like: finish the level without killing a single enemy or complete the level only using bombs. Instead the objectives are either score a certain amount points which basically boils down to “kill a certain amount of enemies,” or, collect a certain amount of gold – two objectives that feel futile since it’s what you are basically doing in every level anyways.Although the maps may look similar, the game tries to mix things up by adding randomized items. Different weapons or special abilities make up most of these and are imperative to making your playthrough easier. The game relies on these items far too much. Success in this game is garnered by getting lucky and finding a shop that contains weapon upgrades or a special ability. If you don’t get lucky, bosses become extremely difficult since your starting character layout is so underpowered.You start off with a very short range shotgun and no special ability. This adds to the game’s difficulty substantially, especially if you were to start a new game from a check-pointed higher level wherein enemies are tougher and harder to kill. It often feels unbalanced when compared to other Roguelike-likes out there. You may go through all 9 levels of a dungeon and find zero weapon upgrades, no abilities, making the boss fight of that dungeon too frustratingly unfair.Visually the game is pretty bland but the lighting effects look nice. I had no issues with the game’s art style overall even though I felt it could have been more appealing. The music and sound effects support the game’s tone nicely and I had no issues there.99 Levels To Hell is a decent 2D platforming title with Roguelike elements. Judging by the discussion boards on Steam, it seems as if the developers are listening and plan on adding future updates to improve upon the game. The game at the moment feels like it’s in a state of beta testing, (as do a lot of indie games nowadays, particularly glaring given the euphemestic “Early Access” term now applied to them when they are in fact for sale on said marketplace).Ultimately this title is, at present, too repetitive and unbalanced to recommend.Rating:advertisementView previous campaigns.Powered by MailChimpadvertisementLast Post:Next Post:This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

      "One of the biggest changes to ever grace a game like League of Legends was its massive map overhaul back in 2014. The mega-popular MOBA made a name for itself with only a single true 5v5 map, Summoner’s Rift, and its eventual visual update was a very big deal back then. Arena of Valor sits in a similar position like most other MOBAs, and it looks set to follow in the in the footsteps of the games that came before. We’re back with another Arena of Valor news roundup, and we’re here to talk about more than just an updated map.The mage Liliana made a big splash across Arena of Valor when he launched earlier in the year – and it’s clear why. Everyone knows that mixing females with animal features – like cat ears and a tail – is a potent concoction those even remotely interested in the anime art style fall for. You can’t deny that it’s a questionable preference, but it’s one that’s stuck around for generations at the point.So throw an Idol – think a young, cutesy pop star – into the pot and you’re onto a clear winner. That’s exactly what’s happening with Liliana this week. Be prepared to see a lot more of the parasol-wielding caster for a while yet.We’ve seen her teased a few times before, but a nice little sing-a-long video tossed up on the Arena of Valor Facebook page a few days back signified her impending release. Fast-forward to this morning and the Idol Liliana skin has officially arrived. Just be aware that it’s actually cheaper to buy the bundle rather than the solo skin if you already own Liliana herself.If you thought Roxie couldn’t burn down the battlefield with her little rollerskates alone, you’d probably be right. Rather than having Zill ‘The Tempest’ fan the flames with his persistent cyclone, however, Tencent has tossed fuel and a match into his path, creating a blazing that has turned the underappreciated assassin into a towering inferno.Inferno Zill is his most expensive skin to date, but his smoldering blades and fire raging underfoot are impressive. Some might say he looks like a certain Final Fantasy summon, and we couldn’t agree more.If you tuned into the AWC – Arena of Valor World Cup – toward the end of last month, you might have just caught a glimpse at the future of the game. Arena of Valor is set to walk the same path as League of Legends by softening up its main map in a major visual overhaul.Monster and minion models are all set to take on very different forms, but it’s the lighter color palette that makes the biggest difference here. There’s no word on whether we can expect any meaningful performance improvements here, or whether the cosmetic changes miraculously use the same amount of resources as before. When tweaking a game that’s built around competitive play, ensuring everyone is playing on an even playing field is a major concern.We have no idea when these changes are set to make it into the game, but there’s a lot more to it than a simple visual tweak. The on-screen text may not be in English, but the voice-over will gladly tell you which jungle monsters will start to dish out some wildly different buffs and benefits. Popular AoV streamer Mal3ficarum embeds his face into the frame to give his impressions in the video above.Speaking of the AWC, it’s finally time for some post-game analysis to kick off. We were treated to well over 60 games throughout the lengthy tournament, and with many of the competing countries and locales having had access to the game far longer than places like Europe and North America, the strategies and skill on display couldn’t have been more different.It’s part of the reason why the Boot Camp phase took place shortly after the Valor Cup final at E3 to better prepare the homegrown teams for the types of challenges they’d be seeing from places like China. In the end, North America, Europe and even South America failed to bring home the prize, with Korea coming back from the losers bracket to finish off the team who sent them down there. But they tried their best!It was a true tale of revenge and redemption, and the hectic series makes for some good stat and strategy analysis if you’re into that sort of thing. Videos are starting to pop up on the Arena of Valor YouTube channel discussing the best and worst of the tournament, so anyone looking to give it their all in-game should use it to brush up on their skills.Now that we’re finally catching up to the heroes we’ve been watching on the test servers and predominantly Asian Arena of Valor content creators, you can bet yet another would show up to taunt us. We don’t expect to see this one for a long time yet, but Tencent is trialing a brand-new ranged hero – Elsu.Elsu is one fashionable man with prime ‘husbando’ qualities. The classic ‘tall, dark and handsome’ line comes to mind here. The new ranged attacker is unlike any we’ve seen before, though. Donning a gorgeous cape and bird of prey on his left arm, Elsu carries with him a massive hunting rifle.He’s a little Lindis with the traps he sets and a little Ryoma with his jump, but it’s his secondary ability that’s a cause for concern. It take a while to aim, but once it does, Elsu looks to have one of the longest ranged attacks in the game, meaning he’ll be able to shut down fleeing targets with ease – especially during the laning phase.",

      "99 Levels To Hell is a platformer that teaches players two things: it’s not easy to get to Hell and you might die a lot in the process.99 Levels To Hell is a 2D platformer developed by Zaxis Games and B-evil and published on multiple digital distribution platforms, like Steam and Desura. We tested the game on Steam, but I think it’s the same experience no matter the platform.I can only imagine a meeting of the developers before putting together the ideas for this game, and it might have gone down like this:“So, we need to make a game about a character going to Hell. We’ll make it procedurally generated so he doesn’t pass through the same level twice. How many levels? Let’s say ten. Do the ghost bleed? Sure, why not.”A day later, the concept still seemed incomplete so they went back and imagined something harder. “10 levels are too few, let’s make it 99. It’s less than 100, but there are so many that most likely nobody will be able to finish the game.”Before embarking on the trip for the 99 Levels To Hell, you must understand that this is an extremely difficult game. You might think that the sheer size of it will make you tremble, but there is a culmination of factors, about which we will talk in just a moment.GameplayThe first character that you control in the game uses a shotgun and, to be frank, it must be the number one choice for anyone. If you ever had a choice of weapons before descending into the bowels of Hell, a shotgun is probably at the top of a very long list.Like any good 2D platforming game, you start in a small hub with locked doors to the sublevels. The progression is pretty simple – you play ten levels, the tenth being a boss fight that unlocks the next set.The levels are procedurally generated, which means that the general layout of the walls, enemies, keys, locked doors, and pretty much everything, will be in a different place after you die. And that will happen a lot, especially in the beginning, until you learn what you have to do to stay alive.If you ever played a 2D game, the mechanics of 99 Levels To Hell shouldn’t feel too different. You jump and shoot your weapon at everything that moves. Everything is smeared with a copious amount of blood whenever you kill it, making the players feel they are in a very gory type of game.The goal is simple, or at least appears to be simple. You need to find the key and the locked door. Some levels have entrances to other, smaller rooms, like mazes or shops. There is a twist though.You might feel that the game is pretty easy, at least in the beginning. The character moves rather fast, the shotgun is a very powerful weapon, and you make short work of most enemies. The problem is that every level has an allocated time limit, which is not visible to the player.The music changes and the level starts to fill up with gas (which doesn’t appear to harm the character) and it’s flooded with immortal creatures, like ghosts and so on, which bleed but don’t die. The only way to kill one is to leave behind a bomb, of which you have a limited quantity, in the style of Bomberman. You might hit it or you might not, but that's your cue to leave.As for the life of the character, this is a rogue-like game, which means that, once you die, you lose all the progress you made that far. It takes a lot to kill your character, which has a lengthy life (unlike the Binding of Isaac, for example), but the end result is pretty much the same.The enemies also get a lot tougher as you progress but, besides gold and other trinkets, you will uncover upgrades for your weapon and other kinds of protections, like a glowing rotating orb, for example.You will also find other weapons, but they are usually provided later in the game, after you have already upgraded your primary weapon. I never wanted to replace the main weapon, mainly because it was too powerful by that time to just ditch somewhere.From a graphical standpoint, 99 Levels To Hell is not half-bad. Sure, it doesn’t have the engine of triple-A titles, but it’s more than enough for what the developers wanted to achieve. You will be way too trapped in the frenzy of the action to notice anything else.",
      "The founder of up-and-coming review aggregator OpenCritic has accused rivals Metacritic of using the site’s data without permission.I wonder what scores our list of upcoming PC games will average out at.In a press release sent out today, founderMatthew Enthoven said, “We didn’t know if we should be proud or outraged when we took a look at Metacritic this morning and saw that they had OpenCritic’s review data and information on their site.“On the positive side, we were excited to see another industry giant stand alongside companies such as Insomniac Games, Nvidia and Telltale in presenting OpenCritic as an authority. However, we’re frustrated that we did not receive recognition and have requested that they either credit OpenCritic or begin licensing our API and databases.”Basically, OpenCritic seem to have found a way to more efficiently grab the review data to fill up the site once an embargo lifts. According to Enthoven, Metacritic are just swiping at least some of this data from them, rather than sourcing it from the outlets themselves, without crediting them.“If you can’t see how they copied us, we wouldn’t blame you – we make subtle, near-invisible changes to various review data to tag it using a system we call ‘horsemen’, Enthoven explained. “For example, with PCGamer’s Blood and Wine review, we added a redundant slash after pcgamer.com. With Twinfinite’s review, we capitalized the “W” and “B” in the review URL.“We can’t detail every example as it would give away our tells, but these two are notable: Metacritic’s Blood and Wine page currently has these exact horsemen listed, leading us to believe that they’ve begun sourcing reviews from OpenCritic. These changes don’t interfere with the user experience and are unique to OpenCritic. We checked to make sure that these links did not appear on popular websites such as Neogaf and reddit. We also feel confident in claiming that we listed these URLs first. As with most games, OpenCritic was faster: in this case, three hours faster.”The ‘horsemen’ were built into the system to protect the site’s work, in the same way old cartographers would add fake place to maps and phone books would leave in fake numbers – it’s like a fingerprint for their work, basically.I really like OpenCritic’s setup, as it doesn’t alter scores because they’re not on the /10 scale and it actually credits the critics, going as far as having a page for each one. Mine even has my face on it, it’s great.As Enthoven puts it: “We’re the only aggregator that correctly credits authors in addition to publications. We’re the only aggregator that lets users pick-and-choose their trusted publications. And unlike Metacritic, all of our scores are presented as simple averages with no hidden weightings, using data that can be verified by the public.“As we announced last January, our API alpha is in full swing and will soon shift into beta. We hope that Metacritic and others will consider joining our beta and licensing our API.”I emailed Enthoven to see what the company plans to do about the current situation, to which he responded: “We don’t intend to proceed beyond this statement and the letter that we’ve sent to [Metacritic owners] CBS Interactive. The legal precedents are not in our favor, nor would we want to engage in any legal proceedings. We can think of no faster way to drain funds and lose momentum.“Our intent here was to send a strong message to Metacritic that we are a serious competitor and that we will continue to call them out on practices that don’t advance the industry overall, including sourcing from us without credit.”ShareClicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.PromotedHow to master Monster Hunter: World’s deep combat system7 reasons you should return to RuneScape and Old School RuneScapeWhy a visit to Monster Hunter: World should be your videogame summer vacation",

      "There are certain expectations one would get from a game titled 99 Levels to Hell. Things like the game’s ultimate destination, how many areas you need to clear to reach it, and maybe even the assumption of an overall theme. 99 Levels to Hell delivers on all fronts, but that’s just the start of the depth of content in this cartoonishly bloody, violent, randomized 2D action platformer.Apparently, you’re stuck at the entrance to hell, and the only way out is through. You play as a mustachioed chap with a shotgun of limited range but decent power, blasting enemies and picking up gold and any other goodies you see along the way. Each level is a free-scrolling affair, randomly generated but with strict parameters that ensure there’s always a path to every part of the map. The basics are simple enough– find key to open exit, blast enemies, pick up gold, escape. Every ten levels there’s a boss fight that, if you win, allows you to skip past it on the next playthrough. Beat the level 10 boss and you can start the next game at level 11, if you don’t mind passing up all the upgrades you might have come across along the way.The starting shotgun is a good weapon, and it packs a nice punch against the early-game monsters, but it’s not going to stay like that for long. Fortunately there are new weapons to find, as well as permanent power-ups that increase shot size and range, and even level-up items to grant the gun new capabilities. Once you pick up a new weapon the old one and its power-ups are gone, however, so it can be a hard choice when running across something new. Fun as it is to find a gun that shoots bubbles, trapping enemies inside as they bobble to the ceiling, it’s hard to let go of a twin-orb firing staff with bouncing shots.There are plenty of other random bits scattered through the dungeon as well. Shops sell goodies, slot machines are a great way to lose cash quickly, rare story rooms reveal pieces of the plot, elevators shoot you down several levels in a shot, and various other items do various other things. The fun of discovery keeps the action flowing along, so even when you die and start again (no continues) the repetition is minimal.Nice as it is to deal with the randomization, though, the real star of the show is the blood-spattered action. 99 Levels to Hell is a fast paced shooter/platformer, and the dungeon’s monsters are numerous and troublesome. They’re also packed with splattery blood that flies everywhere when they’re shot, and when you’ve got a subsection filled with wandering green piles of goo plus flying bats, it’s going to be drenched in red particle effects by the time you’re done. Shooting can be done using either mouse and keyboard or twin-stick controls and ammo is infinite, so there’s no reason not to turn every enemy in the level into a red smear.There’s enough going on in each level that it can actually take a bit to realize that 99 Levels to Hell has only one notable issue, and that’s a bad case of programmer art. Most enemies float or move with the bare minimum of animation, and while the art is serviceable, that’s the best that can be said. This is a game that needs to be in motion, and fortunately there’s rarely a moment to rest. The dynamic lighting and particle effects do a great job of masking the art issue, on the rare occasion when the game settles down long enough for it to be noticeable. If the action has slowed down long enough to notice, though, that generally means it’s time to head for the level exit.Closing Comments:99 Levels to Hell is all about action, jumping gaps and gunning down hordes of enemies in the finest arcade traditions. The giant strand of Spelunky DNA tying its genetic makeup together covers the random items, events, and level layouts, but it creates its own identity with the fast-paced action. 99 Levels to Hell is a fun and bloody descent into the not-quite-bottomless depths, loaded with replayability and almost impossible to put down until the poor explorer has lost his last heart of health. Another round couldn’t hurt, right?",

      "In the newly released graphical adventure game Post Mortem, you play as Gustave MacPherson, a former private eye. Gustave is an American expatriate living in Paris and trying to eke out a living as a painter. When contacted about a strange murder by a stereotypically mysterious dame named Sophia Blake, he cracks easily. Though you, as Gustave, are allowed to say \"no\" to the would-be client, eventually you'll have to take the case...unless you actually want to pace back and forth in Gustave's tiny studio for the remainder of the game. The fact that you have the option to turn down Ms. Blake's offer is interesting and shows one of Post Mortem's best features: Specifically, the choices you make while conducting your investigation actually affect the game, presenting new puzzles, new solutions, and new destinations based on what you do and when you do it. While the system doesn't work so well in this instance, in other situations it does, and in one particularly inspired section of the game, it actually, single-handedly, keeps Post Mortem from being just another rote adventure game. Unfortunately, the game doesn't generally put enough emphasis on its own interesting features, and the rest of the time, it's just another formulaic adventure.The inspired sequence mentioned above involves a scene in which Gustave tracks down a primary suspect in the beheading of two American tourists. He and the suspect sit and talk, and the game suddenly places you in the role of the suspect. You control his actions on the day of the murder, and what you do affects what information is available to Gustave once the flashback ends. It's an interesting take on the normal investigative adventure game formula and is one that may lead you to believe the whole game will be a series of similar flashbacks. Unfortunately, this is the only time it happens, and the rest of the game is just a typical series of sealed doors with mysterious machines for locks.Not that there are many sealed doors. For an adventure game, Post Mortem has a notable lack of traditional puzzles. There are only a handful, and most of them are fairly easy, with two exceptions. One puzzle, the game's best, involves deciphering an alchemical formula and then using it to create a mysterious compound. It's fairly difficult, if only because it requires several layers of deciphering to even understand what you need to do. But it makes sense in the context of the game, a rare thing in modern adventure games. On the other hand, Post Mortem also includes what may be the single most boring puzzle ever devised--one that requires you to slowly drag a lit candle over a painting over and over again until hidden images reveal themselves.This lack of puzzles indicates another problem with Post Mortem: It's surprisingly short. The only things that keep it from being less than 10 hours long are the lengthy dialogue sections, which unfortunately can't be sped up or skipped. The dialogue is decent, but occasionally you're given access to information that you haven't learned yet. When you first meet with Sophia Blake, for instance, you can ask about her \"sister's murder\" before you even learn anything about the murder. This is a minor problem, though. The major problem is that the voice acting is plodding, as if everyone involved agreed that repeated and stilted pauses would make everyone sound more dramatic. Seriously--characters speak so slowly they make William Shatner sound like a hyperactive auctioneer at a county fair. Moreover, both the French and American characters speak with the same sort of fake, overenunciated English (and, strangely, everyone pronounces the word \"heir\" as \"hair\"). The voice acting is poor in general--including elderly women that sound exactly like young women trying to sound like elderly women and failing--but, sadly, that's almost an expectation in contemporary adventure games. Neither are the graphics noteworthy. The backgrounds are muddy and dull, and the characters move like marionette footage set on an endless loop. Though they look fine, after watching their standard animation--touch eyeglasses, wave hands, repeat--a dozen or so times, it becomes tiring.The plot, too, offers nothing unexpected. Though it starts off like a typical tale of murder and betrayal like The Maltese Falcon, it eventually turns to the supernatural. It would be a spoiler to tell you the story unfolds to reveal a connection to the Knights Templar, if it weren't for the fact that every adventure game set in Europe since Circle of Blood has unfolded to reveal a connection to the Knights Templar. Post Mortem is self-conscious enough to make a joke about typical adventure game plots (at one point Gustave sarcastically asks someone about lost civilizations), but it apparently isn't self-conscious enough to avoid these cliché plots itself.Hopefully Post Mortem's developers will take note of their game's particular strengths and incorporate them in another game that will elaborate on the innovative ideas that are presented here but not explored. Post Mortem is a decent adventure game, and fans of the genre who are easily pleased will find it simple and short, but entertaining while it lasts. But it's the occasional appearance of something different--the alternate solutions, the flashback through another's eyes--that makes most of Post Mortem seem dull and typical in comparison.We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.Use your keyboard!",

      "So the GameSparks crew are back from GDC (Game Developers Conference) and Game Connection in San Francisco as well as the Microsoft Cloud Gaming Summit in London. We have been super busy the last two weeks in March and into the first 2 weeks of April. With more events coming up like the Update Show in Manchester next week we have been on the road pretty much non stop and it has been a blast.We started with San Francisco for two events ran in the same week. The first was Game Connection where developers all gather for pre scheduled meetings that last 30 minutes. It takes a sort of speed dating format where one side talks about their product whether  it’s a game, middleware or some sort of publishing platform etc, then the other talks about their product and they decide if the could or could not do business together. Each company exchanges their contact details to follow-up on as business is never done in 30 minutes. This format is great for developers looking to find publishers or collaborators on projects.For us it was great as we got to meet a lot of people who are looking into games as a service aka “gaas” or cloud gaming backend solutions specifically. The devs we met either knew exactly what they wanted or were looking for more information on “gaas” as they were having trouble developing their own backend. So GameSparks was ideal for these developers and we got a lot of really positive feedback. It was also good to see that developers are really starting to understand that “gaas” or cloud gaming is definitely the future of game development. Those who understood it and seen the GameSparks platform were generally blown away which gave us more and more confidence with every meeting we took.Game Connection took place from Monday March 17th to Wednesday March 20th in the Sir Francis Drake hotel on Mason street in San Francisco which is right beside Union Square and the Mason Powell cable car line, so basically right in the heart of San Francisco. On the Wednesday we were also in GDC with a booth in the UKIE stand so our team split up for the day. Myself (Jamie O’ Flanagan) and our CEO Griff Parry attended the expo and other meetings scheduled in the Moscone conference centre area while our CMO John Griffin captained the last day of Game Connection.GDC and the days of the expo also had a meeting schedule format which could be done through the meetings.gdconf.com website where you can arrange to meet other exhibitors or expo visitors at a predetermined location, usually one of the exhibitor booths or the registration area. All and all between Game Connection and GDC GameSparks had over 80 scheduled meetings with about another 40-50 impromptu meetings or booth visits from industry professionals who were interested in games as a service. On top of that the various different networking events hosted every evening which are in some cases just as if not more important than the conference itself where we met developers from AAA studios to small indies just chatting about their games and shooting the breeze. They were also a great way to wind down a long day.All in all the week in San Francisco was a success in terms of making the right connections and I would highly recommend Game Connection as a place to go to meet fellow industry professionals who are looking to do business. GDC is also great but the setting is different, it is a lot more hectic with a lot of people there just to see whats new in the industry and what people are making. It is exciting and everyone you see is approachable so it has those benefits but if you have a game and are looking for a publisher, or you are looking for some middleware solutions for your games, or even a publisher looking for games then I’d highly recommend Game Connection. Or do what we did and do both.Until next time.Jamie “The All Spark” O’ FlanaganI wish I could join you in the conference like that. I am social gaming addict not only addictive to the games. I also love to read and search about social gaming industry!Social and Mobile Games\"There is no way we would have been able to meet our launch date trying to roll our own servers and build this functionality ourselves, so we are very grateful to have a partner in developing World War Toons as professional and supportive as Gamesparks\"\"GameSparks saved us a lot of time and provided us with great service and support. We love GameSparks and are sticking with it going forward.\"\"We see GameSparks as an extension to our own internal backend. It offers us rich social features that have been well developed and scale to our needs.\"\" No GameSparks. No Game! We succeeded in shipping WinterForts, to massive volumes of players online, all thanks to GameSparks’ invaluable product and support.\"\"After evaluating every potential backend service provider, we decided to go ahead with GameSparks. They support more Unity3D platforms than any other provider and their database manager, events system and test harness are extremely powerful and flexible to work with, on top of all the other great features they offer in their easy-to-integrate API.\"\"I’ve looked into Google App Engine, Parse, PlayFab, and now GameSparks. I’ve got to say that GameSparks is easily the best of the bunch for games. Plus, features like the Test Harness and SnapShots are a big selling point for me.”“After researching different highly-scalable backend solutions, GameSparks was the clear winner. The platform offers everything we were looking for including an excellent suite of tools for development and testing. Flexibility, rapid iteration and stability are key to us and the team at GameSparks really understands this. Highly recommended.”“From enabling a “preview” area of your services so you can test new features, to the number of service integrations they have out of the box, to their brilliant Cloud Code feature, the GameSparks platform is incredibly comprehensive for what you want in a game backend.”",

      "Tom Hooper aka Atomp, (04-12-13)I got in on Delver fairly early and at that point it was an interesting concept with a great deal of promise.  The skeptic in me expected it to continue much as is, but I was wrong. I came back to Delver a short while ago, but only really got back into it for this review and boy was I pleasantly surprised.Delver is a rogue-like, however it is more rogue-like than the vast majority of modern ‘rogue-likes.’ The game is essentially a first person action perspective of the classic rogue-like game, such as Nethack and the like. This is a great combination, taking established dungeoneering, leveling, fighting and loot mechanics and giving them an action orientated twist. This is a dungeon-crawler without the crawling.The gameplay is from a first person perspective, taking an action feel not dissimilar to the likes of Skryim and other first person fantasy games. The magic is done through the use of expendable wands, archery is much like Minecraft archery and blade combat is a click-to-swing affair. The combat is fast paced and hectic, switching weapons and doing so quickly is going to be pretty key in surviving. The game design is based around this with the player making tough choices as to what to keep in that hotbar on the top, because fumbling in the inventory screen is going to get you killed. The inventory itself is a very limited affair in how much you can carry, forcing some tough choices on the player. What you carry, what you equip and what you keep for later are all going to be essential decisions, often made quickly. The levels themselves are a reasonable size, but not excessive. Navigating is made possible through the use of both a map and a mini-map; both are really nice to see and well implemented. There is variety in the levels, with typically no more than 2 or 3 levels retaining the same theme. In fact, there is a good amount of variety in most elements of the game. The weapon variety is very good, with multiple types of swords, daggers, wands and bows in various states of repair. Armour is much the same, with the condition system mixing up what might otherwise have been a fairly linear progression. Enemy variety is also present, with some enemies recurring at higher levels and many appearing uniquely at certain levels or in certain dungeon themes.Leveling up will provide a skill point that can be placed into one of six categories, allowing the player to essentially construct the build that they prefer. There’s no respeccing, so your decision will be pretty much final for that particular character. The variety in skills really allows the player to make whatever build they want.  I personally had a lot of fun with an almost pure speed and agility leveled character. There’s a certain elegance to the simplicity of the skill system, with no complicated and convoluted skill trees and the like.  Instead it’s boiled down to the essentials, which is perfectly suited to the game. It is, of course, a rogue-like so your character is expected to die.  However, there is a degree of continuity after death, as gold earned by your previous character carries over to your next, allowing you to buy some essentials from the trader or mage at the starting camp before you enter the dungeon. This is a really nice game mechanic and aids the player in having some form of progression in what would otherwise be a straight reset on character death.Aesthetically, Delver has changed significantly since I played the early version. The PC version has been updated graphically and it looks fantastic, just the right side of retro but not excessively pixelated as it used to be. The early version that I initially played, similar to what the Android version is now, was perhaps a little bit too pixelated and the experience felt too claustrophobic and ill defined visually. With the latest texture update, that has changed and the sense of claustrophobia is just right. If you want something a little more high definition, there is a texture pack available from PureDBCraft which gives Delver a high quality comic-style appearance very reminiscent of PureDBCraft’s Sphax Minecraft texture pack. This texture pack will put you back a couple of quid (a few dollars), but it’s well worth it in giving the game yet another visual overhaul, especially tempting if you’re a fan of the Sphax Minecraft pack. The sound design has also come leaps and bounds since my initial experience, with the combat and action sounds complementing an amazingly atmospheric soundtrack. On the subject of sound, I would absolutely like to point out a little touch that is the icing on the cake: In the camp, around  the campfire next to the merchants, is a bard playing the guitar in a style very reminiscent of Stalker. This is a little thing but it’s so brilliant a touch in building atmosphere in the camp and bringing forward memories of time spent huddled around campfires for Stalker veterans.Beyond all the technical elements that make Delver great, I really want to emphasize exactly how it *feels* to play: It feels great. The entire experience now is of a game that is coming into its own, where the gameplay is fast, yet balanced, and the overall emmersive effect of all of the changes is reaching real polish. Dungeon crawling has a long history in various forms and rarely has it felt this emmersive, atmospheric and fun.Delver is available on Steam but, as always, I would recommend picking it up from the website through the Humble Store widget. This will provide DRM free copies on PC, Mac, Linux and Android and also includes a Steam activation. There is a distinct advantage for Android users in this approach, as it allows them to have the Android version bundled where they would otherwise have to use the Play store in addition to Steam. It is worth noting that the Android version seems to be behind on updates, so if you’re looking for a pure Android experience it may be a short while before the latest updates hit that platform. Currently, through the Humble Store widget on the game page, the price is $7.99 (approx £4.88) which is a good price considering you’ll get all four platforms for this and DRM free. On Steam the game will cost you $9.80 (approx £5.99) and on the Google Play store the Android version costs $2.11 (approx £1.29). The Play version is the cheapest of the lot, but also the last to get updates, so again I would recommend the Humble Store widget. System requirements are minimal and the game will run on most machines just fine.Game Page (with Humble Widget)Steam PageGoogle Play PagePureDBCraft Texture Pack",

      "A toolkit for innovators, rule-breakers and changemakersObject of PlayOften in projects, the learning is all at the wrong end. Usually after things have already gone horribly wrong or off-track, members of the team gather in a “postmortem” to sagely reflect on what bad assumptions and courses of action added up to disaster. What makes this doubly unfortunate is that those same team members, somewhere in their collective experience, may have seen it coming.A pre-mortem is a way to open a space in a project at its inception to directly address its risks. Unlike a more formal risk analysis, the pre-mortem asks team members to directly tap into their experience and intuition, at a time when it is needed most, and is potentially the most useful.Number of PlayersAny, but typically small teams will have the most open dialogueDuration of PlayDepends on the scope of an effort; allow up to five minutes for each participantHow to PlayA pre-mortem is best conducted at the project’s kickoff, with all key team members present and after the goals and plan have been laid out and understood. The exercise starts with a simple question: “What will go wrong?” though it may be elevated in phrasing to “How will this end in disaster?”This is an opportunity for the team to reflect on their collective experience and directlyname risks or elephants lurking in the room. It’s a chance to voice concerns that mightotherwise go unaddressed until it’s too late. A simple discussion may be enough to surfacethese items among a small team; in a larger group, Post-Up or list generation maybe needed.To close the exercise, the list of concerns and risks may be ranked or voted on to determine priority. The group then decides what actions need to be taken to address these risks; they may bring these up as a part of ongoing meetings as the project progresses.StrategyConducting a pre-mortem is deceptively simple. At the beginning of a project, the forward momentum and enthusiasm are often at their highest; these conditions do not naturally lend themselves to sharing notions of failure. By conducting a pre-mortem, a group deliberately creates a space to share their past learning, at a time when they can best act on it.The source of  the Pre-Mortem game is unknown.

      "The founder of up-and-coming review aggregator OpenCritic has accused rivals Metacritic of using the site’s data without permission.I wonder what scores our list of upcoming PC games will average out at.In a press release sent out today, founderMatthew Enthoven said, “We didn’t know if we should be proud or outraged when we took a look at Metacritic this morning and saw that they had OpenCritic’s review data and information on their site.“On the positive side, we were excited to see another industry giant stand alongside companies such as Insomniac Games, Nvidia and Telltale in presenting OpenCritic as an authority. However, we’re frustrated that we did not receive recognition and have requested that they either credit OpenCritic or begin licensing our API and databases.”Basically, OpenCritic seem to have found a way to more efficiently grab the review data to fill up the site once an embargo lifts. According to Enthoven, Metacritic are just swiping at least some of this data from them, rather than sourcing it from the outlets themselves, without crediting them.“If you can’t see how they copied us, we wouldn’t blame you – we make subtle, near-invisible changes to various review data to tag it using a system we call ‘horsemen’, Enthoven explained. “For example, with PCGamer’s Blood and Wine review, we added a redundant slash after pcgamer.com. With Twinfinite’s review, we capitalized the “W” and “B” in the review URL.“We can’t detail every example as it would give away our tells, but these two are notable: Metacritic’s Blood and Wine page currently has these exact horsemen listed, leading us to believe that they’ve begun sourcing reviews from OpenCritic. These changes don’t interfere with the user experience and are unique to OpenCritic. We checked to make sure that these links did not appear on popular websites such as Neogaf and reddit. We also feel confident in claiming that we listed these URLs first. As with most games, OpenCritic was faster: in this case, three hours faster.”The ‘horsemen’ were built into the system to protect the site’s work, in the same way old cartographers would add fake place to maps and phone books would leave in fake numbers – it’s like a fingerprint for their work, basically.I really like OpenCritic’s setup, as it doesn’t alter scores because they’re not on the /10 scale and it actually credits the critics, going as far as having a page for each one. Mine even has my face on it, it’s great.As Enthoven puts it: “We’re the only aggregator that correctly credits authors in addition to publications. We’re the only aggregator that lets users pick-and-choose their trusted publications. And unlike Metacritic, all of our scores are presented as simple averages with no hidden weightings, using data that can be verified by the public.“As we announced last January, our API alpha is in full swing and will soon shift into beta. We hope that Metacritic and others will consider joining our beta and licensing our API.”I emailed Enthoven to see what the company plans to do about the current situation, to which he responded: “We don’t intend to proceed beyond this statement and the letter that we’ve sent to [Metacritic owners] CBS Interactive. The legal precedents are not in our favor, nor would we want to engage in any legal proceedings. We can think of no faster way to drain funds and lose momentum.“Our intent here was to send a strong message to Metacritic that we are a serious competitor and that we will continue to call them out on practices that don’t advance the industry overall, including sourcing from us without credit.”ShareClicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.PromotedHow to master Monster Hunter: World’s deep combat system7 reasons you should return to RuneScape and Old School RuneScapeWhy a visit to Monster Hunter: World should be your videogame summer vacation",

An astounding trailer gave me no reason to believe otherwise. Now, I have finished the game, and I stand before you a broken man, wishing that I had a can of whitewash in my hand, and the will to use it. But try as I may, as badly as I want every adventure game to sell a million copies and my reviews to make that difference, I can not recommend Post Mortem to you.Let me start by assuring you of one thing: Post Mortem is a beautiful game, an extraordinary visual triumph as good-looking as Syberia. Incredible cut-scenes, amazing facial detail, and generally well-drawn and eye-pleasing backgrounds. If nothing else, Microids has solidified their reputation as having one of the strongest art teams in modern gaming.The game also succeeds, albeit with a few hiccups, in the area that first attracted me: the story. It begins as a relatively simple private-eye mysterious-woman murder mystery, and after a few fairly interesting twists and turns, we've got our hero Gus MacPherson digging into the history of Baphomet and the Templars...hmmm, where have I heard that before? Don't worry, there's nothing derivative about the plot, Microids was careful to not copy that other Templars game whose name escapes me. The story is surprisingly ambitious, not content to be as unsubstantial as most adventures are. Still, it's hardly groundbreaking; Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes (now ten years aged, still revolutionary) has a much more complex and involved plot. Still, the story is above average, properly paced, and leads up to a satisfying resolution (actually, there are three substantially different endings).Here, sadly, is where we run into the problems; even the greatest story ever can be told incompetently. I've read a few other Post Mortem reviews (which I generally try to avoid doing before writing a review) just to see what other writers were saying about the game's dialogue. The strongest wording I could find was \"the dialogue could use a bit more zip.\" Let me put it in the strongest terms I can think of: the dialogue in Post Mortem is absolutely, positively awful. Ghastly, dreadful, cringe-inducing...I'm still not sure I'm getting the message across. After ten minutes of pondering, I can't think of any reason not to say that, at least as high-profile commercial adventures are concerned, Post Mortem has the worst dialogue I've ever suffered through.Part of the problem clearly comes from the fact that the game was translated into English by non-native English speakers. How anyone ever thought this was okay is just beyond me, but there it is. Mysteriously, all contractions have been removed from the translation, so we end up with questions like \"Do not you realize?\" and \"Was not he already here?\" and similar perplexing abuses of an innocent language. The voice actors, who generally give uninterested performances (especially the voice of Gus, who apparently phoned his performance in from the comfort of his bed before going back to sleep), have the good sense to at least read the lines as \"don't\" and \"wasn't,\" but seeing different lines on screen than I'm hearing doesn't make me think much higher of the production job. That's beyond the occasional sentence where the first letter isn't capitalized, punctuation misplacements...this is not what gamers pay money for.It's not just the dialogue that's righteously flawed, it's the entire character interaction system. The dialogue tree system is a nightmare; only one option is shown on the screen at a time (you click on tabs to select others, and then often forget where the one you wanted in the first place is) and dialogue options appear and disappear with no logical connection to the conversation that is taking place. I found it fascinating that I could actually witness the death of one character, and then go to another character and all of a sudden have the dialogue option to ask about the whereabouts of the now-dead character, where I couldn't before. I can't imagine how any reasonable amount of beta testing couldn't have trapped these numerous logic bugs. The game logs all your conversations automatically, a very useful feature, but unfortunately a tragically humorous one as I was able to replay the insanely illogical discussions I was allowed to have with NPCs. The game could have done more to ensure the feasability of conversations if you were not forced to choose every sentence Gus says from a large group of choices, providing you with the means to undermine the flow of any conversation. It's also quite frustrating that there is no way to skip a line of dialogue that you've already heard before. There is, truly, not a single positive element in the character interaction system, and so what we end up with is a very decent story, painfully told.I have no complaints about the interface, familiar to those who have played Amerzone or Road to India, but I can assure you this would have been a more engrossing game in third-person; all the limitations and frustrations of a first-person navigation system are on full display here. The story is often impeded by the barrage of Myst-style puzzles, which are fairly tolerable and reasonably challenging, but just unnecessary at times. People complain about what an easy game Syberia was; is frustration and confusion for an extra hour of playing time really a wise trade?Post Mortem looks great, and I mean great, probably the best cut-scenes I've ever seen. It attempts to tell an intriguing above-average story. Those elements allow me to feel comfortable giving the game two stars. Everything just falls all to pieces in the execution, specifically every element of character interaction (which is 80% of the game). It's frustrating to the point of bafflement at times, to want to care so much about the story, but feel so stifled by the atrocious dialogue and unfriendly interaction system.I so badly want Microids to be successful. They have committed their support to the adventure genre. I would like nothing more than to help their cause by telling everyone to go buy their adventures. I can do that with Syberia, a truly remarkable adventure. But as much as I'd like to see every adventure succeed, the forseeable consequences are far worse if companies start to believe they can produce this sort of product without responsible reviewers informing the fans. There's no reason to give up on this company; the elements of a good game are here, and I have no reason to believe that Microids is not capable of producing a brilliant, well-executed Sherlock-esque detective adventure game, with engrossing dialogue, absorbing characters, and an uninhibited complex story. Post Mortem is most definitely not that game.Post Mortem is available at:Unconscious and near death in a makeshift boat, Kate Walker, the lawyer from New York, is miraculously discovered by a caravan of Youkol before she draws her last breath.

      "Tower of Guns is a roguelike single-player first-person shooter video game developed by Terrible Posture Games. It features levels that are randomly created from a pool of possible elements, making each playthrough unique.The game was officially released on March 4, 2014 to generally positive reviews.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nTower of Guns is a first-person shooter that takes place in a tower filled with a variety of guns. The player must ascend the tower by advancing through a series of randomized areas. Each area contains a number of arenas and a boss fight that the player must clear to advance. At the beginning of every run, one of several \"stories\" is selected at random, ranging from a soldier ordered by his superiors to climb the Tower of Guns, to a gun-toting barbarian guide protecting an evil priest on his way to a dark ritual at the top of the tower, to an \"inebriated scholar\" trying to get to a friend's home who has confused the Tower of Guns for his friend's apartment building. Aside from on-screen text appearing at the beginning and ending of every level, these stories do not impact the gameplay in any significant way, and can in fact be toggled off completely at the beginning of a run.\nAt the outset of a run, the player may choose one gun and one perk before they enter the Tower of Guns. The tower is filled with randomly placed robots and sentry turrets that fire projectiles at the player. These projectiles can produce a variety of effects, such as area of effect damage, fire damage, or launching the player into the air. When an enemy is destroyed, blue tokens are produced that the player can pick up to increase their gun's level. The tower also contains various power-ups that alter gameplay and upgradable guns that the player can unlock.The game is intended to be completed within one to two hours, and has been described as a \"lunch-break experience.\"\n\n\n== Development ==\nJoe Mirabello, the founder and sole member of Terrible Posture Games, began production on Tower of Guns after the collapse of 38 Studios, where he had been working on Project Copernicus, an unreleased massively multiplayer online game based on Kingdoms of Amalur. Mirabello said that \"after working on a game with hundreds of people made for thousands of people, I wanted to work on a single-player game made by just one person.\" A pre-alpha version of the game debuted at IndieCade booth at the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo.The completed build of the game was released on March 4, 2014 through a number of online clients, including Steam, GOG.com, GamersGate and IndieGameStand.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game received positive reviews upon release, garnering a score of 78 out of 100 on the review aggregation website Metacritic.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTower of Guns official website",

      "Tower of Guns is unique both in its gameplay and style. It’s a frantic shooter that keeps players on their toes throughout its entirety. However, the game’s few follies keep it from being a truly great arcade experience and instead leave it as a mediocre option for those gamers who love shooting things and need a break from current triple-A titles.Tower of Guns was first released on PC last year and received a warm welcome from players and the Xbox One and PS4 versions are direct ports from the PC version. The concept is a very simple shooter that pits players against rooms filled with turrets that shoot endlessly as the players make their way through a 14-floor tower.Tower of Guns‘ unique offering comes in the form of constantly changing rooms and randomized enemies. Each time a player starts a new game, they are greeted by new room formations and varying types of enemies. This was a definite bonus considering the game makes use of permadeath – starting players over from the beginning each time they die.Having randomly generated enemies and rooms helps keep the game interesting and challenging, as players can’t simply memorize how to beat each floor and move on. Rather, each playthrough is a unique experience that forces players to alter and update their play style as they progress through the levels. This keeps the game fresh for those who enjoy its hectic and frenzied gameplay.As players work their way through the levels, they may discover it’s best to methodically destroy every enemy in some rooms, and sprint through others without firing a shot. However, the game definitely rewards those who spend time shooting down enemies as they go along. All the bosses and many of the tough opponents drop various items and upgrades that players can use as they progress through the levels. Additionally, each time a player destroys a turret or flying bad guy, the enemy drops red and blue orbs that increase the player’s health and gun level respectively.Tower of Guns‘ upgrade method provides a fun an interesting twist on shooting games, as it rewards players who destroy enemies, but also punishes them for trying to run-and-gun too aggressively. Each blue orb fills a bar that shows how close the player is to upgrading their weapon. When the bar is full the gun upgrades, making it more powerful for the next set of enemies. However, that bar can lose energy when the player gets hit with enemy bullets, causing the gun’s level – and power – to decrease. While this may not be that noticeable in early rooms, it has a major effect as players work their way up the floors.The gun options are sparse, but provide differing experiences based on how players prefer to approach the tower. There are machine guns, spread-shot weapons and even a contraption that fires saw blades. While no one gun is universally better than any other, players will surely have a favorite go-to weapon based on their play style.This same sentiment goes for the perks players can choose at the beginning of each new game. Each perk offers players a small benefit that can greatly enhance their abilities while in the tower. These perks include options to triple-jump from the start, no falling damage, lower difficulty, and higher health.Graphically, Tower of Guns looks great and runs smoothly. Its semi cel-shaded nature gives it a very Borderlands feel, while not being a blatant ripoff. It helps keep the game visually appealing without requiring intricate visual details. Weapon firing, explosions, and environment movement all look good and add to the game’s quick pace and simple nature.When it comes to sound, the constant shooting from the player and enemies drowns the experience in a muffled chain of gunshots and explosions. While this should add to the game’s frantic feel, it actually does more to annoy players through its perpetual noise. It’s enough to make players appreciate the peace and quiet between rooms, which is counter-intuitive to the experience.The game’s simplicity makes it both fun and frustrating as an arcade game. On one hand, players have very few options for guns and perks as they enter the tower, so it’s easy to determine how to run the levels based on the player’s personal play style. On the other hand, the game lacks a certain depth that would help it be a more enjoyable and challenging experience.For instance, Tower of Guns seems to lend itself well to a multiplayer experience; however, there is no multiplayer option available. This seems like a serious oversight from developer Terrible Posture Games. Even opening the game to a two-person co-op mode where friends can run the levels together would be a great addition to the game, and would definitely be effective in bringing players back to the tower. In fact, the randomized nature of the levels would make this one of the best multiplayer arcade experiences currently available for consoles.Unfortunately, players are left to tackle the tower levels themselves over and over again. And despite the randomized nature of the levels, the incessant barrage of fire from enemies can get frustrating and old fairly quickly.Additionally, although the game tries to keep things simple with small rooms filled with randomized enemies, the incessant enemy attacks begin to feel very similar all too quickly. This keeps the game from feeling like a new experience every time, but rather the same experience in just a different location. Ultimately, every level is the same concept with just different surroundings.While the permadeath is reminiscent of classic arcade games and more recent rogue-likes, it brings with it a certain amount of frustration that has the power to keep players from wanting to jump back in after they die. This is especially true when players have made it to the mid to high levels of the tower. It would be nice to see Terrible Posture Games incorporate some kind of save feature, or even create a game mode that allows players to restart where they died and continue their progress. But of course that’s not the game’s M.O. and plenty will appreciate that.In the end, Tower of Guns does have an element of fun thanks to its randomized levels and simple premise, but it’s a game best consumed a little at a time. While a few gamers may enjoy the game enough to play it often, most will see Tower of Guns as a momentary distraction to be experienced for a few minutes, then left to wait for a later date. As Terrible Posture Games expands the games and hopefully adds a multiplayer option, Tower of Guns will become a staple arcade game for current-gen consoles. Until then, it remains a frenzied shooter that’s sure to both annoy and please those who appreciate the challenge.Tower of Guns is currently available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

      "What’s your favourite tower? Is it Tower Bridge? Maybe it’s Leonard Cohen’s “Tower of Song”? Those are incorrect answers; one’s a bridge and the other is a song. It could be Tower of Guns, although please note that this is not an actual tower made out of guns.It is a tower though, and there are definitely guns involved. Most of them are automated, mechanised and pointing at whichever body part you consider to be your tenderest. If only there were some method of fighting back at your disposal. Oh wait, there is! Using other, different guns.Tower of Guns comes from Terrible Posture Games, a collective term for creator Joe Mirabello and brother Mike Mirabello (who contributed some splendid music.) It’s a game that does something I’ve not really seen before, but when I tell you what that is you’ll probably say “wow, seriously, why isn’t EA putting out annual versions of that?”First-Person Shooter plus Roguelike.At this point somebody out there is probably forming the sentence “well actually, Paranautical Activity …” I know. I know there are a couple of others. But how many of them have a story where you’re a cowgirl surviving a zombie apocalypse AND a semi-sentient pile of goo conversing with your puppy-loving creator AND a pissed-up scholar looking for his friend’s apartment building? Not nearly enough of them, says I.It may seem counter intuitive to praise the story in a game where 99.7% of your activities involve making things explode and avoiding that fate yourself, especially when there’s even an option to turn it off entirely, but it’s a point of focus for Tower of Guns’ friendly charm. Too many games end up with cloying whimsy when they try this stuff. Here, the tone seems genuine and effortless (a sure sign that it actually took a fair bit of effort.)You get a different tale every time you restart, though repeats will begin to creep in around your tenth attempt. It’s a loose framework around which to hang the reason for your escapades, but like a good short story each one sketches just enough detail to serve its purpose.The charm doesn’t end at these text-based narratives, either. Tower of Guns is a charismatic game full of bold colours and gigantic, absurd cannon devices that fire slow-moving shells as big as your entire body. At times it seems as if it’s one step away from putting grinning faces on them and going full Looney Tunes. The game creates a likeable space, one you’ll want to spend time in despite the obvious and inherent dangers.That’s important, because you’ll be revisiting the same levels a fair bit. Tower of Guns has a pool of rooms that it draws from for each stage, but you’ll start to recognise (in either delight or horror) certain sections after you’ve put a couple of hours into it. However, your progression towards the tower’s summit won’t always take you through the same levels; sometimes you’ll pass through the warehouse, other times you might see the battlements.Wherever you go, bullets will follow. If the images dotted around this review didn’t already inform you: Tower of Guns likes to flood the screen with projectiles and enemies. Pray that you played at least one shooter in the mid 90s because, while it doesn’t quite handle the same, this title will be a refresher course for those skills. It’s Circle Strafe: The Roguelike Experience. Keep moving. Keep circle-strafing. Stay alive (mostly.)Like those games of yesteryear, there are secrets to be found in obscure locations. I’m talking “this part of the wall looks identical to the others, oh wait it’s transparent and there’s stuff behind” obscure. Most of the time you only carry one weapon (chosen at the start,) but it’s possible to find outlandish secondaries in hidden levels or locations.The Roguelike aspect isn’t just restricted to repeating, randomised levels and regular death. It’s also present in the perk system and the kind of pick-ups you can grab on each attempt to scale the tower. At the start of the game you can only opt for a triple-jump ability or the negation of fall damage, but as you progress and achieve various feats of heroism (or fragility) more perks become available. Things like increased speed for an armour trade-off, or the “Too Young To Die” easy mode (unlocked after a damage threshold has been reached) which gives you a huge advantage against basically everything.New guns unlock in much the same way. You start off with a pair of slightly rubbish ones, and end up with access to rat-a-tat laser rifles and a hand cannon that can compete with your foes in the comedy oversized shell stakes. Blowing up enemies makes them scatter delicious collectable items all over the floor, including blue shards that can power your weapon up to more impressive levels. Taking damage will reduce that power level, so there’s an incentive to stop and destroy things rather than just attempting to duck and weave masterfully through every location. Especially since each level ends with an imposing boss encounter.Problem is, the guns feel a bit wimpy. I’m not someone who has any interest in weapon authenticity, and intense talk about the FEEL and IMPACT of guns in games honestly gets a bit disturbing. But even I can tell that the plop-plop of bullets against enemies who flash for a bit and then vanish with a canned explosion is a bit dissatisfying. While dancing around enemy bullets is intense, besting them with your own firepower doesn’t feel as triumphant as it should.Player mobility also feels a little off to me. Tower of Guns evokes so much from mid 90s shooters, that you’d image it would move in a similar way too. That’s not really the case, because while the player can’t really jump all that high (at first) doing so will leave you hanging, drifting in the air. This is useful for mid-air changes of direction if you’re needing to float your way down to a point of safety, but sometimes feels restrictive for bullet-ducking purposes. Unless, that is, you come across a few speed and jumping badge power-ups on your run. Then it’ll get that Quake-nostalgia flowing.It doesn’t have the wealth of items, levels and special powers of something like The Binding of Isaac, but thanks to its rapid pace Tower of Guns does tug at that same urge to dive straight back into a new game. The FPS-plus-Roguelike-like-(like?) concept is strong and, while the projectile play doesn’t feel as weighty as it should, the title will remain enticing as long as the player can maintain the desire to circle-strafe. It’s a likeable game, and disposable in the best possible connotations of that term.Contact PC Invasion Advertising About PC Invasion Staff Jobs Privacy PolicySteam Facebook Twitter RSSHave you got PC gaming news you want to share with PC Invasion?

      "How many bullets can we fit onto a single computer screen? We're sure that's what Joe Mirabello, the man behind Terrible Posture Games and the creator of Tower of Guns, must have asked himself before embarking on the project. We picture a breakfast table, where he sits contemplating the great mysteries of life over a cup of coffee. Why are we here, what is the meaning of life and how difficult can a videogame be while still remaining fun to play?Tower of Guns is an exercise in patience, fortitude and old school twitch reflexes. It's an arcade game with an endless supply of enemies and a single goal, get to the top of the tower. The game experience is highly concentrated and according to the developer it shouldn't take more than an hour or two to complete it, if you've got what it takes. Tower of Guns is difficult. Not hard like playing the latest AAA game on the hardest difficulty setting, we're talking old old school tough. Mega Man and Quake difficult. So let this be your warning, Tower of Guns is not for everyone.If you expect a certain amount of progress in a game you will be sorely disappointed. Most likely your first five or six runs in Tower of Guns will take place in the first two levels, the easy ones. You'll die a lot and upgrades and new weapons will be few and far between. Even when you manage to unlock something new the game doesn't become any easier, so to progress you just have to grit your teeth and man up.Luckily the game is generated anew each time you restart, so you never know which enemies, which rooms or which bosses you'll encounter on each level of the tower. The game rewards fast reflexes and the ability to master old tactics like circle-strafing and bunny jumping. Even so it doesn't take much to kill you and an element of dumb luck is essential to get as high up in the tower as possible.Almost everything in the game is made by Joe Mirabello himself and Tower of Guns is very much the quintessential indie game. It looks incredible with a visual style that lands somewhere between Borderlands and Ratchet & Clank. The music sets the tone well and keeps the pace up. The level design is relatively straightforward with ample room to move around and use the environment to dodge bullets. The tower is divided into rooms and each one supplies a new challenge, with only a moment between each one to catch your breath. The doors are opened by shooting them, just like in real life!There's little context for what takes place in Tower of Guns, but every time you start a new play-through you're treated to a new twist on what passes for story in the game. Each time some form of narrator asks you to shoot everything in sight and get to the top of the tower. It's hard to explain but it definitely makes the game a lot more fun to play.Aside from being both fun and challenging, Tower of Guns can also be terribly frustrating. We don't mind games that are repetitive or that force the player to play it several times to unlock new features. What bothers us the most is the lack of forward momentum in the game. You are never told how far up in the tower you got, or how far you had left until the top. When you die there's a statistic of how well you did with information such as your kill count. The thing that is presented in the boldest and most visible font, however, is how many times you've died in Tower of Guns and that doesn't really motivate me to play another ten times to unlock a new perk or gun.We respect developers who leave large studios to do their own thing, who defy economic difficulties to publish the game of their dreams, the one they want to play but no one else in the game industry wants to make. We tip our hats to Joe Mirabello for what he's accomplished in Tower of Guns, but sadly we won't be playing much of it in the future - torturous difficulties aren't everybody's cup of tea.6 / 10 Gamereactor Sweden7 / 10 Gamereactor Italy\n\n7 / 10 Gamereactor Spain\n\n7 / 10 Gamereactor Germany\n\n7 / 10 Gamereactor Finland\n\n7 / 10 Gamereactor Norway\n\n7 / 10 Gamereactor Denmark",
      "When anybody copies anything, whether it be yesterday's homework or a triple-A video game, that person or company is usually slammed for doing so. Unusually, though, that's not the case for Fortnite, as the game wears almost all of its influences on its sleeve despite still continuing to dominate the market.Now, with Fortnite's new season making its debut and once again inducing a freakout amongst most of the gaming community, it's safe to say that Fortnite might go down as one of the most popular games of all time. But for a while, I thought the light we see Fortnite in would be somewhere I'd see PUBG one day.When PUBG dropped, it gave us the best take of the battle royale formula and the game seemed to be growing by the second. But it was held back by poor performance issues and terrible optimization, only giving a “good” experience for PC owners with great graphics cards. And it only got worse for PUBG when they released maybe one of the worst console ports ever.Suffice to say that Fortnite had ample opportunities to capitalize and become THE battle royale of today. But instead of giving us an entirely brand new take on the battle royale genre, Fortnite really boiled down to a PUBG/Minecraft clone. It may be an undoubtedly fun game, but we're going to call a spade a spade, and today we're going to go through all the things Fortnite has ripped off.Yes, we know, just like The Hunger Games, PUBG didn’t invent the battle royale formula, so many might say that it doesn’t matter that Fortnite ripped this particular thing off. Buuuut, just as The Hunger Games popularized battle royale in movies, PUBG was responsible for popularizing this formula in video games.Fortnite also did a good job of copying the exact style of PUBG’s battle royale, but we’ll get into that later.PUBG didn’t invent battle royale, but they still deserve a ton of credit for making it what it is today. Sorry Fortnite fans, this one was a shameless rip-off.Now that we’ve got some of the meat and potatoes out of the way, it’s time to dive into the finer details of how Fortnite rips off PUBG. Starting with one that particularly feels like a blatant rip-off, keeping the lobby sizes to 100.Sure, 100 feels like a great number, we celebrate it greater than most birthdays, Drake’s made a song on it, and heck, it even has an emoji.But Fortnite choosing this particular number just feels too on the nose to the game sizes in PUBG.Allow me to say that if you purchased PUBG in its early access form, you probably made your money back by selling tons of free skins for bloated prices on the Steam marketplace. But most people probably weren’t as fortunate, and not only had to pay for PUBG but also have to look at all the microtransactions as they play their game.Fortnite deserves a ton of credit for how they rolled out their game versus PUBG. Making Fortnite a free-to-play game validates the reasons for the affordable battle pass and all the other cosmetics that the game offers.Fortnite just didn’t take the high road when it came to shaping its battle royale mode. Instead of separating their mode from the competition like how GTA V did with their battle royale mode, they shamelessly and obviously ripped off features like player count, and game modes/variations.Most of the time in Fortnite you have the opportunity to play in squads, duos, or by yourself to take on the other meme dancing 6th graders you're probably playing against. Sounds an awful lot like PUBG, which offers the exact same game modes and variations.The Storm is an undoubtedly cool feature: you’re caved in on this island and are slowly being pushed towards the middle by this abundance of fog known as the Storm. Too bad the Storm is yet another feature that feels creative, yet is another rip off of PUBG’s blue circle.The blue circle in PUBG acts exactly as the Storm does, moving players towards the center but instead with damage dealt by an aura of blueness.Fortnite’s version is definitely the more memorable version, but it still counts as a rip-off.Not only does Fortnite do a better job of how they roll out their skins and costumes, but they also just have better cosmetics than PUBG. Fortnite’s skins have become iconic to the gaming industry ranging from tomato heads to full-on armors like the Omega outfit.While PUBG's cosmetics are pretty good too with outfits like the trench coat and now the new weapon skins. We just can’t help but feel like PUBG's skins are just stale in comparison to Fortnite.This is where PUBG’s infamous lawsuit against Epic Games and Fortnite comes into play. Both Fortnite and PUBG use the Unreal Engine, which might paint Fortnite as the robbers of yet another aspect, but, this situation gets a lot dicier when you realize the owner of that engine, Epic Games, also makes Fortnite. Yikes.Apparently, the lawsuit was fueled with resentment because Epic Games wasn’t completely cooperating with helping the PUBG devs in optimizing the engine for their games.Obviously Epic would have no reason to help out their competitors, but this whole situation just seems so shady that we don’t even know what to make of it.One thing you gotta give credit to Fortnite for is that they may wear their influences on their sleeves, but they do a dang good job at pimping out those ideas. Take the plane from PUBG for example: yet another thing that Fortnite has stolen and reimagined for their game.The Plane from PUBG gave players a unique and pretty cool way to start off games.Guess this was just yet another good idea that the Fortnite devs couldn’t live without; so add the battle bus to the list of the things of things that Fortnite has ripped off.PUBG, a more serious take on the battle royale formula, has no real place for things like taunts and dances. Sure, taunts are getting more and more popular in games, but they just don’t feel right in PUBG. I guess the devs didn’t care when they saw how popular they were in Fortnite.Fortnite dances and taunts have become a sensation, inspiring cringey yet occasionally funny videos across the internet. And I’m sure you’ve seen kids doing the dances from time to time. Sure, you want to shake your head out of moderate to severe disappointment, but you can’t deny this sensation.More of a minor nitpick, but those count too! The bush outfit is another staple from Fortnite, yet it’s pretty easy to spot similarities between the disguise and PUBG’s Ghillie suit.Once again we find Fortnite guilty of ripping off something and making it more playful for their game and their audiences.Both of these outfits are extremely rare to find in a game, but they both offer a coveted outfit that allows you to camouflage with the environment. Though it is admittedly more fun to watch someone stumble around as a bush in Fortnite.PUBG doesn’t get enough credit for what they’ve brought to the table for the battle royale genre, as their innovations span a wide range of features, including their lobby experience.PUBG was notorious for letting players mess around in the lobby before the match started, and Fortnite once again went ahead and ripped them off.Yes, yes, PUBG isn’t completely responsible for it as H1Z1 had this feature as well, but it still feels like Fortnite’s lobby is just a little too similar to it’s counterparts.PUBG truly lacks a real atmosphere/aesthetic, kind of like Call of Duty it just feels like a generic shooter. And sure, a generic shooter appeals to everyone because anyone can get into it, but it feels a whole heck of a lot better when a game has a distinct feel to it.Games like BioShock, Overwatch, Portal, GTA, and even Fortnite are popular for the atmosphere they bring to the table.Fortnite, a lot like Plants vs. Zombies or Overwatch, brings this cartoony vibe that makes it feel goofy and fun, maybe PUBG should take notes.Well, now that season 5 has officially rolled out in Fortnite, we can now call out the game for also ripping off vehicles from PUBG. Once again, it’s not like PUBG invented vehicles in a battle royale, but they seriously popularized it with how hilarious, and meme-y the vehicles were.And the hilariousness of the PUBG vehicles was definitely not intentional, as most of their comedic feel comes from the bugs we experience on them but I digress. In a way, Fortnite copied the aesthetic of the PUBG vehicles, and how much comedy they offer.Oh, you already know we’re getting deep into the dirt on this list to see what Fortnite rips off, and that plagiarism stems to the healing items. When it comes down to it, these items are literally just reskins of the healing items in PUBG.You have bandages (which are rip-offs), medkits (another rip-off) aaaaand slurp juice (which are just energy drinks in disguise).It’s nothing clever, and while the game does offer other healing options, the ones that we mentioned or really the premiere items.The items in PUBG are scaled on a three-level system. You have your level 1 items which are prominent but feeble, your level 2s which are also common but an upgrade over level 1s, and also your big boy level 3 items which are rare but incredibly good and durable.Enter Fortnite with a leveled item system that feels a bit too on the nose when compared to PUBG.Fortnite features a loot system that is ranked by color, ranging from the weak gray items to the golden mythical ones.Even though we just accused Fortnite of ripping off PUBG’s item system, we do have to say that the weapons and items themselves are a lot more interesting. Granted, you can’t get too crazy in a realistic-type shooter like PUBG, but they don’t have many weapons that just feel like a blast to use.On the other hand, Fortnite features some wonderfully creative weapons and items like the RPG, the grenade launcher, and the splendidly funky boogie bomb.PUBG has some fun weapons, especially the snipers, but none that feel out of the box.No I’m not crazy (at least I think), I know I mentioned cosmetics and apparel in the “Does Better” section, but this particular item is something that Fortnite rips off while simultaneously improving upon.PUBG was the first battle royale game that popularized skins, and to my knowledge, it was the first to have skins at all.The skins were selling like hotcakes when PUBG first hit the Steam store, and I’m seriously guessing that Fortnite and Epic Games took note of the success that PUBG found with skins.We really can’t give Fortnite too much flak for this one as most shooters fall into the category of being a 3rd person shooter or a first-person shooter... and something tells me that Fortnite wouldn’t have found success being a top-down shooter, but maybe that’s just me.Even with all that being said, PUBG started off as a primarily third-person shooter, and it’s still primarily played that way making this sort-of, kind-of another aspect that Fortnite ripped off. I don’t feel entirely good about this entry since this one is more of technicality, but it still counts as a rip-off.Fortnite does an incredible job at justifying their in-game purchases when compared to really any battle royale game. And it’s pretty obvious as to why: the game is free!Any game that is free automatically gets a lot more leeway when it comes to offering microtransactions.I mean, they got to make money someway. But Fortnite should also get credit for their innovative battle pass which is extremely affordable and still makes players feel like they are earning the skins instead of just easily and cheaply buying them.Now, this one didn’t even feel like a rip-off until I really thought long and hard about the gameplay between PUBG and Fortnite... but once it did come to mind, it was obvious to see it was a rip-off.PUBG features crate drops that come every once in a while and when they do come they drop ultra rare loot that is sure to give you an edge within your game.And once again, we can look at Fortnite to see a feature that is so on the nose to PUBG’s crate drops that we’re surprised they haven’t won the lawsuit already.Well, it’s not “technically” true as you start off a Fortnite game with your trusty pickaxe, it still should be stated that the start of these two games is eerily similar. For PUBG, after jumping from the plane (or Battle Bus if you're playing Fortnite) you move onto looting everywhere and anywhere.While we already got Fortnite for ripping off the plane from PUBG, they also do a good job of ripping off your initial moments in each game. Both games start you off with no loot and you're forced to find some good stuff as quick as possible.Fortnite does an exceptional job at making your battle royale experience feel like it’s adding up to some overall story, while PUBG kind of misses the mark here. Sure, it’s fun to have mindless fun on a multiplayer game like CS Go, Call of Duty, or Battlefield, but games like Overwatch and Fortnite nail the underlying story aspect.It almost makes me feel like Fortnite ripped off Overwatch’s underlying story on this one.The story can be ignored by anyone, but for those who pay attention to it, they’re given just another interesting, and fun aspect of the game.To be honest, this one could’ve easily made it onto the “does better” section as Fortnite really does do a great job with their map, but this one could go either way.The reasons for that or for the distinct location that is prominent in both default maps; basically we’re getting at the fact that they’re both on islands.Once again, it just feels like Fortnite hit this one a bit too on the nose, because instead of featuring their location in some deserted wasteland, or maybe some luscious forest, they went for an abandoned island, just like PUBG.Sure, I did mention that Fortnite has some cooler weapons than PUBG, but when it comes to their core weapon sets, they’re pretty much the exact same things.You got your assault rifles, your shotguns, your pistols, the list truly goes on and on.In Fortnite's case, you can point out a few distinct weapons that are radically different like the RPG and grenade launcher, but most of the weapons are pretty much the same. Granted, even the weapons that are exactly alike, like the Scar, act differently but from an aesthetic point, they’re exactly the same thing.Without a proper, quality progression system, you’ll find that a multiplayer game will slowly start to feel less interesting than any multiplayer game. Games like CS Go and Rocket League live off of their quality progression systems, and at this point you can definitely throw Fortnite into that mix.You know who doesn’t have a proper progression system and still has one that feels clunky? PUBG.PUBG just recently tacked on a progression system, making this an entry that feels like vice versa of what we’ve seen on this list.We kind of already mentioned this one, but really wanted to flesh it out more with this entry. Looting in most battle royale games follows the formula that PUBG has popularized so we have to include this in the “Ripped Off” section.PUBG scatters loot around the entire map, making every game feel like another scramble for who can get to the good stuff first.It’s a system that is fun almost every time, so it makes sense as to why Fortnite would be set up this way.Combat in PUBG sometimes, well, just feels awkward. A lot of that can just be blamed on the maps and how they’re constructed (up until the release of the newest map) but for most games, you are just walking around for minutes on end without seeing a single person.Some may like an experience like this, but the games feel a lot more intense when you have fights happening one after another. Fortnite’s map is set up perfectly for combat and now it feels like PUBG finally sought after that direction with their newest map.Here’s one that every PUBG fan likes to use against Fortnite when detailing how the game specifically rips PUBG off; we’re talking about the glider versus the parachute.It’s extremely petty of Fortnite to copy PUBG down to the last detail, but I guess here we are. Instead they could’ve chosen to just have their players slam down to the ground or maybe land on trampolines, but instead, they took the route that makes them look like blatant rip-offs.The skins for the gliders are undoubtedly cool, but rip-offs nonetheless.The quintessential reason why Fortnite is more popular than PUBG is that the game actually feels like a complete game. PUBG for the longest time felt like a buggy mess, even when it was ported to consoles.It felt like we were playing a broken mod that a few people created in their basement.But this was passed off as a full-fledged game, making it feel even more disrespectful to the people who dished out $30 dollars for it. The fact that the developers for PUBG had the gall to charge for their broken game is honestly extremely insulting.For battle royales, I always had this idea that there’d be at least one game that rewards you for coming in second, or even third place. Nope, time after time it’s only last man, or last team standing wins.It’s so much fun to be the last person or team to win, but it feels like this formula has been seriously overused. It’d be awesome to see a podium where the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd placers are celebrated, but Fortnite joins the ever-growing list of games to let only one man or team win a game.ThePremium grants you  UNLIMITED AD FREE ACCESS  accross our full Network!Have an account?

      "Jump to navigationPlatform: Playstation 4 (reviewed), Xbox OneBack in the early days of the first-person shooting genre, we weren't worried about story, or multiplayer perks, or even any given amount of substance. We were simply more concerned with taking on enemies using a variety of crazy weapons, while fighting to stay alive as long as humanly possible. Doom and Duke Nukem 3D were definitely strong examples of this type of game.So that's why it's refreshing to have a game like Tower of Guns exist. Terrible Posture Games' entry reminds us more of the classic shooter of old, foregoing story in favor of fast-paced run and gun action. It doesn't have the substantial features to make it a classic for the long haul, but its quick, kinetic set-up and progressive difficulty makes it worth the download.When you first start out in Tower of Guns, you'll begin with a pithy little pea shooter of a pistol, capable of dishing a decent amount of destruction, but not capable of doing that much in the long haul. That said, the game is built on a progressive scale so that your weapon powers up as you pick up blue orbs left behind by enemies. Oh, and you'll unlock new weapons as well.These additional arms provide you not only with power, but also innovation. After all, it's not often you get to use a pizza oven of doom, or an iron fist that acts like a shotgun, shooting bursts of fire at your enemies. They can power up as well, and once you clear level 5 with them, you'll really get to see what they're made of.If you survive that long, that is. Tower of Guns has a great difficulty setting where enemies get harder the further you get into the game, whether it's a large turret that fires bullets all over the place (along with a self-producing explosion that avoids close attacks) or buzzsaw-shooting automations that rarely miss. You'll be scampering about to survive, and while new-school tactics may not be so welcome here (all you have are your weapons, a triple jump and whatever perks you find), this game is all about the classic style of play.And that's what makes Tower work so well. While the lack of multiplayer is notable, the ever-changing levels give you a reason to go back for more, whether it's your first time in or your hundredth. There's also an abundance of hidden rooms to find, as well as secret goods and new weapons to unlock. So it's not like your pushing forward into the game will be for nothing.There are also little nuances of strategy that can be appreciated in Tower, whether it's using your triple jump to move around quicker, activating a perk to double your experience points or enhance your performance, or even using boosters to shoot yourself higher up into a stage. There's plenty to take in here, although you'll need every ounce of these skills if you want to make it to the final boss. For serious.While Tower of Guns isn't likely to be confused with the likes of Advanced Warfare or Battlefield Hardline, it definitely has an appealing old-school motif to its design. The game runs at a fluid frame rate and features a variety of levels that scatter each time you play, with everything from a large room filled with grinders to a boss battle lair, where spiked walls move around randomly as cannonballs are shot your way. It runs fluidly throughout, so you'll find little to complain about in the design department.As for sound, it's lacking a bit of character, but still suitable. The music is pretty good, and the sound effects are on the money with the booms and bangs, but there's very little character speaking, outside of the \"love robots\" that you can blast to bits if they annoy you too much. And even then, they're just approving groans.Still, there is something to be said about the in-game messages strewn throughout. Do they make sense? Hardly. But are they hilarious? Yep. It's almost like a story's being told in its own right with these, although you'll probably be too busy shooting to notice them all. If you can catch a glance, though, they're worth checking out.These are the criteria I consider most important for reviewing Tower of Guns.Graphics: 8/10Nothing revolutionary, but the visuals have an old-school vibe that's truly delightful.Sound: 7/10Pretty good music and sound effects, but some voicework would've added some personality.Gameplay: 8/10Vintage run and gun action, with hidden secrets, unlockable guns and other goodies to take advantage of.Replay Value: 7/10There's no multiplayer, and the game can be heinously difficult, but there's plenty to come back to.Overall: 7.5/10While Tower of Guns doesn't quite have the substance to be the Doom for this generation, it's still an effective throwback to a simpler time for shooters, and a game that fanatics of the genre shouldn't miss. Plus, it's challenging as heck, and some of the weapons featured in the game are a blast to use.

With random enemies, random power ups, random      bosses, tons of unlockable items and weapons... and even random-level      compositing - You never know what to expect! So grab a rocket-launcher, slap      a shotgun-modifier on it, pick up a hundred stackable 'double jumps' (or      centuple jumps at that point, I suppose) and get to conquering the Tower of      guns!           URL: http://[url=www.towerofguns.com][url=http://www.towerofguns.com[/url]]www.towerofguns.com[/url][/url]          ▄▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ ▓██ ▓▄  █ ▓██▀▀ ▀███▀ ▄██▀▄ ▓██   ▓██   ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▄     █▓                 ▓██ ▓██▄█  ▀██▄  ▓██  ▓██▄█ ▓██   ▓██                     █      ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀ ▀▀▀▀▀  ▀▀▀  ▀▀▀ ▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀       1.

Our games are made from physical sources if possible - like in      the good old times and how we think it should still be done. In our opinion      digital download versions should be tagged as such or at least it should be      noted in the nfo. Also we think that physical sources never could be dupes      of digital versions as well as CD versions are no dupes of DVD ones. All      old and still active scene rules proof that we are right (the new S.I.R      rules from 2009 and 2010 are not signed by any scene group and are not      active because of that).           We bring you games that other groups do not do. We are different, like us      or hate us. You think some games that we release are crap? We do not care      because we think that scene means that every game should be released.           To rise the quality of our releases we now try to make all our releases      both in normal image format (bin/cue or iso) as requested by the scene      rules and also in clone (Alcohol 120%) format.          ▄▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ ▄██▀▀ ▓██▀▄ ▓██▀▀ ▓██▀▀ ▀███▀ ▓██ ▓▄  █ ▄██▀▀ ▓██▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▄     █▓           ▓██ █ ▓██▄▀ ▓██▀  ▓██▀   ▓██  ▓██ ▓██▄█ ▓██ █  ▀██▄             █      ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀  ▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀  ▀▀▀  ▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀  ▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀          0x0815 - 0x0007 - FLT - GENESiS - GREENPEACE - PROPHET - DEFA - SMACKs                                      Razor1911 - RELOADED       \n\n\n\n \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t\t\n\n\nТоррент:\nЗарегистрирован [26 июн 2018, 16:59]\n\n \n\nСкачать торрент\n[ Размер 15.48 КБ / Просмотров 0 ]\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\n\n\nСтатус:\nПроверен \n\n\n.torrent скачан:\n232 раз\n\n\nРазмер:\n744.26 МБ  (780 408 579 байт) \n\n\n \r\n\t\t\t Стать Автором раздачи\n\n\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \n\n\n Вернуться к началу\n\nЦитата\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nОтветить\n\n\r\n\t\t\t1 сообщение\r\n\t\t\t • Страница 1 из 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nПохожие торренты\nОтветы\nПросмотры\nПоследнее сообщение\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTower Of Guns (Terrible Posture Games LLC ) (ENG) [RePack] от R.G.

      "Contact Us  About Us  Staff  Advertise With Us  Privacy Policy  Terms of Use  Reviews Policy  Hooked Gamers  Community PolicyPosted By Oliver VanDervoort | On 16th, Apr. 2015 Under Article, ReviewsWhen I first powered up Tower of Guns, I had to go back and look to see if Gearbox had made this particular game. The graphical look of the game, as well as the fact that a large part of the gameplay is based around really weird weapons made me think that if it wasn’t made by Gearbox, Tower of Guns was made by someone who had worked for the company or was trying out to be a part of the next Borderlands installment. That isn’t to say that Tower of Guns is really any kind of a ripoff of Borderlands 2. What it does say is that at least, this game is a bit of an homage that takes the first person shooter genre and the graphical representation of the game’s world and runs with it in its own direction.The first thing that sets Tower of Guns apart from anything Gearbox has put together is that this game has long been billed as a kind of “lunchbreak FPS.” Having said that, I had caught someone’s comment about what the game was before I managed to get my hands on it and I have to say that is pretty much a perfect descriptor. This isn’t a game that has a terribly immersive story mode. In fact, it doesn’t really have any kind of story mode at all, unless you view a story as “hey look, shoot that thing that’s in front of you.”\"The first thing that sets Tower of Guns apart from anything Gearbox has put together is that this game has long been billed as a kind of “lunchbreak FPS.”\"There is also a peripheral storyline that goes on while I was playing, in the form of text dialogue, though that storyline has no actual bearing on the game itself. Rather this seems to just be a little thing that is built in to bring the laughs. The one that pops up the first time I ran through the game was that of the developer actually telling me a few of the tips and tricks to get through the tower.Other storylines were of a pizza delivery guy who was trying to find his customer and another and perhaps the most guffaw inducing was when I was going reading a conversation between an apparent old couple that had gotten lost. As far as I can tell, there isn’t any rhyme or reason to the text dialogue and while it is sort of funny, I had to wonder why the developer didn’t put a little more into fleshing this out and making it a real story.It’s possible Tower of Guns was just never meant to be serious enough to need or want a real storyline in the game. This game seems to have been built for those who just want to be able to pick up the controller and shoot as many things as they possibly can. The premise of the actual game is that I had to either blast my way through, or dash my way through a number of different rooms, all with different “enemies”in the form of unmanned gun turrets and flying killing machines.\"It’s possible Tower of Guns was just never meant to be serious enough to need or want a real storyline in the game. This game seems to have been built for those who just want to be able to pick up the controller and shoot as many things as they possibly can.\"Tower of Guns combines elements from a number of other video game platforms in a way that makes it enjoyable if you are indeed just looking for something to spend the next 20 minutes with. Picking up and playing, without having to wait through a cut scene in order to know what you’re supposed to do is refreshing at times. As long as you’re not looking for an immersive world that will really draw you in. The game is roguelike in the notion that the rooms are randomly generated throughout the levels so when you have to start your run over, you aren’t guaranteed to know what you’re going to be facing off against.And you will have to start over a number of times. Tower of Guns isn’t an easy game by any stretch. The game tried to help me out by allowing me power ups if I killed enough enemies and collected the little blue lights that came pouring out of them after they blew up. The little red bulbs also replenished my health from time to time but the rooms aren’t big and the enemies are plentiful and I died far more often than I’m even willing to admit in my playthroughs.Clearly I wasn’t the only one to have this problem, considering one of the most important stats the game tracks is deaths. This is also where the game gets a bit repetitive, there aren’t a ton of different enemies and the ones that are there aren’t meant to ooh and ahh you with their look and feel.\"Clearly I wasn't the only one to have this problem, considering one of the most important stats the game tracks is deaths.\"There are boss rooms too, but these bosses are rather repetitive as well. I went through one run where I encountered the same boss four straight times. The repetition gets even more annoying considering that when you die, you start over entirely. There aren’t any chances to save your progress and start off in the room you died. Of course, the reason for that is because the game isn’t really about making progress.You’re supposed to rack up as many kills, power up and collect guns as much as possible and score as many points. Without a proper story to play through, there really isn’t a huge point to making that progress. As long as you go into Tower of Guns understanding and accepting that premise, you can have a decent, if not great time playing the game.This game was reviewed on the PlayStation 4.Being able to pick up and play is a nice change if you have 20 minutes to kill and you do indeed just want to kill some things. The art style is appealing, if you’re a fan of games like Borderlands 2 or the Telltale Games series. There aren’t a ton of controls to master either. Just point, shoot and jump.The randomly generated rooms don’t seem to have a great deal to pull from and that makes levels pretty repetitive. The best roguelikes will still have a story of some sort unfold in front of you while playing even if they aren’t beating you over the head with it. That’s not the case in Tower of Guns.Tower of Guns isn’t a bad game and it certainly doesn’t bill itself as anything more than what it is. A “lunchbreak FPS”is indeed an apropos descriptor. Still, it doesn’t bring enough new concepts to the table to really wow players.View MoreView MoreView MoreView MoreView MoreView MoreView MoreView MoreView More",
      "Bullets from cannons and sawblade projectiles; plasma and lasers and big friggin' missiles; blown-up loot piñatas emptied of bling; these are a few of my favorite things. Tower of Guns is a genre mash-up of bullet hell games, fast-paced first-person shooters, and roguelikes. And while the game isn't without its flaws, it delivers a high-energy rush.The objective of Tower of Guns is to, well, destroy the Tower of Guns. To do so, you navigate randomly generated levels chock-full of cannons, roving robots, and secret caches of cash. Each floor has a handful of rooms you have to blast your way through on your way to the boss. Of course, because you only have one life available for each attempt to defeat the tower's gauntlet, it's sometimes wiser to keep your gun holstered and simply play dodge(cannon)ball instead, though by doing so, you miss out on loot just begging to be grabbed.You begin each run by selecting a gun and a perk. The two guns available at the start aren't anything special, but you quickly unlock others; then you can decide what playstyle suits you best. Your gun options are quite diverse; whether you want to fire bouncing sawblades, highly explosive \"unicorn vomit,\" or the FPS-staple rocket launcher, Tower of Guns has you covered. When it comes to perks, you quickly realize there's no better option than your initial choice--the Bluegrass perk. Because who doesn't want to start with the ability to triple jump?As you progress through the levels, you gain access to additional jumps and faster movement while seeing a marked increase in difficulty. Although the early levels may seem sluggish, the pace ramps up until you've become completely lost in a delicate waltz weaving in and out of the oncoming onslaught. A normal successful playthrough only takes about 30 minutes (assuming you survive), but the endless mode sends you back into the tower time and time again until either your sanity or your body breaks.No attempt on the tower is the same twice, and although many of the levels will appear familiar as you play, there are always new level chunks to discover or a new enemy layout in a familiar landscape to keep repetitiveness from setting in. Even if every run were on identical terrain, for better or worse, each run is further differentiated by the loot that spawns. Some attempts may give you access to weapon modifications or items that make your destructive path easier to achieve. Others may give you more jumps sooner. If you're extremely unlucky, you may just find coins and hearts everywhere, leaving your arsenal a meager sampling of the game's great sandbox.Although you have only 10 guns to choose from, many more can be found throughout the game. Each gun progresses in power with experience pick-ups. On my best run, I had the option of swapping through six different guns I'd found to lay waste to the turrets impeding my advance. My personal favorite was a trumpet that launched shrapnel, but the game's Experience Cannon, which literally turns any acquired experience into a weapon, was certainly the most unique.The game controls are very fluid and simple to learn. Occasionally, you may encounter hitches when jumping, but that usually only happens if you're trying to add too much finesse to your ledge dancing. If you find it too difficult to leap across a great divide, you can elect to fire your weapon straight down and use the game's physics as a backwards propellant to give yourself more lift. Aiming can be a little difficult to grasp while moving because every shot is a projectile, forcing you to consider travel speed and distance.Each boss fight offers its own challenges. Though most are fairly easy to handle and are just larger versions of the constructs you fight as you progress through a dungeon, some, such as the stationary Pipe Organ or the Tilt-a-Whirlesque Egg Scrambler, offer a unique experience you can't find in the ordinary halls of the citadel. The game even ensures that fights against the same boss aren't identical. The most notable example of this is seen in run-ins with Dr. Turret; the level's layout can change, greatly altering the experience by segregating the different areas in which his weak point may spawn. Once you get enough jumps and jump height, some of the boss fights begin to get repetitive, but that's only a concern during the long grind of Endless mode--even then, it's not a common issue.The level design has its ups and downs. Each floor has a number of secret hiding spots where you can discover new items or loot, and you find out at the end of each level what percent of those secret spots you found. Some are extremely well hidden, and I rarely managed to maintain above a 50% discovery rate for the secrets. If you're a perfectionist, the secrets alone will keep you coming back for more. However, you may glitch through a wall that's not designed to hide a secret. Sometimes you're only there for a second before you're shoved back into the bounds of the map; at other times, you may find yourself completely outside the intended boundaries, free to roam where you were not intended to roam. Sometime, you might simply get stuck between a rocket and a hard place. The game is aware of this possibility, and it gives players the option to reset themselves back to the start of the room by holding Y. That doesn't make the potential hiccups any less annoying though. Some of the Ramparts levels are so easy to escape that the game brings up a dialogue window with a somewhat comedic message from the developer letting you know that you escaped the bounds of the map into an area of dodgy collision detection; the game reminds you about the reset function if you venture too far.The game's dialogue is easy to overlook, but it's worth it to stop for a moment and read it. Each storyline is laced with tongue-in-cheek humor and silly characters. One story features you playing as the developer's brother (the composer), and you critique various levels during a conversation with the developer. Although the story has no effect on the game itself, the different stories are all worth reading at least once--you'll get a good smile or a hearty chuckle out of them. Likewise, every loading screen features random punchy comments to further add to the game's comedic entertainment value and to make sure you know that the game doesn't take itself too seriously.The only other issue that can interrupt your enjoyment of Tower of Guns comes when you experience the harsh wake-up call that there is a such thing as too much fun. Whether due to the massive on-screen population of spinbots and bombs, the largest loot piñata explosion in history, or a tsunami of bullets, the game experiences a substantial drop in frames, which can lead to a frustrating, premature death. The only solution to the problem is to spray bullets, pray that you survive, and vacuum up your rewards before moving on to the next potential performance hit.Complaints aside, Tower of Guns delivers an engaging experience that is well suited to short bursts of play in its standard form or long marathons in its ranked endless mode. The game offers no shortage of fun. So grab your gun--it's time to go to bullet hell.We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.Use your keyboard!",

If    you're gonna win, you're gonna do it within an hour. That's a big if    though... it won't be easy. With random enemies, random power ups, random    bosses, tons of unlockable items and weapons... and even random-level    compositing - You never know what to expect! So grab a rocket-launcher, slap    a shotgun-modifier on it, pick up a hundred stackable 'double jumps' (or    centuple jumps at that point, I suppose) and get to conquering the Tower of    guns!       URL: http://www.towerofguns.com      ▄▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ ▓██ ▓▄  █ ▓██▀▀ ▀███▀ ▄██▀▄ ▓██   ▓██   ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▄   █▓                 ▓██ ▓██▄█  ▀██▄  ▓██  ▓██▄█ ▓██   ▓██                     █    ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀ ▀▀▀▀▀  ▀▀▀  ▀▀▀ ▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀     1.

Our games are made from physical sources if possible - like in    the good old times and how we think it should still be done. In our opinion    digital download versions should be tagged as such or at least it should be    noted in the nfo. Also we think that physical sources never could be dupes    of digital versions as well as CD versions are no dupes of DVD ones. All    old and still active scene rules proof that we are right (the new S.I.R    rules from 2009 and 2010 are not signed by any scene group and are not    active because of that).       We bring you games that other groups do not do. We are different, like us    or hate us. You think some games that we release are crap? We do not care    because we think that scene means that every game should be released.       To rise the quality of our releases we now try to make all our releases    both in normal image format (bin/cue or iso) as requested by the scene    rules and also in clone (Alcohol 120%) format.      ▄▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ ▄██▀▀ ▓██▀▄ ▓██▀▀ ▓██▀▀ ▀███▀ ▓██ ▓▄  █ ▄██▀▀ ▓██▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▄   █▓           ▓██ █ ▓██▄▀ ▓██▀  ▓██▀   ▓██  ▓██ ▓██▄█ ▓██ █  ▀██▄             █    ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀  ▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀  ▀▀▀  ▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀  ▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀        0x0815 - 0x0007 - FLT - GENESiS - GREENPEACE - PROPHET - DEFA - SMACKs                                    Razor1911 - RELOADED      Скиншоты            \n\n\n\n\n\nTower_Of_Guns-FASiSO.torrent\n\n\nТрекер:\nЗарегистрирован\n\n\r\n     \r\n    Скачать .torrent\n15 KB\n\n\n\nСтатус:\n √ проверено (by SEYTER в 05-Мар-14 18:27)\n\n\n\nЗарегистрирован:\n05-Мар-14 17:41\n\n\nСкачан:\n269 раз\n\n\nРазмер:\n\r\n     744 MB | \r\n    \n\n\nПоблагодарили:\nСкачать Tower Of Guns (Terrible Posture Games LLC) (ENG) [L] - FASiSO торрент\n\n\n\r\n         \r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    function humn_size (size) {\r\n      var i = 0;\r\n      var units = [\"B\", \"KB\", \"MB\", \"GB\", \"TB\", \"PB\", \"EB\", \"ZB\", \"YB\"];\r\n      while ((size/1024) >= 1) {\r\n        size = size/1024;\r\n        i++;\r\n      }\r\n      size = new String(size);\r\n      if (size.indexOf('.') != -1) {\r\n        size = size.substring(0, size.indexOf('.') + 3);\r\n      }\r\n      return size + ' ' + units[i];\r\n    }\r\n     \r\n    BB.tor_filelist_loaded = false;\r\n    $(document).ready(function(){\r\n      $('#tor-filelist-btn').click(function(){\r\n        $(\"html:not(:animated)\"+( ! $.browser.opera ? \",body:not(:animated)\" : \"\")).animate({scrollTop: $(\"a[name='fl']\").position().top});\r\n        if (BB.tor_filelist_loaded) {\r\n          $('#tor-fl-wrap').toggle();\r\n          return false;\r\n        }\r\n        $('#tor-fl-wrap').show();\r\n        $('#tor-filelist').load('torinfo.php', {a: 144436}, function(){\r\n          $('#tor-filelist > ul.tree-root').treeview({\r\n            control   : \"#tor-fl-treecontrol\",\r\n            persist   : \"location\"\r\n          });\r\n          $('#tor-filelist li.collapsable').each(function(){\r\n            var $li = $(this);\r\n            var dir_size = 0;\r\n            $('i', $li).each(function(){ dir_size += parseInt(this.innerHTML.replace(/\\D/g, '')) });\r\n            $('span.b:first', $li).append(' &middot; <s><b>' + humn_size(dir_size) + '</b></s>');\r\n          });                                            \r\n          $('#tor-filelist i').each(function(){\r\n            var size_bytes = this.innerHTML.replace(/\\D/g, '');\r\n            $(this).prepend('<s>'+ humn_size(size_bytes) +'</s> ');\r\n          });\r\n         BB.tor_filelist_loaded = true;    \r\n        });\r\n        $('#tor-fl-treecontrol a').click(function(){ this.blur(); });\r\n        return false;\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\najax.related_tor = function(pid, uid) { \r\n  $('#related_tor').slideToggle('fast');\r\n  if($('#related_tor').html()!=\"\") return;\r\n  ajax.exec({ \r\n    action  : 'related_tor', \r\n    tid    :  '161422',\r\n    t_title : 'Tower Of Guns (Terrible Posture Games LLC) (ENG) [L] - FASiSO'\r\n  }); \r\n}; \r\najax.callback.related_tor = function(data){\r\n  $('#related_tor').html(data.html);  \r\n};\r\n\n\r\n#tor-fl-wrap { margin: 12px auto 0; width: 95%; border: 1px solid #A5AFB4; background: #F8F8F8; display: none; }\r\n#fl-tbl-wrap { margin: 2px 14px 16px 14px; }\r\n#tor-fl-wrap td { background: #F8F8F8;; }\r\n#tor-filelist { margin: 0 2px; padding: 8px 6px; border: 1px solid #B5BEC4; background: #F4F4F4; max-height: 284px; overflow: auto; }\r\n#tor-filelist i { color: #7A7A7A; padding-left: 4px; }\r\n#tor-filelist s { color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none; }\r\n#tor-filelist .b { font-weight: bold; }\r\n#tor-filelist .tor-root-dir { font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 12px; padding-left: 4px; }\r\n#tor-fl-treecontrol { padding: 2px 0 4px; }\r\n#tor-fl-treecontrol a { padding: 0 8px; font-size: 11px; text-decoration: none; }\r\n#tor-fl-bgn { width: 200px; height: 300px; margin-right: 6px; border: 1px solid #B5BEC4;}\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nСвернуть директории·Развернуть·Переключить\n\n\nзагружается...\n\n\n\n\n\nПохожие раздачи\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEYTER\n\n\n\n\n\n 05-Мар-14 18:11\n(спустя 29 минут)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \r         !    Код:       copyText_writeLink('this.parentNode.parentNode.nextSibling.nextSibling');      Особенности игры в спойлер!

Our games are made from physical sources if possible - like in    the good old times and how we think it should still be done. In our opinion    digital download versions should be tagged as such or at least it should be    noted in the nfo. Also we think that physical sources never could be dupes    of digital versions as well as CD versions are no dupes of DVD ones. All    old and still active scene rules proof that we are right (the new S.I.R    rules from 2009 and 2010 are not signed by any scene group and are not    active because of that).       We bring you games that other groups do not do. We are different, like us    or hate us. You think some games that we release are crap? We do not care    because we think that scene means that every game should be released.       To rise the quality of our releases we now try to make all our releases    both in normal image format (bin/cue or iso) as requested by the scene    rules and also in clone (Alcohol 120%) format.      ▄▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ ▄██▀▀ ▓██▀▄ ▓██▀▀ ▓██▀▀ ▀███▀ ▓██ ▓▄  █ ▄██▀▀ ▓██▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▄   █▓           ▓██ █ ▓██▄▀ ▓██▀  ▓██▀   ▓██  ▓██ ▓██▄█ ▓██ █  ▀██▄             █    ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀  ▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀  ▀▀▀  ▀▀▀ ▀▀▀ ▀  ▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀ ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀        0x0815 - 0x0007 - FLT - GENESiS - GREENPEACE - PROPHET - DEFA - SMACKs                                    Razor1911 - RELOADED      Скиншоты            \n\n\n\n\n\nTower_Of_Guns-FASiSO.torrent\n\n\nТрекер:\nЗарегистрирован\n\n\r\n     \r\n    Скачать .torrent\n15 KB\n\n\n\nСтатус:\n √ проверено (by SEYTER в 05-Мар-14 18:27)\n\n\n\nЗарегистрирован:\n05-Мар-14 17:41\n\n\nСкачан:\n269 раз\n\n\nРазмер:\n\r\n     744 MB | \r\n    \n\n\nПоблагодарили:\nСкачать Tower Of Guns (Terrible Posture Games LLC) (ENG) [L] - FASiSO торрент\n\n\n\r\n         \r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n    function humn_size (size) {\r\n      var i = 0;\r\n      var units = [\"B\", \"KB\", \"MB\", \"GB\", \"TB\", \"PB\", \"EB\", \"ZB\", \"YB\"];\r\n      while ((size/1024) >= 1) {\r\n        size = size/1024;\r\n        i++;\r\n      }\r\n      size = new String(size);\r\n      if (size.indexOf('.') != -1) {\r\n        size = size.substring(0, size.indexOf('.') + 3);\r\n      }\r\n      return size + ' ' + units[i];\r\n    }\r\n     \r\n    BB.tor_filelist_loaded = false;\r\n    $(document).ready(function(){\r\n      $('#tor-filelist-btn').click(function(){\r\n        $(\"html:not(:animated)\"+( ! $.browser.opera ? \",body:not(:animated)\" : \"\")).animate({scrollTop: $(\"a[name='fl']\").position().top});\r\n        if (BB.tor_filelist_loaded) {\r\n          $('#tor-fl-wrap').toggle();\r\n          return false;\r\n        }\r\n        $('#tor-fl-wrap').show();\r\n        $('#tor-filelist').load('torinfo.php', {a: 144436}, function(){\r\n          $('#tor-filelist > ul.tree-root').treeview({\r\n            control   : \"#tor-fl-treecontrol\",\r\n            persist   : \"location\"\r\n          });\r\n          $('#tor-filelist li.collapsable').each(function(){\r\n            var $li = $(this);\r\n            var dir_size = 0;\r\n            $('i', $li).each(function(){ dir_size += parseInt(this.innerHTML.replace(/\\D/g, '')) });\r\n            $('span.b:first', $li).append(' &middot; <s><b>' + humn_size(dir_size) + '</b></s>');\r\n          });                                            \r\n          $('#tor-filelist i').each(function(){\r\n            var size_bytes = this.innerHTML.replace(/\\D/g, '');\r\n            $(this).prepend('<s>'+ humn_size(size_bytes) +'</s> ');\r\n          });\r\n         BB.tor_filelist_loaded = true;    \r\n        });\r\n        $('#tor-fl-treecontrol a').click(function(){ this.blur(); });\r\n        return false;\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\najax.related_tor = function(pid, uid) { \r\n  $('#related_tor').slideToggle('fast');\r\n  if($('#related_tor').html()!=\"\") return;\r\n  ajax.exec({ \r\n    action  : 'related_tor', \r\n    tid    :  '161422',\r\n    t_title : 'Tower Of Guns (Terrible Posture Games LLC) (ENG) [L] - FASiSO'\r\n  }); \r\n}; \r\najax.callback.related_tor = function(data){\r\n  $('#related_tor').html(data.html);  \r\n};\r\n\n\r\n#tor-fl-wrap { margin: 12px auto 0; width: 95%; border: 1px solid #A5AFB4; background: #F8F8F8; display: none; }\r\n#fl-tbl-wrap { margin: 2px 14px 16px 14px; }\r\n#tor-fl-wrap td { background: #F8F8F8;; }\r\n#tor-filelist { margin: 0 2px; padding: 8px 6px; border: 1px solid #B5BEC4; background: #F4F4F4; max-height: 284px; overflow: auto; }\r\n#tor-filelist i { color: #7A7A7A; padding-left: 4px; }\r\n#tor-filelist s { color: #0000FF; text-decoration: none; }\r\n#tor-filelist .b { font-weight: bold; }\r\n#tor-filelist .tor-root-dir { font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 12px; padding-left: 4px; }\r\n#tor-fl-treecontrol { padding: 2px 0 4px; }\r\n#tor-fl-treecontrol a { padding: 0 8px; font-size: 11px; text-decoration: none; }\r\n#tor-fl-bgn { width: 200px; height: 300px; margin-right: 6px; border: 1px solid #B5BEC4;}\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nСвернуть директории·Развернуть·Переключить\n\n\nзагружается...\n\n\n\n\n\nПохожие раздачиТрекер:ЗарегистрированСкачать .torrent\n15 KBСтатус:√ проверено (by SEYTER в 05-Мар-14 18:27)Зарегистрирован:05-Мар-14 17:41Скачан:269 разРазмер:744 MB |Поблагодарили:Скачать Tower Of Guns (Terrible Posture Games LLC) (ENG) [L] - FASiSO торрентСвернуть директории·Развернуть·Переключитьзагружается...SEYTER05-Мар-14 18:11\n(спустя 29 минут)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \r         !    Код:       copyText_writeLink('this.parentNode.parentNode.nextSibling.nextSibling');      Особенности игры в спойлер!

    "title": "Crypt of the Necrodancer",
    "text": [
      "Crypt of the NecroDancer is a roguelike rhythm video game developed and published by Canadian independent game studio Brace Yourself Games. The game takes fundamental elements of a roguelike dungeon exploration game, and adds a beat-matching rhythm game set to an original soundtrack written by Danny Baranowsky. The player's actions are most effective when moving the character set to the beat of the current song and are impaired when they miss a beat, so it is necessary to learn the rhythmic patterns that the various creatures follow. The mixed-genre game includes the ability to import custom music, and the option to use a dance pad instead of traditional controllers or the keyboard. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in April 2015, being co-published by Klei Entertainment, for the PlayStation 4 and Vita in February 2016, for the Xbox One in February 2017, and for Nintendo Switch in February 2018. Crypt of the NecroDancer Pocket Edition, developed for iOS was released in June 2016.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nCrypt of the NecroDancer is a top-down 2D roguelike rhythm game in which the player controls one of a selection of characters to explore several levels of an underground dungeon that are procedurally generated, similar to roguelike games.\nPlayers can manipulate their character by using either a dance pad, a keyboard, or a gamepad. Unlike traditional roguelikes, the player can only have their character move or attack if they perform the action on the beat of the music. As with many rhythm games, each successful beat match boosts a coin scoring multiplier. Failure to match the beat does not directly harm the character in most situations, but does reset the scoring multiplier and may cause the character to be harmed by a nearby monster if he/she is in their attack path. The character can also be harmed by moving into a monster's attack. When the character's health meter empties, the game is over. Monsters move according to predetermined patterns which the player must learn in order to attack and avoid damage.\n\nAs the player explores, they will collect new weapons, armor, usable items, and treasure; the player's inventory is automatically managed by the game. Defeating monsters yields a number of coins that can be used to purchase items from shops within the dungeon. There are also diamonds that are used for purchasing permanent enhancements to the character's abilities in the game's lobby. The dungeon is divided into four zones of four levels each. The first three levels of each zone require the player to find the exit and defeat a mini-boss to unlock it; the fourth level is a larger boss character that must be defeated to progress further. In addition, the player is limited to the length of the song to complete the level; when the song ends, they are automatically sent to the next level through a trapdoor, forgoing the rewards of completing the level.\nThe player returns to the game's lobby area after dying or optionally at any time, losing any items, gold, or other equipment, though retaining any diamonds they have found. The lobby features shops where the player can spend those diamonds for permanent upgrades before restarting the game or, if they have completed any zones, accessing the next available zone. The player can also access other game modes, such as \"All Zones Mode\"  in which the player must make their way through the entire crypt without dying. The player initially has access to the main character, Cadence, but new characters with different modes of play also become available as the player completes certain goals: for example, the monk character receives one free item in each shop, but immediately dies if he touches gold. Special trainers and other beneficial non-player characters can be rescued from certain zones, and once rescued, will provide services to the player from the main lobby, such as letting the player train against enemies and bosses, or providing items that the player can buy with diamonds and use on their next journey into the crypt.\nThe songs in the game's soundtracks are ordered in ascending tempo across zones and levels, making deeper levels more challenging than earlier ones. The user additionally has the ability to set custom music for each of the game's levels.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the main game, the player controls Cadence, the daughter of a famed treasure hunter who has gone missing. In searching for him, she falls into a crypt controlled by the NecroDancer, who literally steals Cadence's heart and forces her to challenge his minions to retrieve it. She is forced to fight through the crypt's dungeon with her actions tied to the beat of the music and her heart, so as to stay alive and defeat the NecroDancer.\nNear the heart of the crypt, Cadence finds one of the NecroDancer's minions named \"Dead Ringer\". She defeats him, revealing that it was her missing father and frees him from the NecroDancer's control, allowing him to help her defeat the NecroDancer. They take the NecroDancer's magical golden Lute and use it to kill him, and then use its power to resurrect Cadence's dead mother, Melody. However, they discover that the lute is cursed; Melody must keep playing it forever to sustain her life, but the lute will gradually consume her humanity just as it did to the NecroDancer. Melody enters the crypt in search of answers and a way to break the curse of the lute.\nWhen Melody reaches the end of the crypt, she uses the Golden Lute to resurrect the NecroDancer and find answers, but he attacks and Melody defeats him. The NecroDancer tries to flee, but is cast into a crevice by Aria (Melody's mother) who was lying in a coffin with a dagger in her chest and is brought back to life by the Lute. Aria reveals that she knows how to break the curse of the lute, but was betrayed by the NecroDancer and left for dead. Intending to finish what she started, she begins her ascent out of the crypt in search of a shrine that will destroy the lute once and for all.\nWhen Aria reaches the shrine, she is attacked by the lute itself, which mutates into a large monster in an attempt to save itself from destruction. After defeating the lute's monster form, Aria sacrifices her life to destroy the cursed instrument, returning Melody to full life and allowing her to return to her family, who later bury Aria together.\n\n\n== Development ==\nCrypt of the NecroDancer was a creation of programmer Ryan Clark, inspired by thinking about the traditional structure of roguelike games. Clark found that the player-character's death in roguelikes often occurred due to conditions created by the procedural-generation of the game as opposed to player's skill, and wanted to make a game that was more \"fair\" to the player to escape or avoid seemingly difficult situations. Clark considered how games like Spelunky put the player more in control of their fate, as he viewed it as \"a game that is really hard but you can still improve. If you die, you still know it was your fault\" whereas in other games a player might die because \"the game is simply unfair.\" However, Clark also found that removing the turn-based nature of roguelike in games like Spelunky or FTL: Faster Than Light lost some of the flavor of roguelikes, and sought a way to maintain the turn-based nature. They came up with the idea of using turns where each turn lasted only a short amount of real time; as such the \"lack of time to think renders impossible the careful study and patience of the expert NetHack player\". With this concept, Clark recognized that this was similar to beat-matching rhythm games, and quickly refined the concept around the rhythm-based roguelike game. The title came after discovering this concept, and plays on the pun of the word \"necromancer\".Initially, Clark programmed the game to require the player to be relatively accurate to the music's beat, similar to the accuracy used by rhythm games. He found this timing to be too tense, as the player was more likely to miss the short accuracy window while stressed and would lead to the character being harmed, creating more stress on the player. Instead, he greatly expanded the accuracy window, as well as programmed a simple autocalibration system that recognized if the player was ahead or behind the beat to some degree as to match the player's current stress levels, both aimed to help make the game more fair and remove player frustration. Furthermore, he found that when he had the player move on the beat and monsters on the half-beat, the game played too closely to a roguelike and instead had all characters move on the beat, with the player's action having priority, which while posed a few drawbacks he had to program around, felt much more natural to the game.The Beat tracking algorithm used in the game is known as Multifeature Beat tracker. It is implemented in the Essentia framework and determines the positions of the beats in order to estimate the beats per minute, which is then used to set the tempo for the game.\nThe game was developed using the Monkey X programming language.The game was released on Steam early access on July 30, 2014, using public feedback to improve the title, with full release on April 23, 2015. The game was released for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on February 2, 2016. An iOS version, with support for both screen and Bluetooth controllers, was released on June 30, 2016.  An Xbox One version of the game was released on February 10, 2017. A Nintendo Switch version was released on February 1, 2018, which includes a new character exclusive to the platform as well as co-operative support.The developers announced plans to release a prequel expansion, Crypt of the NecroDancer: Amplified, to the game in September 2016. They \nintroduced this expansion through Early Access on Steam starting on January 24, 2017 to get feedback during development. The expansion includes an additional zone, a new boss named Fortissimole, a new protagonist called Nocturna, new non-main characters named Diamond, Mary and Tempo, a new soundtrack by OverClocked Remix, and new items for the game, including familiars for the protagonist.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe game's soundtrack was composed by Danny Baranowsky, designed to vary in speed and rhythmic complexity the farther the player gets within the game. The game has four additional soundtracks: an EDM soundtrack by Alex Esquivel (\"A_Rival\") from group Super Square, a heavy metal soundtrack by YouTube personality Jules Conroy, better known as \"FamilyJules\", a \"freestyle retro\" soundtrack by composer Jake Kaufman, also known as \"virt\", and a synthwave soundtrack by various artists from Girlfriend Records.The Crypt of the Necrodancer Amplified DLC added a fifth additional soundtrack by OverClocked ReMix.The Xbox One version of the game added a sixth additional soundtrack by Chipzel.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nCritical reception was positive. Destructoid named the game one of their favorite entries at PAX Prime 2013, and praised its execution. Joystiq also gave the game a positive review.\n\n\n== Accolades ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

Can you survive this deadly dungeon of dance, slay the NecroDancer, and recapture your still beating heart?  Or will you be a slave to the rhythm for all eternity?

Groove with the game's epic dance soundtrack, or select songs from your own MP3 collection.  You can even play with a dance pad to really shake your bones!Selected for more than a dozen festivals and award shows across 4 continents, Crypt of the NecroDancer is one of the world's most loved independent games.  It was the #1 selling game on Steam at its Early Access launch, and the #3 top rated Steam game of all time at its full launch.Crypt of the NecroDancer was born of the desire to make a roguelike game \"fair\".  As a roguelike gamers, we have seen our share of deaths!  But the most frustrating deaths are those from which we learn nothing, or had no chance to avoid.  Some roguelikes, like Nethack, boast fairly high win rates for elite players.  This is good -- it indicates that, while there is randomness, there are ways to tame that randomness and overcome it.  However, to become such an elite Nethack player requires dedicated study of it's lore, an excellent memory, and patience.  We wanted to create a game that is fair (a high win rate among elite players), yet without the onerous knowledge requirements.  Crypt of the NecroDancer is our attempt at achieving this goal.  It is turn based, but the turns are of an enforced length.  Lack of time to think renders impossible the careful study and patience of the expert NetHack player.  Instead, skill and experience in battle rule the day.  No more random deaths -- there is always a way out, for the skilled NecroDancer player!Ryan ClarkDesign, programmingTed MartensPixel art and animationDanny BaranowskyComposerOliver TrujilloProgrammingKevin Regamey, Jeff Tangsoc (PowerUp Audio)Sound DesignJesse TurnerHigh res artMarlon WiebeTrailers and cutscenesHeather WilsonProducer and Community ManagerInquiries[email protected]Twittertwitter.com/NecroDancerGameFacebookfacebook.com/CryptOfTheNecroDancerWebbraceyourselfgames.comUSD$14.99",
      "By\nChris Thursten\n2015-05-12T16:07:07.131ZReviewA beautifully designed, tough, and cheerful roguelike that rewards perseverance with a singular feeling of finesse.Unlike many games that carry the label, Crypt of the Necrodancer is a roguelike that is actually quite a bit like Rogue. You control a lone hero in a grid-based dungeon, pushing back the fog of war square by square as you explore each randomly-generated set of chambers. As you journey deeper you gather gear, spells and consumables to help you survive encounters with monsters who behave according to predictable routines. If you die, you start over from the beginning.In a traditional roguelike, your greatest asset is the time you're afforded to think, assess, plan. Crypt of the Necrodancer's defining flourish is that it reduces your thinking time to the space between two beats on the soundtrack. Move to the rhythm and you build up a multiplier, turning the ground into an illuminated dancefloor and boosting the gold you earn from every kill. In order to be able to afford the best gear, then, you should always be moving. Move thoughtlessly, however, and you'll die. The result is a game where you are always taking action but only sporadically acting well. What was once a meditative, considered experience becomes a rush of on-the-fly strategy and occasional finesse—becomes, in short, a dance.Every enemy introduces a new pattern to learn, from oozes that bounce back and forth along set routes to shield-bearing skeletons that need to be dodged from the front and disarmed from the side. Initially, you'll scrape through these encounters by relying on your reactions. In order to really progress, however, you need to memorise each pattern and then practice enough for the right counters to become second nature. This process is further complicated by your gear. Different weapons have different attack patterns and your options are expanded laterally by magic rings, spells, and the ability to tunnel through walls. The optimal approach to a given room, then, is something you'll need to figure out fresh every time you play. It's here that Necrodancer's skill ceiling rockets upwards, and where the game becomes essential for players who love mastering complex combat systems.In most rhythm games, the pattern you need to follow is right there on the screen. Here, the pattern is something you learn to perceive. One of the most gratifying feelings a roguelike can convey is the sense that your understanding has tangibly improved despite repeated failure. Crypt of the Necrodancer nails that feeling. You start out clumsy and improvisational and many hours later you come out graceful and confident. This is a point of powerful confluence between the roguelike and the rhythm game, and Necrodancer's devs make the most of it.The core game follows the Spelunky model of four main worlds subdivided into individual levels, although Necrodancer inserts clever boss battles between each one. To make progress more palatable for those still learning, you can take on each world one by one if you'd prefer not to be reset to the beginning every time. In this mode, you're also able to rescue NPCs that sell permanent upgrades. This provides you with a way to gradually make a tough section accessible, evening out the formidable difficulty curve and ensuring that you'll (eventually) see the ending.You also unlock new characters as you go, and these fundamentally change what the game is about. Bard, for example, doesn't need to move to the beat at all. Dove can't attack, but unlike other characters doesn't need to defeat mini-bosses to open up exits. Eli can't use regular weapons but can plant and kick infinite bombs, turning Necrodancer into Bomberman with a beat. Combine them with local co-op, Steam Workshop mod support, daily challenges and extreme difficulty options to consider and you have a simple game with a vast amount of long-term potential.It's full of lovely little touches, from the way that the shopkeeper sings along to the soundtrack (provided you're not using your own music, which is also an option) to the way the simple animations for each creature sync up with the rhythm. The music's great too, as you'd expect—playful, punchy and varied.Crypt of the Necrodancer strikes the balance between charm, readability and difficulty that is so important for a game of this type, and it does so off the back of a set of brilliantly-executed new ideas. It's not just a good rhythm-action game and a good roguelike: saying so suggests that the two might be divisible in some way. In this case, they're not.What Is It? Rhythm-based roguelike that demands coordination and perseverance.

      "Tunes from the cryptDance Dance Revolution was a large part of an earlier era of my life. Going though dance pads year after year until I finally convinced my parents to get me one of the \"big boy\" pads for a lot more money. Eventually I grew past that era, but that part of my life will always be fondly remembered.These days, games like DDR seem to be old hat, and roguelikes are the new hot genre in town. In comes Crypt of the NecroDancer to merge the two; flawlessly I might add, and rekindle that old love with my new love.Man, is it lovely.Crypt of the NecroDancer (Linux, Mac, PC [reviewed])Developer: Brace Yourself GamesPublisher: Brace Yourself Games, KleiRelease Date: April 23, 2015MSRP: $14.99It would be a criminal act to not immediately mention the music in Crypt of the NecroDancer as it plays a starring role and deserves the first-paragraph treatment. This is mostly due to the fact that music is interwoven into the gameplay itself. The player can only act in time with the beat, which is also when the enemies act. Said beat has a visual representation on the bottom of the screen to help players get accustomed to it, but after a short while most players will be acting based on the audio cue, not the visual. When done correctly, the music, movements, and sound effects line up to create something that can only be described as \"groovy.\"In a game where music is at the core of the experience, the soundtrack could have easily made the game fall flat. Thankfully, this is not the case. There are three soundtracks built into the game. The default music is by Danny Baranowsky, and it is amazingly brilliant and brilliantly amazing. The tunes for each level are varied, yet all of them are catchy. The other soundtracks are a metal remix by FamilyJules7X and an EDM version by A_Rival, and also assuage the eardrums. Regardless of music preference, players are bound to dig one, if not all, of these versions. It's also possible for players to import their own music for people who don't like good music, or just want to work with something different.The game isn't just about boppin' along to some great music, though; there is a story at play here. There are cutscenes for characters between zones, and paying attention to them, as well as some in-game hints, alludes to a pretty big overarching story. It's split over multiple playthroughs with different characters, so it will take some time to reveal the whole thing. The lore is legitimately interesting, something many players may not be expecting.Every action is mapped to the arrow keys. In fact, the game can even be played with a dance pad! There's a specific mode for dance pad play, which makes the game a bit easier since the control method is inherently more difficult. This also serves as an easier mode to introduce players to the game who don't feel they are up to the full challenge quite yet. When playing with a controller, everything is mapped to the face buttons, which can also be remapped to the player's liking.Attacking is as simple as pressing the direction of the enemy. Items and spells are also available, and are used by pressing a combination of two arrow keys. For example, to use a bomb, players must press down and left (by default) on the beat. Various weapon types will alter where enemies can be killed in relation to the player, and it is of the utmost important to know a weapon's attack range.When moving, the game will check if anything can be attacked first. So if a player is expecting to move forward but an enemy is within attack range, the attack will happen. This means the character will remain stationary, which can be bad news in certain situations. Knowing these attack mechanics is crucial, and thankfully there is a weapon range in the game where players can try out all the different types of weapons and learn them inside and out. I recommend doing this at least once, especially for the whip.In addition to weapons, players have access to a shovel for digging through walls, a consumable item, a torch, armor, a ring, and a spell. Armor is split up into head, chest, and feet, making there a lot of items to equip for a full \"set.\" The items found are random so make sure to pray to RNGesus before each run!Many items must be unlocked before they show up in chests within the dungeon. Unlocking items is permanent and costs diamonds, which can be found in the dungeon itself. Any diamonds not spent in between runs are lost forever, giving the player all the incentive in the world to spend them on something. It's the perfect system of progression in a game that otherwise has very little, ensuring that even the \"terrible\" runs can usually yield some sort of good news and contribute to the greater good.The dungeon is split into four distinct zones, each with its own atmosphere, enemies, and randomly generated layout. The first two are on the simpler side of things, but the third and fourth zones introduce new tile mechanics and are completely unique. It's amazing how fast confidence plummets after beating one zone and entering another. It's easy to be on a bit of a high after beating a boss for the first time, only to be introduced to a brand new area where players know basically nothing. It's a kick in the pants, and it feels so good.Speaking of the boss fights, each one in NecroDancer is incredibly memorable. Each one has its own theme and executes it perfectly. My favorite is definitely Deep Blues, which puts the player against an entire set of chess pieces as enemies, who move according to the chess ruleset. Seeing a boss for the first time usually results in a bit of laughter followed by an \"oh shit\" as the gravity of the situation sets in. Then death, of course.Some bosses are definitely easier to comprehend than others (I don't want to use the term \"easier in general\"), and the boss fights at the end of zones one through three are randomly chosen, which exacerbates the feeling of luck that's inherent in the roguelike genre. There's likely going to be some aggravation from time to time, simply because of bad luck. This frustration is lessened because of the diamond system, but the feeling of futility is occasionally hard to fight back, especially when there's nothing left to spend diamonds on.While each zone shares some common enemies, the enemy variety in each zone is largely unique. Some weapons may feel overpowered in one zone, and completely useless in another simply because of the change in enemy behavior. This makes the \"all zones\" runs that much harder. Some enemy types will be \"buffed\" in later zones, adding more health or variants on the original behavior.After completing the four core areas, there is still plenty to keep players occupied. Crypt of the NecroDancer also supports mods, and they are dead simple to use. All you have to do is download a mod from the Steam Workshop, then activate it from the pause menu. Many of the mods are currently music changes or skin changes, but only time will tell how far they go in the future.Different characters are also unlocked by accomplishing certain goals, and these characters are way more than just re-skins of the main character, Candace. The Monk, for example, can choose any one item from the Shopkeeper for free, but will die instantly if he lands on gold. Considering gold is dropped by literally every enemy, this forces a huge change in playstyle. I couldn't even get past the first zone!In addition to the standard dungeon, which can also be tackled with two players in local multiplayer, there is a boss fight arena, an enemy behavior trainer, a codex for advanced skills, a daily challenge, and a level editor. Beating the game once is really only the beginning. There are enough variations on the basic playthrough to keep players coming back for a long time.Crypt of the NecroDancer accomplishes what few games even attempt to do. It merges together two completely different genres: rhythm and roguelike. The frustrations of both come as part of the package, but some intelligent design decisions help to alleviate the issue. For those looking for the next gaming obsession after the likes of Spelunky, Binding of Isaac, or Rogue Legacy, look no further than Crypt of the NecroDancer.[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]You are logged out.

Click here for more informationWelcome to the beginning of our coverage on interesting indie funding projects (Kickstarter, IndieGoGo), Steam Greenlight games, and news and previews!Platform: PC/Mac\nDRM: Steam\nDeveloper: Brace Yourself Games\nGenre: Roguelike/Rhythm Adventure/Awesomesauce\nPlanned Release: Unknown/Early Access Late 2013\nPrice: $14.99USD ($13.99USD if preordered)\nOfficial WebsiteThere are no words for how badly I want to play the upcoming roguelike/rhythm game Crypt of the NecroDancer, and if the soul of a funky fresh dancer lives within you, or if you just refuse to admit your random thrashing looks nothing like dancing, then chances are you'll feel the same. From Brace Yourself Games comes a tale of a gutsy young woman whose beating heart is stolen when she accidentally falls into the tomb of an ancient wizard and awakens him. Now, she ventures forth into the (procedurally generated) crypt to recover it, facing off against dragons, zombies, skeletons and much more, gathering weapons and upgrades... through the magic of dance!See, Crypt of the NecroDancer's gimmick is that you can play it with either your keyboard or a dance pad, turning the turn-based classic roguelike gameplay into a test of strategy, timing, and of course, rhythm. Rather than being able to hem and haw until you choose the perfect mode of attack for any situation, you'll be forced to act within a certain amount of time. Each beat of the music is a turn, and nailing the music allows you to rack up multipliers. Typically, time limits, even musical ones, are the sort of thing that tends to make a lot of players begin the Hedging Noise Symphony, but Crypt of the NecroDancer promises to be accessible to players of any skill level rather than the typical punishing difficulty usually associated with roguelikes. Throw in the ability to use your own Dance Dance Revolution pad and MP3s if you like and I'm sold. Yes, I'm going to be slaying monsters to Don't Stop Believin' and Smile, Smile, Smile... and I'm not sorry..It doesn't hurt that the game looks gorgeous as well, with a colourful pixel style, and the game's own soundtrack is downright awesome enough that you might not find yourself immediately reaching for those MP3s off the bat. Interestingly, the developers are \"developing the game publicly\", so you can follow along in the forums instead of just peering in their windows under the cover of night like usual. Crypt of the NecroDancer will hit Steam in Early Access sometime later this year, and you can pre-order the game for $13.99USD (a 10% discount) to help it along. Check out the official website for trailers, screenshots, and even more information!^ Scroll Up | Homepage >Hello, while a lot of people probably like this new kind of review, me I have to say that the main reason why I check jayisgames only, instead of indiegames.com for example, is because you do not post dozen of teasers of some games until they are released.This goes in this way, so, could it be possible for example, to be able to customize the rss feed, like by not receiving posts with some tags (in my case I would also add \"mobile\" since I don't own an android/iphone and most likely never will) ? The rss feed not displaying game images, it may be better to be able to customize directly on the website although.Thanks for reading.Hi zzzzz. :) I understand that you aren't interested in these previews, but they're something we've wanted to do for a while and people have asked for. I don't think two articles in three days is a lot, personally, and I have always been careful and clear in descriptions that show up in the RSS feed to mark these (\"Coming later this year\", for instance) as non-reviews, and the appropriate tags display as well which should allow you to know to ignore them.Barring that, bookmarking https://jayisgames.com/browser/ and https://jayisgames.com/indie/ should suit your needs fine I hope in the meantime if we can't find any other solution. :)Thanks for replying that quickly, I will do with that.Oooh, I remember hearing about this game! I'm still on the fence about whether to get it or not, although the option of using my dance mat is so very tempting. I might wait until a few LPers give it a once-over.On an unrelated note, I have now decided that Dora and I are possible alternate reality twins, due to our similar tastes in humor/music, but more than likely different upbringings and such. :PPersonally I'm glad to finally see more indie games being talked about here. I'm not really a big gamer but recently have been looking for more info about things that aren't flash games or Big Fish offerings. A lot of my recent game purchases have been things I've discovered via Humble Bundles/similar or browsing for indie games elsewhere. Jayisgames is my daily reading, and I'm happy that I won't have to hunt around to find out about other games - keeping my RSS feeds cleaner and ensuring my time is better spent playing and not researching.UpdateLeave a comment [top of page]All games mentioned or hosted and images appearing on JayIsGames are Copyright their respective owner(s).All other content is Copyright ©2003-2018 JayIsGames.com.

Put a few hours into it; haven't even cleared the first dungeon yet, but I don't care.\n\nAlso, anyone else get confused after playing for a while when the world around you doesn't move to a beat?@SatelliteOfLove Curious what your #1 and 2 OSTs were?@Kadrom \n\nTrails in the Sky: Second Chapter and Trails of Cold Steel 1.",

      "The indie gaming scene is filled with roguelike dungeon crawlers, especially those sporting a pixelated visual style, and Crypt of the Necrodancer, coming from Brace Yourself Games, is no exception.However, as its name suggests, it's a bit more than just your regular dungeon crawling experience. Instead of slowly maneuvering your way through randomly generated crypts while fighting different enemies, you dance your way through them.In order to defeat foes and keep earning as much loot and currency as possible, you need to match the beat of the song and keep doing that until you find the exit. As you can imagine, this is easier said than done, but the game manages to remain accessible and keep the soundtrack as varied as possible, while throwing in the option to use your own songs.Does Crypt of the Necrodancer play a successful tune or should we just stop moving? Let's find out.Roguelike games are never that fond of complex stories, and Crypt of the Necrodancer isn't an exception. It does open with the narrative involving the main protagonist, a young girl named Cadence, who must travel through various dungeons to complete her escape, after being resurrected by a necromancer.You meet an opera-singing merchant along the way, as well as various non-playable characters that can help make your randomly generated adventures a bit easier to tackle. There are also plenty of different unlockable protagonists with different side stories, so you'll still have reasons to keep going besides the catchy soundtrack and its remixes.Without a doubt, the rhythm-based movement and combat system in Necrodancer is one of the most refreshing in years and definitely one of the most outlandish ones. While in theory it sounds interesting, once you begin to think about putting it into practice, you can already see potential problems.Fortunately, Brace Yourself Games has managed to overcome most of the possible obstacles by implementing an easy to learn yet hard to master beat-matching system. In case you can't really match what you're hearing, you have a heart that's pumping to the beat, so you can always try to follow it instead.Matching the beat isn't mandatory, but skipping it causes you to lose your coin multiplier and leaves you exposed to enemy attacks. As such, you might want to keep things constant, even though that's easier said than done.If you really can't match a beat to save your virtual life, you can pick Bard, one of the unlocked characters alongside Cadence, who doesn’t need to stick to the beat. Instead, his movement prompts movement from the enemies on the screen. As such, you're more or less treated to a game of virtual chess, as you have to constantly ensure that you keep your enemies in a vulnerable state or know when to get out of possible converging paths.Speaking of enemies, they are extremely varied, as befitting of a roguelike experience, starting with slime balls and continuing with bats, skeletons, zombies, dragons, and much more. Some sit still or have simple patrol patterns but others are much more dynamic, and if you aren't careful, they can easily diminish your hearts and cause you to restart.To make things easier, you wield a shovel and a basic sword in the beginning but can unlock all sorts of new things by either finding them in the levels or by spending the in-game gold or the in-game diamonds. The coins can be spent at the shops scattered throughout the levels, while the diamonds are used in the main hub zone to unlock items that you can then find in chests during the actual stages.Besides finding weapons and loot, you also uncover new items throughout your adventures. These include consumables like turkey legs or apples that replenish your hearts, but also one-time use scrolls to unleash deadly fire blasts and other such things, not to mention spells.The main downside is that using them means pressing, as standard, combinations of the arrow keys on the keyboard. This is a bit awkward at first and still means that you have to take your eyes off the action to see what combination is needed. When you're swarmed by foes or unsure where to go, this action can lead to death or at least some lost health.Death is pretty much a given in roguelike experiences, and while Crypt of the Necrodancer does alleviate some of the frustration with its charm and innovative system, it can still wear on your nerves, especially if you don't really like the specific song in that instance.The game can be played cooperatively with a friend, but things can get even more hectic as you're trying to stick to the beat and coordinate your attacks or movement.There are quite a lot of unlockable characters besides Cadence and Bard, including a monk that dies when picking up gold but can get one free item each visit to the store, or Dove, who doesn't kill enemies and can walk through exits without defeating the necessary bosses. They each provide different gameplay paradigm shifts, and it's quite fun to switch them up, at least until you get killed and grow weary.Crypt of the Necrodancer sports a pretty good pixelated style that manages to feel custom even though it's been used by many other indie games nowadays. The visual effects are good and the character models, even the enemies, look sharp.Of course, the main aspect is the soundtrack, which comes in three distinct variations, as there's a standard one, a rock-themed remix, as well as an EDM one. Throw in the possibility of playing your own songs and you're in for a varied time.",

The main catch of this game is to move with the beat, in doing so you navigate through the various levels and able to attack. Items are key to making it throughout the various levels which are gained by either the shop keeper or random chests. Every level is randomly generated levels meaning no level will ever feel similar. If you like a dungeon crawlers with rising difficulty as well as a new take on the genre then pick this game up you'll be doing yourself a huge favor.47 out of 50 people found this helpful.2/8/2017Awesoman519XboxRating:5/5I played the PC version and believe me, this game is a blast to play.

First, props to developers trying something new!  While there's nothing inherently terrible about the game (and I'm a big fan of both genres), it perhaps lacks enough of either ingredients.  Music is good, graphics okay, decent amount of content, controls are functional, a few crashes.  Price is okay.  Just wanted to REALLY like it.

I don't own a PC so I watched alot of streamers play it.

I've missed a few beats because the delayed action threw me off. And this was after doing the latency calibration thing. I don't know if it has to do with my settings or anything, but I really want to enjoy this game, I've been watching it since it was early access on Steam, but I don't want my personal experience to be ruined by this sound issue.

      "Like the zombified dancers in Thriller, Crypt of the Necrodancer’s latest (and largest) update has slid onto Steam. It adds new characters, NPCs, and a whole new boss fight – the Coral Riff.As if fighting dragons through the power of dance wasn’t enough, Coral Riff is an entire band of enemies, from violins to drums, you need to dispatch.Brace Yourself Games has you explore an ever-deepening dungeon by moving in time to the game’s soundtrack. You can only hit enemies by moving into them on the beat, otherwise you’ll take damage. I’ve played a little (until my lack of rhythm became impossible to deny) and it’s unlike any dungeon crawler I’ve ever played.The highlights of the update are the new characters: Melody and Dorian. Each character in Crypt has different starting equipment and stats, some are waiflike in the health department but pack a cracking punch (still, for the rhythmically challenged you might want to go someone a little more forgiving, like the bard).There’s also three new NPC characters – the shriner, pawnbroker, and conjurer – who you can meet in your journey deeper into the dungeons. Each can provide a different service to aid your descent. The pawnbroker for instance will buy items off you, giving you gold in return which you can use to buy equipment from the shopkeeper.The final big addition is the new boss: Coral Riff. You can see him in action here:Do you reckon you could win in a fight against a keytar?You can read the full patch notes on the next page.– Added new boss battle: Coral Riff!– Added two new characters: Melody and Dorian!– Added three new NPCs: Shriner, Pawnbroker, and Conjurer– Added three character options: Random, Deathless, and All Characters– Made holster use LEFT+RIGHT slot, so you can now store weapons in holster for future throwing– Added new voiceovers for Aria, Melody, and Dorian– Added an option to enable VSYNC– Game now automatically pauses when minimized– Reduced Dagger of Phasing damage to 2– Made Dagger of Frost do piercing damage– fixed issue where killing shopkeeper would affect run RNG– fixed issue where some characters would die when entering DDR mode– fixed crash when player 2 steps on single player mode stairs in lobby– fixed crash from using invisible ‘prev page’ option in level editor– fixed issue where you could stall by pressing both a direction and the alternate binding for that direction– Made the game default to Bard for debug builds, since he’s much easier/faster to test with– made distinction between phasing and piercing weapons– fixed issue with leprechauns moving while doing their disappear animation– fixed crash bug in input class related to custom key bindings (could be the cause of some of the crashes on startup?)– made giant armadillos able to destroy all destructible wall types– made it so enemies killed by traps don’t count towards spell cooldowns– made barrels/crates not count for ring of courage, blood weapons, spell cooldowns, etc– fixed bug where bomb traps were disappearing from level editor levels– took holy water & boots of lunging out or Dove’s item pool– fixed bug where Aria wouldn’t die from missed beat in training mode– fixed bug where arena items could disappear if a shrine was used on the same level– fixed bug where teh urn would not collide in certain situations after having been dropped down a trapdoor– fixed bug where fear would persist across levels– fixed bugs where minotaur would sometimes charge incorrectly– added downloaded_mods folder to try to prevent re-publication of mods– hide confusion particles if you die when confused– fixed bug that sometimes allowed 2 chests (one normal, one mimic) in one level in hardcore– made diamond dealer’s items not refresh until one is bought– added glass jaw to shrine of glass and scroll of need effects– made Eli unable to kick bombs that are inside of walls (with ring of phasing)– made it so thrown weapons and rifle shots can aggro shopkeepers– made purple scroll drops deterministic– made armadillos not charge until the beat after they’ve been visible– made all mimics damageable by bombs even when stealthed– added Hephaestus art– fixed bug where urns can get stuck in walls in boss level– fixed bug where janitor wouldn’t remove an item from the pending spawn item pool– fixed bug where frost and knockback weapons were also affecting holy water, boots of pain, etc.– fixed a few erroneous item pool items– fixed bug where things like golden lute could be generated by scroll of need, transmuting, etc.– fixed bug where large enemies could open a metal door and then move again on the next beat– made enemies that move through walls still seek if player is in walls– fixed bugs with wraiths + earthquake/freeze spells– fixed issue where wraiths could spawn too close to player after shrine of war– made wraiths unable to spawn in secret shops– fixed bugs with Dove getting hit while submitting scores, and not unlocking zones properly– fixed bug where rook could castle without the king– Tweaked some character select stair text– fixed banshee audio bug– fixed bug that could cause score message to persist and enemies to not move– Fixed the monkey code so that Render+Update are always called at the same time on Mac+Lin– Added new travel rune images for the added NPCs– Added hammering sound for Hephaestus– added code to pause the game when the window is minimized (should work with mac/linux too I think)– moved frame capturing for post-death replay into C++, hopefully will reduce GC time– Fixed crash bug with Ring of Charisma and non-sale shrines– Made Dorian not leap in the lobby– Fixed issue where Dorian and Eli were not animating to the beat properlyShareClicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.PromotedHow to master Monster Hunter: World’s deep combat system7 reasons you should return to RuneScape and Old School RuneScapeWhy a visit to Monster Hunter: World should be your videogame summer vacation",

      "Crypt of the NecroDancer is a 2015 independent video game designed by Brace Yourself Games. The game takes fundamental elements of a roguelike dungeon exploration game, and adds beat-matching rhythm game set to Danny Baranowsky’s soundtrack, to move and control the protagonist character; the player’s actions will be most effective by continuing to the move the character set to the beat of the current song and are penalized when they miss a beat, and by learning the patterns that the various creatures use in time to the beat. The mixed genre game includes the ability to import custom music for the game, and for the player to optionally use a dance pad instead of traditional controllers or keyboard controls.Deb0092July 31, 2015 at 1:36 pmThe long awaited release!!!\ncool man!!spyglius25August 3, 2015 at 12:17 pmNope, it’s useless without the multiplayerawesomeAugust 17, 2015 at 12:25 pmawesome!! been waiting for thisthanksrahimAugust 21, 2015 at 1:05 pmhow to opendjozhedebeljanAugust 31, 2015 at 12:32 pmthnx…will be seeding!skillszonSeptember 7, 2015 at 12:38 pmIt works without any issueassociatedlemonSeptember 16, 2015 at 12:11 pmgreat,.awesome workkkkkkkk……………darioSeptember 21, 2015 at 11:51 ami hope it wordsvirtualmatrix258September 28, 2015 at 12:19 pmthank you!cedhxcxOctober 5, 2015 at 12:37 pm*-* Good [email protected]@!! but next do not take the language Portuguese =[BjdmOctober 9, 2015 at 3:22 pmExcellent Torrent.NO stress just download and enjoy.Best RegardsEnalaCDrorvOctober 12, 2015 at 6:56 amthnxsteaveOctober 14, 2015 at 3:28 pmworks perfectli just follow instruction thankshavingOctober 15, 2015 at 1:24 pmHey Guys Im having a little trouble, when i go to start the game it says im missing D3COMPILER_43.dll.

It’s been installing for 14 hours. Such a long installation time suggests that the installer doesn’t actually do what it is supposed to do most of the time. Some say a bitcoin miner is in it.

      "Invisible, Inc. is a turn-based tactics stealth video game incorporating elements of roguelike gameplay, developed by Canadian independent studio Klei Entertainment. In the game, the player acts as the remote operator for an espionage agency that has come under attack from multinational corporations, and directs agents in covert missions, acquiring resources and support in order to enable relocation of the agency's computer system to a safe haven within a limited amount of time.\nThe game was available for Early Access for Microsoft Windows and OS X from January 2014, a Linux build was later released. The full version was released for Windows, OS X, and Linux on May 12, 2015. A PlayStation 4 version was released on April 19, 2016, while a version for iOS devices was released on October 6, 2016.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game is a turn-based tactics based-game inspired by X-COM, with emphasis on stealth and espionage. In each playthrough, the player takes on the role of an agent handler for covert operations and has three days to prepare for their final mission. This is done by performing various missions across the globe to retrieve information, valuables, equipment and personnel, keeping cognizant of the amount of time taken for travel and missions within that three day period. The player selects two agents to perform these missions to start, and may be able to free other agents during missions; should one agent die during a mission, they remain dead for the remainder of the runthrough unless dragged to the exit by another agent, while if all agents die, the game is over. The mission details and location layouts are procedurally generated for each run through, featuring a variety of objectives, obstacles, and difficulty.\n\nMissions are played out in a turn-based manner. Each agent under the player's control has a limited number of action points each turn that allow them to move, open/close doors, take out guards silently, or perform other covert tasks. Additionally, the player may need to collect power to be able to use \"Incognita\", the hacking interface that allows them to disable alarms and security cameras or remove locks on safes. Once the player has completed their turn, any enemy forces move, and in most locations an alarm level is raised; with higher alarm levels, new security forces and threats will arrive, making the mission more difficult. Certain stations can let the player purchase upgrades or equipment for the agents to help in the mission, using collected in-game money. The objective of the mission depends on the facility type being infiltrated, usually requiring the player to retrieve a specific item from a secure location and escape, stealing as much money and equipment as possible along the way.\nThe game has a larger meta-game aspect, in that as they play and complete certain goals, they can unlock different agents with different skill sets or new default equipment to begin missions with in future playthroughs.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game is set in year 2074, after megacorporations have overthrown the world's national governments and taken control. Invisible Inc. is a private intelligence agency providing services to corporations, performing infiltrations using field agents and a sophisticated AI system known as Incognita.\nAt the start of the game, Invisible Inc. is compromised, which leads to the headquarters as well as most agents and assets being lost, with only the agency's leader, two agents, the player, Monst3r, and Incognita escaping. Incognita can only be hosted in extremely powerful computer systems and cannot survive outside of them for more than 72 hours, so it becomes the agency's task to use that time to prepare for their final mission, where they will try to infiltrate the enemy's headquarters to access the computer system and insert Incognita. But, when she becomes uploaded it turns out she has been planning to exterminate the megacorporations, and ends with her using satellites (equipped with orbital lasers) to destroy their headquarters, killing thousands of people in the process. Incognita defies her removal from the new host computer and allows the agency's leader to leave unharmed.\n\n\n== Development ==\nInvisible, Inc. was announced on July 2, 2013, in an interview with Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Nathan Grayson. A preview of the alpha version of the game was shown at the September PAX Prime 2013 expo. After playing the preview, Grayson commented that the game was very early in development, but that he \"really enjoyed\" his session with the game.The game was originally titled Incognita but was renamed to Invisible, Inc. after developer Klei Entertainment found the new title was better received during focus testing. The name remains as part of the game as \"Incognita\" mode used to interact with the various electronic systems.\nAn alpha version of the game entered Early Access in January 2014. The game was added to the Steam Early Access program on August 20, 2014, and fully released on May 12, 2015. The game was released on the PlayStation 4, including the Contingency Plan content, on April 19, 2016. An iOS version of the base game was released on October 6, 2016, with plans to bring the downloadable content later.Downloadable content (DLC) for the game, titled Invisible, Inc. Contingency Plan was released on November 12, 2015. The DLC adds new agents, mission difficulty levels, missions, enemy types, weapons and items to the main game, in addition to an extended campaign.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nInvisible, Inc. was named as a finalist for the Excellence in Design and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize for the 2015 Independent Games Festival.\nInvisible, Inc. received positive reviews upon release. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PC version of the game 82% based on 24 reviews and 82/100 based on 45 reviews. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
      "Take control of Invisible's agents in the field and infiltrate the world's most dangerous corporations. Stealth, precision, and teamwork are essential in high-stakes, high-profit missions, where every move may cost an agent their life.Character selection: Start with any of the 10 unlockable agents in the game, plus 6 agent variants, and 6 starting programs to crack corporate security.Deep customization of builds: each play through is different as you create your own strategy using agents, items, augments and programs, and adapt to your surroundings.Randomly generated world: locations, threats, and loot are randomly generated so each playthrough is vastly different and you’ll never get complacent.Choose your own game mode: with 5 different game modes and extensive custom generation options, each player can play the way they prefer.Fully animated cutscenes and voice over: with hundreds of lines of voice over, great animation, and fully animated cutscenes, we didn’t spare any expense to make an immersive experience.I already gave it a Game of the Year award.10/10 – DestructoidThis is a game anyone who cares for tactics, espionage or just good times on a PC really needs to check out.YES – KotakuYou should buy Invisible, Inc. because, like I said, I think it’s the best turn-based strategy game to come out in years.

      "I might buy this one brand new. I can't afford to, but damn I want to. At least this is an attainable price point for me. Can't freakin' wait!Steam sale apparently with 2 weeks so you should get 25-30% offlooks interesting might have to check it out once I'm done with the witcher.Approximately how long is a full run of '72 hours'?6 campaigns? Watching the playthrough of the first level it goes from 72 hours before the level to 60 after, so basic math equates to 6 x 12 hours = 72.I am actually wondering how much time it will take to play a full campaign. So I guess using that video as a guide we have 6 missions to use up the 72 hours plus the final level. That level including some setup we 12 minutes so that would only be giving about an hour and a half - two hours of play time.\nSo I would assume that the later levels get harder and bigger as you move further into the game otherwise it seems really short, even for a rogue-like game.I've been playing it via Steam Bigscreen on the TV all weekend. Sunday night there ended up being four people providing advice on how to progress. We spent a good 20-30hrs playing it and I definitely intend to play some different mash-ups. I wouldn't recommend maxing every available option though; its ridiculous.Can't wait to start Hard. Died a couple playthroughs on Medium. Definitely go Beginner for you first run through.Coming to PS4!I kinda wish this was a \"real\" game (I hope you know what I mean by that). I'm intrigued (pun!) by the premise and aesthetic but things like tile-based, turn-based mechanics really break my immersion. I couldn't get in to X-COM for similar reasons.You mean “real-time”?There’s plenty of other “time your run so guards aren’t looking” games out there. This sounds AWESOME to me.\nI love turned based games though, so each to their own.Console releases please!Please log in or register to gain access to this feature.",

      "By\nNick Capozzoli\n2015-05-14T06:11:29.133ZReviewEngrossing tension between empowerment and disempowerment, greed and fear, across an eminently replayable system.The spy movie, as the critic Brian Phillips pointed out a few years back, is at its heart a fantasy about tourism. The spy skips all the fussy details of travel—the discomfit, the bewilderment, the checked baggage restrictions—and cuts right to the landmarks. They know all the roads intuitively; they’re always fluent in the language. And if the spy of popular media is a fantasy tourist, then the hacker is a virtual one: ducking through the back alleys of cyberspace and turning the enemy’s tools against them with engineering jiu-jitsu. They never miss a semicolon, or spend an hour refreshing Stack Overflow.For the elite hacker-spies of Invisible, Inc., the act is so ironed out that it’s almost frictionless. They beam straight into the inner sanctums of evil zaibatsus like they came directly from the USS Enterprise. Another button press, and they’re in the network wreaking havoc—assuming control of computer terminals, surveillance cameras, and security drones. It all feels too effortless, at first, as your agents trade off turns with the enemy guards, spending action points to sneak around and override their systems. And then a momentary lapse forces your hand and you kill a guard, which raises the alarm level, which activates a new camera, which catches one of your characters dead to rights, resulting in a miniature fox hunt that sends the alarm level even higher, calling in heavier armored guards right next to your first character, who just used their last bullet to kill that first guard, and you know what? Let’s just hit the rewind button before this gets really out of hand.It all starts when the Invisible crew is raided by a global trust of militarized megacorps. The team is scattered and shaken, but sets about clambering back into the fight with the help of an omniscient artificial intelligence named Incognita. Incognita can only function on backup power for 72 hours (or whatever time is pre-specified in the exhaustively customizable options menu), so the agents go on a global pillaging campaign, swiping as many corporate assets as they can, culminating in a grand coup d’mainframe to reinstate their AI.Enter, the spy-as-tourist. Prospective missions crop up on a world map a-la XCOM: Enemy Unknown, offering varied rewards in exchange for time against Incognita’s countdown. Do you shlep all the way to eastern Russia for a difficult rescue mission, knowing it will cost you twelve (scaled down) hours? Or do you plow through a string of Mediterranean headquarters nearby that promise lightly guarded cash, weapon caches, and powerful cybernetic implants? It sounds quaintly romantic—abstracted as it is—the cyber spies globetrotting in their personal jet, collecting gadgets.But the spies are also hackers, and hackers are fettered to the tools of their trade. Nobody hides their server farms at the Eiffel Tower or the Taj Mahal. Consequently, a given level in Invisible, Inc. looks about the same as any other: a warren of grid-based conference rooms floating in a void, whether in Dublin or Dubai. The utilitarian surroundings spoil some of the fantasy—imagine Neo never escaping The Matrix, doomed to crouch-run between cubicles in perpetuity.The modular design does serve an end, however. Invisible, Inc.’s levels are procedurally generated, shuffling up hallways, security, objectives, and extraction points so that no two playthroughs are alike. The resulting unpredictability buoys the game’s stealth, dissuading players from the rote memorization that’s always been anathema to the genre. Take the previous hypothetical, with its exponentially increasing comedy of disasters. It might have been avoided, had I saved a single action point on my turn so my character could “peek” through a door prior to throwing it open. Even spotted, there’s a saving chance to hop to an immediately adjacent tile if it breaks line of sight. Or I might dive another character towards a nearby terminal and siphon some power, which can be used to turn a turret that will kill the guard. The gambit might pay off, but it also might cause delays or unforeseen complications that cause me to miss out on a chance at the enemy’s vault, or even lose two agents instead of one. Or maybe I burn a precious “rewind” chance to reset the turn and try a new permutation?Risk and reward are gauged, then a door opens, a new variable walks in, and they have to be gauged anew. Many of these variables are ushered in by the alarm system, which begins ticking up from the first turn—even if the player remains undetected. After a few turns, or an unstealthy blunder, the alarm ratchets up, introducing new layers of security on enemy electronics and additional patrols, or even broadcasting the location of the player’s agents. The effect’s a bit like having a downward slope underfoot—you might be able to ignore it, but if you trip, you’re going to roll for a while.On anything but Beginner, Invisible, Inc. poses a steep challenge, and any given run through the campaign can come crashing to a halt if things suddenly get out of hand like that. When it happens, almost everything’s lost for good, in the spirit of a roguelike (save files even wipe upon completion of the campaign). But a few abilities remain, like the ones which govern Incognita’s hacking abilities, and accumulated cash is banked towards new agents, many of whom completely upend the manner of play. “Internationale,” for example, can remotely activate the terminals that power up Incognita’s hacking interface, even from behind walls. That’s the power problem solved, almost singlehandedly. I find it hard to go without her.They’re a captivating rogues’ gallery, with the elegantly tapered musculature and Easter Island heads that Klei favors, and wonderfully haughty, disinterested British accents. Of Decker, a noir Blade Runner in a trenchcoat, Central, the M of the group says, “The 20th century thing is an unfortunate affectation,” affecting dame Judy Dench’s Bond matriarch in the process. It’s a pity that they rarely speak, and outside of Central, Incognita, and a rogue merchant named—ugh—”Monst3r,” they have little bearing on the terse plot that strings the procedurally generated levels together. I’d have liked a chance to know them better, beyond the rap sheets we’re given.“Isn’t that why we travel in the first place … how we’re able to know each other at all?” Phillips poses, and, “to be a tourist is to be a spy with his cover blown.” The great success of Invisible, Inc. is that it uses that prospect like a lingering tension. A wall hides an inconvenient guard, a firewall hides a malicious script, and suddenly the plans have changed, and it’s no longer possible to be a dispassionate spy, memorizing patrol routes and waiting out alarms. The team is strung out, the guards are closing in, the plane is leaving. Who makes it?What is it? A turn-based stealth strategy game with a cyberpunk spin.

      "The 2001 remake of Ocean’s Eleven left me confused, enthralled, and feeling the need to upgrade my threads. This is the goal for most heist movies: the audience should be as dazzled as the in-film mark, hoodwinked but with begrudging respect. The missteps should be uncloaked as part of the plan all along, with every twist meticulously reflected in the quick cuts and unexpected reveals.Spy films are more methodical. At least, the ones that draw from actual spooks are, as opposed to action movies merely fitted with espionage (your James Bonds and Ethan Hunts, for example). Real world intelligence-gathering is low-key by design and necessity; if there are gunshots and explosions then people will notice, and the last thing an intelligence officer wants is undue attention. Thus, films like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy are couched in stairwells and drawing rooms with coded conversations that no one in or out of the film should trust as truth. The Americans are playing the long game, scheming and counter-planning, getting dirty only when necessary.Invisible, Inc. captures the thrill and tension of a spy movie in a custom heist-film tuxedo. Developed by Klei (who, in the interest of full disclosure, employs former Kill Screen editor Chris Dahlen) and now officially released after a successful early access period, every mission of this game drops you in the soup with few skills, fewer friends, and no plan. These are all vital elements to successful corporate intrusion, and you’ll pick them up as you go along, but you’ll never be over-prepared. There’s no danger in having the upper hand, and in this game the charge comes from wiggling out of tight spots. Many of those pickles will be of your own design.At its foundation, Invisible, Inc. marries hide-and-seek stealth with the traditions of current roguelikes, including random level generation and a lack of a quick reset option. This game shines at the higher difficulties, because the consequences are legit and every step carries that much more weight. Mistakes must be lived with, which puts success on a spectrum: Getting through a level undetected feels good, but doing so by the seat of your pants after wrangling out of a royal fuck-up is a rush. Invisible, Inc. blends Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy Tactics, but you are forced to reckon with your own failure. It’s the planning and execution montage splayed out by the second, with no safety net, bubbling with the anxiety of strategies overwrought and ad-hoc.As the player, you’re an offsite operator for a team of spies looking to settle up with the coalition of mega-corps that torched your headquarters. The art direction is fantastically sharp, fluid, and moody, with charming voice work and pithy sound effects that do not wear out their welcome. It has the feel of a John le Carré novel set in the world of Blade Runner, visually if not plot-wise. The narrative is a bit thin but it’s ok, a knotty political thriller isn’t promised and therefore not missed. Invisible, Inc. is a quiet but intricate game meant to be parsed and read through the playing, one that steps back when you want to think and forward when plans get hectic.You need to do the slow, methodical work of undercover stealth: Peek through doors and hack cameras to see what’s going on, avoid guards rather than confronting them for as long as possible. A knocked out soldier soon wakes up angry and a dead one instantly raises the alarm, which already rises turn by turn and jumps up every time you’re spotted. But since Invisible, Inc. is turn-based, you can take your time figuring out your paths and winding through the blind spots, rushing only when tactically feasible, passing or raiding vaults and safes as the situation permits. Pressure rises as you wait to figure out sentry paths and find your target and escape routes, so while you can consider your move for as long as you’d like, you can’t just stroll through the blind spots at a leisurely pace.As is the nature of random generation, sometimes the level is stacked against you; the fun comes from dealing with a bum hand. Invisible, Inc. demands the player transcend their own expectations. Yes, occasionally an elite unit will be patrolling right in front of the teleporter out of Dodge, so you can’t drag your unconscious teammate through without getting shot. Meanwhile the other guards you put to bed are shaking it off and breaking patrol to find you. But you’re out of backsies, so while it wasn’t pretty, you figured out how to sell a taser for some med gel to get Deckard on his feet, and you all zipped past the final patrol before he turned around. Any heist you can stroll away from is a successful one, and the game rarely disallows for creative thinking.It’s sublime when a plan comes together, but squirming out of a nasty mess takes a higher degree of patience and pressurized innovation. Anyone can play a map enough to have near-omniscience on a level’s layout and just waltz through with nary an eyebrow raised. Invisible, Inc. doesn’t deny you this experience at the beginner level, but it’s more rewarding when played without a net (and it also allows you to customize challenges if you truly can’t deal with an anxiety-inflating alarm, for example). Play spy and nimbly case the joint, then follow up as a hard-knocking crew left to bungle your best laid schemes and tango with the consequences.",
      "Invisible, Inc. is a turn-based tactical game with a focus on stealthy gameplay. It was created by Klei Entertainment, the makers of Don't Starve and was originally released on Mac and Windows back in May of 2015. It finally made the leap to iOS this month and was well worth the wait.THE PLOTThe game is set in the year 2074 after a host of too-big-to-fail mega-corporations have done away with national governments and taken direct control of the world's affairs. These corporations have immense assets and armies of security. Invisible, Inc. on the other hand is an intelligence and espionage agency and the game's namesake. It has attracted the ire of the corporate hegemony which took the nearly unprecedented step of pooling assets to put an end to the agency. The game starts as the Invisible Inc. headquarters is being overrun, most of its agents killed, and its assets seized or destroyed. All that remains is the agency's indomitable leader, two agents, a powerful computer AI known as Ingonita, and you.You play as a handler of covert operatives in the field. You must guide your two-agent team through a series of missions to build up the assets and experience necessary to infiltrate a corporate facility and implant Incognita in their computer systems. Apparently her housing in exile isn't up to snuff, and is kind of like putting a beluga whale in a coy pond. Bottom line: she will not survive more than 72 hours without an upgrade. There aren't many suitable locales, and the risk is worth the potential rewards for an agency with few options.If this all sounds a bit like the plot of all the Mission: Impossible movies, well, that's probably intentional. In fact, go ahead and queue up the M:I theme song to listen, it should serve as the perfect ambience for the rest of this review. The world and narrative may not be super original, but it doesn't have to be. It does a nice job of setting the stage and applying a sense of urgency to the overall campaign.THE GAME PLAYInvisible, Inc. is a turn-based game and uses action points (AP) for each of your agents much like in Templar Battleforce. The game is played on a grid where you have a birds-eye view of the corridors, rooms, doors, furniture and of course your agents. Moving one square on that grid costs one AP. Other actions, like peaking around a corner, also cost AP. Some actions, like opening or closing doors, do not cost any AP (quick tip: always close doors, it can take away security line of sight to your agents). You assign actions for your agents and then end your turn at which point the enemy takes its turn.Decision making is key in Invisible, Inc. and you have to decide the best path forward. There is no way you can force your way through missions and hack and slash enthusiasts need not apply. You need a good game plan and teamwork between agents, coordinated by you, their operator, is critical. As you encounter enemy security, for example, you have a choice: engage or evade. Your agents start with a neural disrupter, which can knockout a guard for a few turns, but when they come to they are on the alert and start seeking you out. Alternatively, you can attempt to sneak around guards. Sneaking in general is a ton of fun and I especially enjoy stealthing up right behind a guard and pickpocketing his access card and credits (the game's currency).Attacking is often unavoidable and ups the game's security level. Security level increases each turn as corporate security becomes aware of your presence. As the security level increases things become more difficult: firewalls get harder to break and additional security guards arrive to track down your agents.Agents have four different skills: Speed, Hacking, Strength, and Anarchy. Speed ties directly to how many action points the agent has. Action points are good the more you can do each turn the better. Hacking is also critical and is the ability to make use of Incognita to turn off security cameras, break through computer firewalls, and hijack computer terminals. When you access Incognito you flip to a different screen that provides a view of the electronic equipment within range with which you can tamper. Handily, it also shows you the position of security guards and is a pretty clear way to find the exit as well. Hacking costs power and you gain power at the beginning of each turn or by hijacking an enemy computer terminal.Strength affects the agent's ability to drag around unconscious guards and carry more items on their person. The latter becomes pretty handy when a mission objective is to recover stuff. Anarchy is all about the ability to pickpocket guards. The better you are at it, the more of their credits you can pilfer.There are five different levels of aptitude for each skill and your agents will start out with areas of speciality. As you play, you're able to level up agent skills using credits. You steal credits from the corporations and their security personnel. Credits can also be used to buy new and better tech (weapons, equipment, augmentations, etc.).  Improving agents and dropping them into the next job is really fun, and Invisible Inc. definitely has the \"just one more mission\" thing going for it as a result.The pacing of Invisible, Inc. is excellent and once you get the hang of it you can move quickly through turns. The speed-of-play dovetails nicely into the urgency of the overall narrative. In each mission you have a primary objective. It might be to find important information or steal an object of great value. It might be to rescue an important captive or just steal some credits. The objective drives your game plan, but even once you've secured your primary objective getting out alive is often the most difficult, and most fun, part of a mission. Things can go sideways in a hurry and staying one or two rooms ahead of the pursuit and narrowly escaping a tough spot provides a huge thrill.These thrills are frequent as the game is plenty challenging. For this review, I played on the \"beginner\" setting and had my hands full until I got a better handle on things. I got to the point where I felt like I could up the ante on the difficulty and have little doubt the higher settings will provide an appropriate challenge for any player.THE VERDICTInvisible, Inc. is well designed, looks great, and plays even better. It is fast-paced and exciting with a tightly woven, if fairly familiar, narrative. If you loved XCOM and Templar Battleforce you'll love this game. If you are a fan of turn-based tactical games this is absolutely in your wheelhouse. If you dig high-tech, high-stealth, full-of-thrills gameplay go buy this now on iOS.A super stealthy, strategy game-of-the-year contender.\"Log in to join the discussion.",
      "A few months ago, Klei Entertainment released Invisible Inc., the result of combining mind-boggling XCOM-like turn-based mechanics, and the jittery feeling of sneaking past guards of Mark of the Ninja. I played it, I reviewed it, and I loved it — albeit its disengaging characters and lack of sense of progression. It juggles with the discrepancy between the need to invest in your characters throughout the campaign, and the futility of such investment, as they can die at any moment and force you restart the campaign from zero. No moves can be undone within a turn, and repeating a turn comes at a high cost. This is why the game is better relished in low difficulties, where one wrong move in the later levels doesn’t entail the loss of many hours of progress. It isn’t only a game where the mechanics were the focus, but also its story, which meant that its roguelike design may not be the friendliest approach — as a side note, maybe a look at Zombi’s attitude towards permadeath would be appropriate here, which merges the orthodox approach to narrative with concepts seen in roguelikes.But the past is the past, and now Klei intends to pump some life into their game, and they’re doing so by turning everything up to eleven. Contingency Plan brings about more agents, more enemies, more gadgets, weapons, alarm levels, longer campaign, side missions… It is difficult to not see this as a desperate strife to enhance the game’s lifespan, and one that doesn’t succeed in all aspects. This move comes from the same developers that just announced their second expansion for Don’t Starve; one that, much like the first one did, is expected to give new twists and turns to the game’s universe and mechanics. Not only that, but they went through the hassle of forging a multiplayer version of that game, dubbed Don’t Starve Together.We can recognise that their reputation precedes them, and unfortunately, Contingency Plan doesn’t meet the expectations. Unquestionably, a game based around gathering and crafting like Don’t Starve can be more versatile when it comes to creating new content, but this doesn’t hold up as an excuse for such a categorically shallow DLC. Let me be clear about this: the new content lets me have my druthers in the same way I can add both Oreo and Kit Kat to my XL fro-yo for 50p more. It is not a caramel-flavoured yogurt, or a new set of Japanese sweets to add; it’s the ‘same-o, same-o’ we had before, over-cluttered with choices that become more and more pointless the more you take them in.One aspect I discussed in my review is the strange mix between permadeath and a narrative-driven game — the story is shite, yes, but there is some story —, and ironically, it is the one that suffers the most from Contingency Plan. It doubles up the length of the campaign up to 8 or 9 hours, increasing the difficulty of the missions accordingly. This transforms a rather demanding campaign to an extenuatingly laborious and utopian one. If the hardest difficulties were only achievable by those very dedicated players, now it’s become downright impossible for the common folk, as there are twice as many occasions to mess it up. What’s more, if you’re as bad as me, you’ll opt for the lowest difficulty, in which your agents are extremely overpowered and resourceful two thirds into the story. The last 3 hours of game are a repetitive chain of levels that widen the gap more and more between you and the enemy, and thus reducing the challenge.It seems to me that the main problem for this discrepancy in difficulties is the possibility of redoing a level, only available in the lowest. If an agent dies during a level, the game’s difficulty ramps up, whereas if you can redo the level, the agent will more likely make it out alive and with juicier upgrades. Adding more and more content just accentuates these differences. All in all, Contingency Plan doesn’t fix any issues or break the game; rather, it seems to be more catered to those proficient at it, and that can take that leap of difficulty and crave a bigger and longer challenge. More content is always appreciated, but to me, it became a bit superfluous and ‘too much’. However, I can acknowledge that it can either improve or worsen the game, depending on which end of the ‘Type of Player’ scale you stand. Personally, I just don’t have the patience.Contingency Plan doesn’t fix any issues or break the game; rather, it seems to be more catered to those proficient at it, and that can take that leap of difficulty and crave a bigger and longer challenge. More content is always appreciated, but here it becomes superfluous, as it adds no interesting twist to the gameplay..Jammy since birth, not so much in videogames. I will rant if you let me.

      "In the newly released graphical adventure game Post Mortem, you play as Gustave MacPherson, a former private eye. Gustave is an American expatriate living in Paris and trying to eke out a living as a painter. When contacted about a strange murder by a stereotypically mysterious dame named Sophia Blake, he cracks easily. Though you, as Gustave, are allowed to say \"no\" to the would-be client, eventually you'll have to take the case...unless you actually want to pace back and forth in Gustave's tiny studio for the remainder of the game. The fact that you have the option to turn down Ms. Blake's offer is interesting and shows one of Post Mortem's best features: Specifically, the choices you make while conducting your investigation actually affect the game, presenting new puzzles, new solutions, and new destinations based on what you do and when you do it. While the system doesn't work so well in this instance, in other situations it does, and in one particularly inspired section of the game, it actually, single-handedly, keeps Post Mortem from being just another rote adventure game. Unfortunately, the game doesn't generally put enough emphasis on its own interesting features, and the rest of the time, it's just another formulaic adventure.The inspired sequence mentioned above involves a scene in which Gustave tracks down a primary suspect in the beheading of two American tourists. He and the suspect sit and talk, and the game suddenly places you in the role of the suspect. You control his actions on the day of the murder, and what you do affects what information is available to Gustave once the flashback ends. It's an interesting take on the normal investigative adventure game formula and is one that may lead you to believe the whole game will be a series of similar flashbacks. Unfortunately, this is the only time it happens, and the rest of the game is just a typical series of sealed doors with mysterious machines for locks.Not that there are many sealed doors. For an adventure game, Post Mortem has a notable lack of traditional puzzles. There are only a handful, and most of them are fairly easy, with two exceptions. One puzzle, the game's best, involves deciphering an alchemical formula and then using it to create a mysterious compound. It's fairly difficult, if only because it requires several layers of deciphering to even understand what you need to do. But it makes sense in the context of the game, a rare thing in modern adventure games. On the other hand, Post Mortem also includes what may be the single most boring puzzle ever devised--one that requires you to slowly drag a lit candle over a painting over and over again until hidden images reveal themselves.This lack of puzzles indicates another problem with Post Mortem: It's surprisingly short. The only things that keep it from being less than 10 hours long are the lengthy dialogue sections, which unfortunately can't be sped up or skipped. The dialogue is decent, but occasionally you're given access to information that you haven't learned yet. When you first meet with Sophia Blake, for instance, you can ask about her \"sister's murder\" before you even learn anything about the murder. This is a minor problem, though. The major problem is that the voice acting is plodding, as if everyone involved agreed that repeated and stilted pauses would make everyone sound more dramatic. Seriously--characters speak so slowly they make William Shatner sound like a hyperactive auctioneer at a county fair. Moreover, both the French and American characters speak with the same sort of fake, overenunciated English (and, strangely, everyone pronounces the word \"heir\" as \"hair\"). The voice acting is poor in general--including elderly women that sound exactly like young women trying to sound like elderly women and failing--but, sadly, that's almost an expectation in contemporary adventure games. Neither are the graphics noteworthy. The backgrounds are muddy and dull, and the characters move like marionette footage set on an endless loop. Though they look fine, after watching their standard animation--touch eyeglasses, wave hands, repeat--a dozen or so times, it becomes tiring.The plot, too, offers nothing unexpected. Though it starts off like a typical tale of murder and betrayal like The Maltese Falcon, it eventually turns to the supernatural. It would be a spoiler to tell you the story unfolds to reveal a connection to the Knights Templar, if it weren't for the fact that every adventure game set in Europe since Circle of Blood has unfolded to reveal a connection to the Knights Templar. Post Mortem is self-conscious enough to make a joke about typical adventure game plots (at one point Gustave sarcastically asks someone about lost civilizations), but it apparently isn't self-conscious enough to avoid these cliché plots itself.Hopefully Post Mortem's developers will take note of their game's particular strengths and incorporate them in another game that will elaborate on the innovative ideas that are presented here but not explored. Post Mortem is a decent adventure game, and fans of the genre who are easily pleased will find it simple and short, but entertaining while it lasts. But it's the occasional appearance of something different--the alternate solutions, the flashback through another's eyes--that makes most of Post Mortem seem dull and typical in comparison.We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.Use your keyboard!",
      "There´s a lot of awesome Hack and slash RPG´s out there. So if you´re making a game like that. Then it better be really good. Or else you´re just going to end up in the shadows of the bigger names on the market. But i tried to play Phigames and Digital Tribe Games Hack n slash/RPG/roguelike game “TinyKeep” with an open mind.Well, “TinyKeep” started of pretty well. As i got rather impressed by the games graphics (the rag doll physics are pretty hilarious), humor and really talented voice actors. But things went down hill after that.And please allow me to explain why. The whole thought behind “TinyKeep” is that you (a prisoner) will try to breakout of a prison. And each and every stage is randomly generated.That´s nice right? Well, yeah. But here´s the thing. The pattern is pretty much the same throughout the game. And even though you get to pick your own hero at the very start of the game (gender, cloths ect). There´s not all that much room for customizing a unique and creative hero. And to my knowledge, there´s not all that many weapons or armors either.I can´t say that i enjoyed the fighting style either. As it´s very repetitive and boring for most part. Then we got the most annoying feature of “TinyKeep”. Which would be the fact that there´s no save function (IF Phigames haven´t changed that) in “TinyKeep”. So if you die, then you will have to start all over from the very first level of the game.And that becomes a huge problem further on in the game. As the difficulty setting becomes almost impossible after stage 5. Imagine yourself playing L4D2 on the hardest difficulty, and you get wave after wave of infected and special infected coming your way. But all you got is a lousy gun.Because everyone and everything is out to get you in “TinyKeep”. And once you reached stage 5, the bosses has become almost impossible to kill (or even to keep your distance from). And if you just make one single wrong move, then you´re history! Oh, did i mention that there´s booby traps everywhere?Then we got the somewhat inflexible map function on top of that (it´s not as flexible as the Diablo map for example).

An astounding trailer gave me no reason to believe otherwise. Now, I have finished the game, and I stand before you a broken man, wishing that I had a can of whitewash in my hand, and the will to use it. But try as I may, as badly as I want every adventure game to sell a million copies and my reviews to make that difference, I can not recommend Post Mortem to you.Let me start by assuring you of one thing: Post Mortem is a beautiful game, an extraordinary visual triumph as good-looking as Syberia. Incredible cut-scenes, amazing facial detail, and generally well-drawn and eye-pleasing backgrounds. If nothing else, Microids has solidified their reputation as having one of the strongest art teams in modern gaming.The game also succeeds, albeit with a few hiccups, in the area that first attracted me: the story. It begins as a relatively simple private-eye mysterious-woman murder mystery, and after a few fairly interesting twists and turns, we've got our hero Gus MacPherson digging into the history of Baphomet and the Templars...hmmm, where have I heard that before? Don't worry, there's nothing derivative about the plot, Microids was careful to not copy that other Templars game whose name escapes me. The story is surprisingly ambitious, not content to be as unsubstantial as most adventures are. Still, it's hardly groundbreaking; Lost Files of Sherlock Holmes (now ten years aged, still revolutionary) has a much more complex and involved plot. Still, the story is above average, properly paced, and leads up to a satisfying resolution (actually, there are three substantially different endings).Here, sadly, is where we run into the problems; even the greatest story ever can be told incompetently. I've read a few other Post Mortem reviews (which I generally try to avoid doing before writing a review) just to see what other writers were saying about the game's dialogue. The strongest wording I could find was \"the dialogue could use a bit more zip.\" Let me put it in the strongest terms I can think of: the dialogue in Post Mortem is absolutely, positively awful. Ghastly, dreadful, cringe-inducing...I'm still not sure I'm getting the message across. After ten minutes of pondering, I can't think of any reason not to say that, at least as high-profile commercial adventures are concerned, Post Mortem has the worst dialogue I've ever suffered through.Part of the problem clearly comes from the fact that the game was translated into English by non-native English speakers. How anyone ever thought this was okay is just beyond me, but there it is. Mysteriously, all contractions have been removed from the translation, so we end up with questions like \"Do not you realize?\" and \"Was not he already here?\" and similar perplexing abuses of an innocent language. The voice actors, who generally give uninterested performances (especially the voice of Gus, who apparently phoned his performance in from the comfort of his bed before going back to sleep), have the good sense to at least read the lines as \"don't\" and \"wasn't,\" but seeing different lines on screen than I'm hearing doesn't make me think much higher of the production job. That's beyond the occasional sentence where the first letter isn't capitalized, punctuation misplacements...this is not what gamers pay money for.It's not just the dialogue that's righteously flawed, it's the entire character interaction system. The dialogue tree system is a nightmare; only one option is shown on the screen at a time (you click on tabs to select others, and then often forget where the one you wanted in the first place is) and dialogue options appear and disappear with no logical connection to the conversation that is taking place. I found it fascinating that I could actually witness the death of one character, and then go to another character and all of a sudden have the dialogue option to ask about the whereabouts of the now-dead character, where I couldn't before. I can't imagine how any reasonable amount of beta testing couldn't have trapped these numerous logic bugs. The game logs all your conversations automatically, a very useful feature, but unfortunately a tragically humorous one as I was able to replay the insanely illogical discussions I was allowed to have with NPCs. The game could have done more to ensure the feasability of conversations if you were not forced to choose every sentence Gus says from a large group of choices, providing you with the means to undermine the flow of any conversation. It's also quite frustrating that there is no way to skip a line of dialogue that you've already heard before. There is, truly, not a single positive element in the character interaction system, and so what we end up with is a very decent story, painfully told.I have no complaints about the interface, familiar to those who have played Amerzone or Road to India, but I can assure you this would have been a more engrossing game in third-person; all the limitations and frustrations of a first-person navigation system are on full display here. The story is often impeded by the barrage of Myst-style puzzles, which are fairly tolerable and reasonably challenging, but just unnecessary at times. People complain about what an easy game Syberia was; is frustration and confusion for an extra hour of playing time really a wise trade?Post Mortem looks great, and I mean great, probably the best cut-scenes I've ever seen. It attempts to tell an intriguing above-average story. Those elements allow me to feel comfortable giving the game two stars. Everything just falls all to pieces in the execution, specifically every element of character interaction (which is 80% of the game). It's frustrating to the point of bafflement at times, to want to care so much about the story, but feel so stifled by the atrocious dialogue and unfriendly interaction system.I so badly want Microids to be successful. They have committed their support to the adventure genre. I would like nothing more than to help their cause by telling everyone to go buy their adventures. I can do that with Syberia, a truly remarkable adventure. But as much as I'd like to see every adventure succeed, the forseeable consequences are far worse if companies start to believe they can produce this sort of product without responsible reviewers informing the fans. There's no reason to give up on this company; the elements of a good game are here, and I have no reason to believe that Microids is not capable of producing a brilliant, well-executed Sherlock-esque detective adventure game, with engrossing dialogue, absorbing characters, and an uninhibited complex story. Post Mortem is most definitely not that game.Post Mortem is available at:Unconscious and near death in a makeshift boat, Kate Walker, the lawyer from New York, is miraculously discovered by a caravan of Youkol before she draws her last breath.

      "Below is the full Post Mortem Interview Game Developer Magazine conducted with SWERY and the Access Games Staff back in August 2010! It’s a great read for any Deadly Premonition fan!Access Games’ Deadly Premonition had a long and difficult development period that was beset by technical problems. The game was dragged from the precipice of cancellation several times and ultimately persevered to become an underground hit. In this candid postmortem, the staff of Access Games describes how a passionate commitment to their game saw them through the production’s highs and many lows.UPDATE 02/01/2014: Following the magazine’s closure in July 2013, GDC Vault compiled an archive and made all past issue freely available for all to enjoy. You can download the entire August 2010 issue there!Vol 17 No 08 August 2010This project began in the early fall of 2004. Looking back, it was more than five and a half years ago. After we released Spy Fiction in late 2003, Access Games wasn’t lucky enough to have the opportunity to work on another original title, and we wasted nearly a year deciding what our next game would be. Of course, it’s possible we only received the chance to make such an uncommon game because we had so long to harge our batteries. The creativity that built up over so many months was about to explode, looking for an outlet to express itself. Our energy found an explosive release in the form of Marvelous Entertainment, and crystallized into what became Deadly Premonition. The process was logical, and you might say that we set out to follow a standard development course. But that course turned out to be more precipitous than we could have imagined, and it was, quite literally, a bloody few years. Numerous obstacles stood in our way: unclear nextgen console specs, the decision to go multi-platform, and the threat of project cancellation. It was all we could do to stand up to the hardships and remain steadfast in our implicit faith that the game would eventually be completed. In the end, I learned that true effort is always rewarded. After pushing this project through, we found a gratifying reception waiting for us in a distant, foreign land.– SWERY (director) & Hitoshi Okamoto (art director)We believe our greatest success in Deadly Premonition was the establishment of our main character. Many different types of protagonists have been created – and loved – in the history of videogames, so our primary mission was to devise a type of hero that had never existed before. DEADLY PREMONITION is essentially a mystery, and although quality peripheral characters are crucial in good mysteries, the main haracter is especially important. I believe players pick up on the fact that while York may appear very handsome, he’s a true eccentric inside. York speaks his mind with no regard for the feelings of those around him while constantly muttering to himself … In other circumstances, it would be no surprise if players grew to dislike him, wondering “Who the hell is Zach?” [York has a second personality, named Zach, living within his mind. There is a strong argument to be made for Zach being “the player.” – ed.]Yet everyone who plays the game seems to love him. Why? Perhaps it’s because players recognize that he’s extremely charming and reliable – a friend worthy of admiration. Of course, we don’t think we gained that recognition for free. There’s an important device at work: the invention of the “Zach as Player” relationship. Agent York pursues his murder investigation in Greenvale, the player munches popcorn in his living room, and Zach is the bridge between them.You might say that the character we were aiming for is established the moment York and the player become true friends, joined through the conduit of Zach. Agent York is a character who only springs into existence with the assistance of the person playing the game … and that turned out to be exactly the new type of hero we were after.We knew going in that a character created with the exclusion of the player just wouldn’t work. Please show York the same love you’ve given countless other video game characters before him. That’s all we – and he- can ask.– SWERYWe spent as much time polishing our storyline and worldview as we did our protagonist. During early development, our setting was much more urban and cynical than the final product. The presentation was also more violent, and decidedly more extreme; I think the one-year gap between original projects may have turned our thoughts toward violence. Our final world came together only after several iterations, and the overcoming of multiple near-cancellations. For the story, I kept as much sense of reality as possible while embellishing it with a somewhat dreamlike milieu. As a result, I believe the sections depicted as eality have a dreamlike feeling, and likewise, the actual dreams are given a sense of realism- we were able to smear the boundary line. There are very few video games so particular about depicting such things, and I think DEADLY PREMONITION may have become a unique example among them.A realistic setting was also completely necessary for bringing this story to life. To build it, I posited three “reals:” “real time,” “real scale,” and “real life.” Implementing these with our limited budget and resources proved to be extremely difficult, but despite a great deal of resistance (even from within the team!), I felt these three concepts were essential.First, to reproduce our five-square-mile town, we visited America for data collection, using measures to determine the width of roads, billboards, and railroad crossings. Second, to depict 24-hour time spans, we calculated weather patterns and the angle of the sun by giving our fictional town a real-world latitude. Finally, we wrote extremely detailed profiles for the townspeople (blood types, birthdays, favorite foods, favorite music, people they disliked, what age they were when they had their first kiss, etc.). While not necessary for the game proper, these were used to create individual 24-hour activity patterns for each character.For example, when the punctual character Thomas rises in the morning, he goes to the toilet, washes his face, and brushes his teeth. If you have a moment while playing, try spying on his apartment- you’ll actually see Thomas performing these actions. Despite not appearing anywhere in the game, we even set the hourly wage for the A&G Diner (about $3.50 per hour, and $25-$30 per day, depending on tips). And, of course, every street in Greenvale has its own name. For a project as rash as this-replicating an entire rural American town from inside Japan- details like these were very important.These factors layer and combine to form the town of Greenvale, and imbue DEADLY PREMONITION with a sense of reality. This approach is particular to our team, and I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it to other developers … but should you get the chance, why not give it a try?– Keiji Teranishi (planner)Music was another focus in DEADLY PREMONITION, and I feel our success in this area was worth the effort. The soundtrack served to further bolster our unique story and world; it may even strike a mood never before heard in games. Our unusual score owes a great deal to our success in helping the composers appreciate the unique aesthetic behind the game. We showed them countless design documents, played music we thought would fit, and sometimes even hummed song ideas – efforts that resulted in the musicians’ understanding of the work.Doing our utmost to convey the game’s aesthetic caused the town of Greenvale to take shape in the minds of our sound team. By the time its citizens began living their daily lives inside our composers’ heads, the melodies of Greenvale were created almost automatically … or so it seemed to me! As proof, I submit “Life Is Beautiful,” a memorable whistling tune that conjures up the feel of a peaceful country stroll, and “York And Zach,” a song that plays during monologues representing the mysterious image of our hero. Both initial demos were given the okay almost immediately, and both were easily worked into the game. I can think of no other songs that match the worldview of DEADLY PREMONITION so perfectly.Several other tracks, however, were created only through much trial and error. Particularly difficult were “Red Tree,” a theme representing madness heard in the Red Room at the outset of the game, and “Miss Stiletto Heels,” Carol’s song, which might be considered DEADLY PREMONITION’s second theme. We were extremely specific about our orders for these tracks – not only for the arrangements, sound levels, and effects, but also aspects as minute as the timing of hi-hats within single bars! The lunatic improvisational section in “Red Tree” also went through numerous takes with different instruments and arrangements before being judged complete.In the end, I believe DEADLY PREMONITION’s music succeeded in adding depth to our unique world and characters. If I were a greedy man, I might say that having a few more tracks would have made it even better!– Keiji TeranishiI feel that the voice work in DEADLY PREMONITION was even more successful than the music. We spent two weeks recording at WebTone Studios, which was in San Jose at the time (the studio has since relocated to Los Angeles). Over 6,000 total lines needed to be recorded, including pre-loaded and streaming samples. That meant we had to get approximately 500 lines in the can every day. Two weeks may seem like a long time, but Access Games is located in Japan, so it was absolutely imperative we lock down everything required in the time allotted. The pressure was extraordinary.We spent those two weeks completely sequestered in the studio … but like Agent York himself, we were also becoming familiar with a new town as we shuttled back and forth from our hotel. These experiences proved invaluable after returning to Japan, so one might say the San Jose trip allowed us to kill two birds with one stone.Before recording began, we showed our actors images of the characters to help create their roles. Although we recorded only after explaining in detail other aspects like the general tone, personalities, and family relationships (Greenvale is full of eccentrics with more than a few quirks), directing the performances turned out to be quite a task. When he had difficulty getting his point across, SWERY occasionally gave direct instructions by getting in the booth and performing lines himself.Among all our fine voices, one actor performed his role exactly as we imagined … and perhaps even better: Mr. Jeff Kramer as York. Jeff brought even greater depth and style to the lead role than Access Games had envisioned, for which we are deeply grateful. Despite having only five days to record some 3,000 lines (he was the lead, after all!), Jeff presented us with a truly brilliant performance.Of course, each of the actors portraying Greenvale’s vibrant characters – George, Emily, Thomas and the rest – turned in wonderful performances. If the fans who play DEADLY PREMONITION get a sense that our characters might be real people living their lives somewhere, then our casting was indeed a success.– SWERYIn trying to compile “Five Rights,” one might expect some talk about fabulous play control or revolutionary graphics. I can’t say either of those were particular successes in DEADLY PREMONITION, so I don’t think such topics would be appropriate for our fifth “Right.”After much internal debate, I came to the conclusion that Deadly Premonition’s greatest “Right” is the fact that we poured our love into the game. That really says it all, so I’m going to use this space to touch on a few aspects we were particularly obsessive about. I hope this text gives you some idea of how much we cared about our game, and indeed how wasteful some of our efforts may have seemed.· Side Missions. I was insistent that the content of our side missions always draw upon aspects of the NPCs’ personalities, thus adding further depth to the world of the game. We built the missions so that players who pursued them might learn more about the personalities and lives of our characters – aspects not revealed in the main story.· Observation And York’s Monologues. Examining certain items in DEADLY PREMONITION (products in stores, posters on walls, objects inside NPCs’ houses) will reveal messages unrelated to the main story, written from the perspective of York speaking to Zach. We created these messages with an emphasis on the question, “If York were actually investigating this object, what sort of impressions would his peculiar sensibility elicit?” For players who want to get the most out of the game, these insights serve to engender further sympathy with York.· Coffee Fortunes. Coffee is a major factor in the main story, but we also included a feature that allows players to view York’s “coffee fortunes” whenever they wished. Like a line in the main story says (“my coffee warned me about it”), we added these interactive “warnings” to bring an extra bit of depth to the concept.· Turn Signals And In-Car Navigation. Although they have no bearing on the game itself, turn signals can be activated on every car. And have you noticed that the car navigation systems are actually functional, and synced to the HUD’s automap? Features like these may seem extraneous, but I truly believe they accentuate the game’s sense of reality.· Conversation While Driving. DEADLY PREMONITION’s game area is five miles square, so a lot of time is spent traveling in cars. What happens on long drives with someone in the passenger seat? Conversation-though not many games have done it. Incorporating the chat feature brought extra realism to these sections of the game. Zach’s presence is also given a chance to shine, as he ceases to become a simple internal monologue and actually enables Agent York’s conversation with the player.· The Greenvale Map. If you look very closely at the full map of Greenvale displayed in the menu screen, you might notice that the town is shaped like Kaysen’s dog, Willie. Willie adds a small accent to the story by appearing with Kaysen, but he is in fact an extremely important character with an intense, unrevealed backstory. We didn’t have a chance to expand on Willie in the main plot, so we secretly concealed a hint in the form of the town map for those who are truly perceptive.– Wataru Nishide (lead level artist) & J’s Kataoka (lead programmer)DEADLY PREMONITION was our first stab at next-generation development, so we began the project astounded by the vast amount of RAM available- much more than any previous consumer hardware had offered.Astonishment gave rise to overconfidence, and eventually to the worst-case scenario: our data management became sloppy.Attempting to work on memory allocation in such a state was very dangerous, but we went into production unaware of the risk. The result was a constant struggle with remaining RAM. This was glaringly evident with the motion data in particular-it ended up occupying a truly massive chunk of memory, which led to system restructuring further down the line.In addition, we set far too many objects in our outdoor scenes, and could not process them all effectively. Dealing with trees and shrubs was especially trying. With that said, cutting too many objects would have reduced the object density of our expansive outdoor map to unacceptable levels, so we had to keep both the optimization of code and the appearance of our world constantly in mind.Similarly, we had entirely too many points of collision enabled, which became a primary factor in processor bottlenecking. This required scrupulous massaging of collision data right up to the end of the project. Lighting and shadows (which we will go into more detail about below) had a huge impact on our cycles as well. Our model forced us to do constant optimization throughout all our code, which led to a huge loss of working time.Many other similar issues can be cited: our water ripple effect, refraction effects, and reflections in mirrors. We do think memory management on this project was an exceptionally useful learning experience, but from the perspective of development, it must be considered a failure. When considering the impact memory allocation has on a game, it goes without saying that this aspect was one of the least successful on the entire project.– Wataru Nishide & J’s KataokaSince this project allowed the use of pixel shaders, we experimented with various types of lighting- specifically, real-time processes like flat lighting, point lights, and spot lights. Unfortunately, we were a bit overzealous with our lighting calculations which resulted in severe processing bottlenecks.Even worse, we based our data formats on the assumption that we would be implementing these different lighting techniques as is, so there were absolutely no lighting effects done with textures; this had a huge impact on later code revisions.Point and spot lights take a heavy toll on graphics rendering, yet brightly lit interiors like the diner had been built with dozens of them. It wasn’t just a question of adjusting the positioningor number of lights; the situation escalated to the point that we had to modify our original resources.Dealing with shadows brought similar hardships. The process of implementing shadows for flat lighting outdoors, point lights indoors, and spot lights used at other specific locations soon became a mighty battle with CPU cycles. A spectacular amount of objects in the vast outdoor areas needed to cast shadows, and because there was little in the way of surface obstructions, the shadows had to appear exceedingly sharp and tight. However, generating such sharp shadows required an enormous amount of VRAM, which simultaneously caused our performance to drop significantly.A great deal of labor was then expended on repetitive testing and adjustment of various shadowing techniques: perspective shadow maps, light space perspective shadow maps, and cascaded light space perspective shadow maps. In the end, we were not only forced to compromise on the sharp shadows we wanted, but the s ituation degenerated to the point that we had to modify almost all our resources. Indoor shadows, too, would be processed redundantly several times if an object were lit by multiple light sources, which also led to serious speed drops.In addition, we faced similar consequences with the self-shadowing on our characters. Selfshadowing can be highly noticeable onscreen, so we strove to render it attractively. Of course, the more high quality our self-shadows became, the more cycles and VRAM were consumed, so we had to work within a delicate balance using jitter textures and the like.These aspects of game development are commonplace today, but at the time, they were tremendously difficult for us. We simply did not have the proper technical know-how yet.– Yutaka Ohkawa (programming support)At the beginning of development, I was convinced that implementing a physics engine (NVIDIA’s PhysX) would allow us to build an exciting, neverbefore-seen world. It was indeed a great boon to the project, driving the behavior of vehicles, the interaction of objects, and even the fluttering of hair. PhysX did allow us a glimpse into a new world. However, the use of a physics engine was not all positive. After incorporating too many realistic physics behaviors into the world of our game, we often found ourselves at their mercy. Game worlds require not-infrequent “cheating,” but physics behavior is brutally honest. In situations where we had to implement convenient cheats-bending the behavior of a character’s prop in a demo scene, or forcing vehicles to navigate properly, for example- physics behavior would conflict.During development, physics behaviors would often be at odds with what we were expecting, so adjusting the parameters to make things look right was rough indeed. This was especially true for characters, whose physics behavior would change any time their motion data was altered. As a result, even parts of the game that had already been approved would immediately break after motion tweaking. The problems manifested in gameplay, of course, but also in demo scenes; the process of correcting them ended up depleting a tremendous amount of time.The processing load for physics operations also proved to be much higher than expected, which was another large miscalculation on our part. Because we originally had everything that could possibly be displayed with a physics engine running through PhysX- hair, clothing, even fishing rods- we failed to produce an enjoyable gameplay environment. In our zeal to pursue individually moving objects, I might say we lost sight of the overall processing picture.To maintain frame rate, it became necessary to optimize; we reduced PhysX actors and adjusted computational loads for each scene individually. However, this made an adversary out of the game’s key eature “freedom” as we had to consider an enormous number of variables when making the adjustments. This process was not quick, and when combined with the aforementioned physics behavior tweaks, it consumed even more of our time and energy.Physics behavior can certainly bring dynamic expression to game worlds, but we learned that it isn’t necessary for everything. Determining exactly when to deploy it is of the utmost importance.– Keiji TeranishiAs I stated above, the music and voice acting in DEADLY PREMONITION went very well, but I cannot say the same for our sound effects or 5.1 surround sound. With nextgeneration hardware, we knew sound specs would improve alongside the graphics. The increase in breadth of expression was attractive, but we were incapable of bringing out the full potential of the hardware at the time.What was the source of this failure? Although there were quality issues with our original sound resources, the biggest problem lies with the fact that Access Games has no sound department. Because we entrust all audio aspects of our games to an outside partner, there is little technical knowledge of sound within the company, which made it tough for us to provide satisfactory quality control. Having turned a blind eye to the problem, we missed the opportunity to try and compensate for the lack of manpower assigned to these issues.Of course, it goes without saying that many development teams lacking sound departments release games with high quality audio. We should have studied and discussed such games, asking ourselves how we might incorporate their quality sound into our product. Indeed, we should have been closely considering measures to amend our faults. Instead, we put everything into the voice and music, which effectively reduced the priority of the sound effects. This is something I deeply regret.And why is that? All audio produced by a game is important-music,sound effects, and voice. Only when the three come together as one can we truly speak of a game’s “sound.”Looking back, I think something could have been done about the schedule/manpower issue and other problems before they became too unwieldy. Avoiding the creation of problems is certainly an important factor in game development. But this project reminded me that when problems already exist- or loom on the horizon- the ability to work as a team and find the best solutions is even more essential.– SWERYI would say that the final and greatest “Wrong” on DEADLY PREMONITION was schedule management. The ideal director is supposed to be able to handle both game quality and project progress, but that was a very difficult proposition for me at the time.I regret forcing my development team to work longer and harder than was necessary. It may be true that the lack of technical expertise covered above contributed to schedule delays, but as the man surveying the entire scene, the greatest responsibility lies with me.I have no intention of criticizing a game I obsessed about deeply, and poured my soul into. Those were good things, in fact. However, managing team motivation so that such games can actually be realized is equally important.On this project, I worked myself to the bone, single-mindedly absorbed in production to the point of blindness, unable to see the people around me- which may be why DEADLY PREMONITION has such a strong sense of “authorship.” In the future, however, I want to forge a game production path in which both schedule and motivation management are properly implemented.» Somehow we overcame a prolonged production schedule, near-cancellation, and countless other hardships to get DEADLY PREMONITION into gamers’ hands. Through the process of producing this game, I learned: never give up. It sounds so obvious, but the meaning is simple: even though you may believe in what you must do, nothing will come to fruition until you actually do it. DEADLY PREMONITION may not have been a huge financial success, but what may be more important is that it was a work that allowed our staff to grow, strengthen their bonds, and better our relationships with all the companies involved. This is not the goal, but the starting line; now, we embark on our next stage in game development.York: “Say, Zach. What do you suppose is waiting for us on the road ahead?

      "A downloadable gameMORTEM is a first person horror game, developed by Nighthood Games.MORTEM DEMO v2.0 is now available on Steam! http://store.steampowered.com/app/585740/You are Timothy Collins. You arrive home late from work and enter your house. At first the silence is so deep, you realise that none of your family is home. But then there's a creak in the walls and a chill down your back. The voices in the dark are almost familiar.Your home reverberates with revenge. MORTEM wants to play with you. Her favourite game is Hide and Seek, but beware, it comes with deadly consequences, and she might not have come alone. Toggle your lights on and off, watch out for her friend Vindicta, run and stop. Explore the house and the woods owned by the prestigious Collins family.The question is, who will survive?Log in with itch.io to leave a comment.Spooky.Honey, it's me, your husband: TOM COLLINS, I'm home! Honey, are you in here? Hello? Anyone? ....Mortem is a work in progress developed by Nighthood Games: albeit a little glitchy, there is some hidden potential (I'm looking at you devs to fix this). In our play through, the only thing that actually worked was turning the flashlight on/off. Would be very interested to play an updated/working demo version.Read the desc people! ;)I would love to make to music for your gameInteresting idea (Very \"Emily Wants to Play\"-esque), but the mechanics mostly just straight-up didn't work when I played it. \"Mortem\", or at least the demonic black doll, only ever pursued once, and was stopped by collision. Afterward, I was able to cheese the game by continually flashing her. Also, the \"hiding in the closet\" mechanic didn't work at all.Would love to see this game get worked on more, and possibly re-visit it another time.Cool looking experience! But was it too easy for me??Stay Rad Everybody!/RadiCarlits not letting me download....https://mega.nz/#!F8NQAYAK!BesyDBLhMTytG5b4MzQWrxNZXveUApsimkMnChlpSCgThank you! <3I'm having the same issue. Could you please fix the download link?Awesome concept but g'dam are there a sh*t ton of bugs lol.Full Gameplay Walkthrough / Jumpscares/ Scary Moments and Much More:had a fun time! glitchy as expected but I see potential!:D DAMN JUMPSCARES GOT ME SO BADDoes this game work with windows 7 because everytime i try to download it from the itch.io app it stops the download and wont downloadVery Cool game I love the concept of it the only thing is that it has alot of bugs but that is to be expected since its only a demo. Overall I Love the game the jump scares got me hahaMortem is the latest game we played on our co-op horror gaming channel Super Horror Bros. It's very scary and actually made us jump far more than many other bigger budget games we've covered recently. The game has alot of potential to be something really great, a good concept, decent visuals and it's definitley scary as you can see in our video link below. The problem is that currently this demo is full of bugs and technical issues, controls are wonky, and you can end up getting caught on walls and doors. Also the jumpscare doesn't really pop properly most of the time. We'll certainly be keeping an eye on this one.So many scares! This game has a lot of promise. The idea is really cool, and has tons of options to expand upon. I like the idea of having the friend play apart in it. I did find a lot of issues with opening doors and such, maybe it was because I was in such a hurry to open the closet, but for a demo it wasn't too much in terms of glitches. I'd like to see how this game develops :DMORTEM is a very cool concept of a game that has a lot of potential! The game is very much along the lines of games like Emily Wants to Play where all you have to do is find Mortem 10 times before 10 minutes passes. The environment and the graphics in the game are absolutely beautiful and character designs are really well done. The soundtrack and sound effects truly make the game even scarier and it's a nice little touch that the music amps up the longer you survive. The light of the flashlight is also spot-on in that you have enough light to see in front you but it doesn't unrealistically light up the entire room. There isn't any story in the game though (I know there's some backstory on the gamepage) and there are still plenty of strange bugs and glitches that can occur where your character doesn't fully enter the closet, yet still somehow manages to survive Mortem. Mortem also tends to get stuck in a doorway, leading you to restart the game. Also the doors in the game don't seem to be fully functional, as I tried to open one door, only to have another open for me. Overall though for a first version of the game, MORTEM is a super scary and fun horror experience that all Indie game fans should try out! I am definitely looking forward to playing the game again once some updates have been made. I made a Let's Play of MORTEM so feel free to check it out and let me know what you think!So I managed to glitch out Mortem at the base of the stairs BUT this game was a blast and I am glad that you shared this!I too played your game! It was nice, but the mouse sens is way to high.More maps please!This looks really good so far! This was one of the scariest horror game I Have played in a while! https://youtu.be/xc8N1benyNYThis was a really cool and creepy horror game. The graphics are well done, the sound design is creepy, and the mechanics are all simple to understand. I really like the concept and atmosphere of this game. Although hardly any of the mechanics worked for me, its only a demo so, but I understood what I needed to do. I like the \"Emily wants to Play\" vibe this game has but with its own little twist. I think this could be a really terrifying experience once the full version is released. I Look forward to seeing what else the developer has in store for the player after this brief demo. I did a video on my experience with the demo if anyone is interested.This game SOOO much fun its just a demo a bit buggy kinda well was for me anyway but still was the most fun I had haha I really have high hopes for this game! :DHey there! Great start to this game! The house and rooms look awesome. One of the bugs I encountered was when I would successfully hide from Mortem in a closet, she would stay in the doorway and there'd be no way for me to escape. Apparently if this happens you can click your flashlight on and off at her while she's stuck and easily win, but that's no fun! The giggling is terrifying though so well done on the audio! Just need to fix the actual chasing & resetting part. Here's my playthrough if you'd like to see:Played the demo, had a bit of an issue with getting stuck in certain doors, as well as issues with activating closets.  Also Mortem bugged out during my last attempt and stopped chasing, allowing me to 'find' her 10 times.  Overall design of Mortem is pretty interesting and graphics and audio are very well done! Definitely excited to see updates!I don't know if other people are experiencing the same problem but clicking the download button on both the webpage and the client seems to not be doing anythinghttps://mega.nz/#!F8NQAYAK!BesyDBLhMTytG5b4MzQWrxNZXveUApsimkMnChlpSCg ;)Thanks a lot, I was having the same problemBuen juego, me ha encantado.

      "So the GameSparks crew are back from GDC (Game Developers Conference) and Game Connection in San Francisco as well as the Microsoft Cloud Gaming Summit in London. We have been super busy the last two weeks in March and into the first 2 weeks of April. With more events coming up like the Update Show in Manchester next week we have been on the road pretty much non stop and it has been a blast.We started with San Francisco for two events ran in the same week. The first was Game Connection where developers all gather for pre scheduled meetings that last 30 minutes. It takes a sort of speed dating format where one side talks about their product whether  it’s a game, middleware or some sort of publishing platform etc, then the other talks about their product and they decide if the could or could not do business together. Each company exchanges their contact details to follow-up on as business is never done in 30 minutes. This format is great for developers looking to find publishers or collaborators on projects.For us it was great as we got to meet a lot of people who are looking into games as a service aka “gaas” or cloud gaming backend solutions specifically. The devs we met either knew exactly what they wanted or were looking for more information on “gaas” as they were having trouble developing their own backend. So GameSparks was ideal for these developers and we got a lot of really positive feedback. It was also good to see that developers are really starting to understand that “gaas” or cloud gaming is definitely the future of game development. Those who understood it and seen the GameSparks platform were generally blown away which gave us more and more confidence with every meeting we took.Game Connection took place from Monday March 17th to Wednesday March 20th in the Sir Francis Drake hotel on Mason street in San Francisco which is right beside Union Square and the Mason Powell cable car line, so basically right in the heart of San Francisco. On the Wednesday we were also in GDC with a booth in the UKIE stand so our team split up for the day. Myself (Jamie O’ Flanagan) and our CEO Griff Parry attended the expo and other meetings scheduled in the Moscone conference centre area while our CMO John Griffin captained the last day of Game Connection.GDC and the days of the expo also had a meeting schedule format which could be done through the meetings.gdconf.com website where you can arrange to meet other exhibitors or expo visitors at a predetermined location, usually one of the exhibitor booths or the registration area. All and all between Game Connection and GDC GameSparks had over 80 scheduled meetings with about another 40-50 impromptu meetings or booth visits from industry professionals who were interested in games as a service. On top of that the various different networking events hosted every evening which are in some cases just as if not more important than the conference itself where we met developers from AAA studios to small indies just chatting about their games and shooting the breeze. They were also a great way to wind down a long day.All in all the week in San Francisco was a success in terms of making the right connections and I would highly recommend Game Connection as a place to go to meet fellow industry professionals who are looking to do business. GDC is also great but the setting is different, it is a lot more hectic with a lot of people there just to see whats new in the industry and what people are making. It is exciting and everyone you see is approachable so it has those benefits but if you have a game and are looking for a publisher, or you are looking for some middleware solutions for your games, or even a publisher looking for games then I’d highly recommend Game Connection. Or do what we did and do both.Until next time.Jamie “The All Spark” O’ FlanaganI wish I could join you in the conference like that. I am social gaming addict not only addictive to the games. I also love to read and search about social gaming industry!Social and Mobile Games\"There is no way we would have been able to meet our launch date trying to roll our own servers and build this functionality ourselves, so we are very grateful to have a partner in developing World War Toons as professional and supportive as Gamesparks\"\"GameSparks saved us a lot of time and provided us with great service and support. We love GameSparks and are sticking with it going forward.\"\"We see GameSparks as an extension to our own internal backend. It offers us rich social features that have been well developed and scale to our needs.\"\" No GameSparks. No Game! We succeeded in shipping WinterForts, to massive volumes of players online, all thanks to GameSparks’ invaluable product and support.\"\"After evaluating every potential backend service provider, we decided to go ahead with GameSparks. They support more Unity3D platforms than any other provider and their database manager, events system and test harness are extremely powerful and flexible to work with, on top of all the other great features they offer in their easy-to-integrate API.\"\"I’ve looked into Google App Engine, Parse, PlayFab, and now GameSparks. I’ve got to say that GameSparks is easily the best of the bunch for games. Plus, features like the Test Harness and SnapShots are a big selling point for me.”“After researching different highly-scalable backend solutions, GameSparks was the clear winner. The platform offers everything we were looking for including an excellent suite of tools for development and testing. Flexibility, rapid iteration and stability are key to us and the team at GameSparks really understands this. Highly recommended.”“From enabling a “preview” area of your services so you can test new features, to the number of service integrations they have out of the box, to their brilliant Cloud Code feature, the GameSparks platform is incredibly comprehensive for what you want in a game backend.”",
      "A toolkit for innovators, rule-breakers and changemakersObject of PlayOften in projects, the learning is all at the wrong end. Usually after things have already gone horribly wrong or off-track, members of the team gather in a “postmortem” to sagely reflect on what bad assumptions and courses of action added up to disaster. What makes this doubly unfortunate is that those same team members, somewhere in their collective experience, may have seen it coming.A pre-mortem is a way to open a space in a project at its inception to directly address its risks. Unlike a more formal risk analysis, the pre-mortem asks team members to directly tap into their experience and intuition, at a time when it is needed most, and is potentially the most useful.Number of PlayersAny, but typically small teams will have the most open dialogueDuration of PlayDepends on the scope of an effort; allow up to five minutes for each participantHow to PlayA pre-mortem is best conducted at the project’s kickoff, with all key team members present and after the goals and plan have been laid out and understood. The exercise starts with a simple question: “What will go wrong?” though it may be elevated in phrasing to “How will this end in disaster?”This is an opportunity for the team to reflect on their collective experience and directlyname risks or elephants lurking in the room. It’s a chance to voice concerns that mightotherwise go unaddressed until it’s too late. A simple discussion may be enough to surfacethese items among a small team; in a larger group, Post-Up or list generation maybe needed.To close the exercise, the list of concerns and risks may be ranked or voted on to determine priority. The group then decides what actions need to be taken to address these risks; they may bring these up as a part of ongoing meetings as the project progresses.StrategyConducting a pre-mortem is deceptively simple. At the beginning of a project, the forward momentum and enthusiasm are often at their highest; these conditions do not naturally lend themselves to sharing notions of failure. By conducting a pre-mortem, a group deliberately creates a space to share their past learning, at a time when they can best act on it.The source of  the Pre-Mortem game is unknown.

      "More than a year ago I blogged (and blogged again later) about my\nongoing github streak.The GitHub streak has since gone on for more than 500 days1, and has been a really enriching experience.Yesterday; I noticed something. I had reached end-game with this exercise. The streak is something I don’t think about anymore,\nand I don’t make any efforts to keep it going. It just … happens. My involvement in open source has reached a level where\nI don’t need to consciously try contributing daily; I have enough interests/responsibilities that the streak is a side effect. This is despite\nmy current internship being at a place where the code I’m working on is not hosted on GitHub (unlike last year). If the streak breaks, I won’t\nparticularly care; and I haven’t been caring for a while now.… I think that’s amazing. Despite me not realizing it at the time, this is the state of affairs that such an exercise would ideally\nlead to — the initial motivation for the exercise replaced with something more substantial, until the excercise is no longer relevant.I initially started this off after realizing that I had inadvertantly been contributing daily to open source for a week or so. In the past, my\ncontributions to open source used to be in bursts, which meant that I would be out of touch at times. I decided to try and work on extending this.\nAfter around 30 days, I had a concrete habit. After around 40, I realized that I’d become much more efficient at working on random bugs (even in unfamiliar codebases),\nthus being able to spend more time writing real code.Initially I had set a bunch of rules (listed in my original post), which had stuff like issues/readme edits not counting (and no date manipulation!). I tweaked the rules around the 80-mark\nto include issues/readmes when I had written code that day but it was lost in a commit squash or rebase. I think much later I dropped the rules about issues and readme edits entirely;\njust considering “anything that shows up on the punchcard which is not a result of date manipulation” to be valid. At that point I was already quite involved in multiple projects\nand didn’t care so much about the streak or the original rules — it was just a habit at that point.Now, I’m a regular contributor to both the Servo and Rust projects. I also have a bunch of personal projects (some lints and syntax extensions for Rust, as well as a gc, along with a lot of older projects that I don’t actively work on but maintain) and am trying to regularly blog. I’ve\nalso gotten well into the habit of sending pull requests for fixing mistakes or annoyances. When all this comes together, I end up with at least one contribution a day. Sometimes more.\nI have tons of things queued that I want to work on (both personal and as a part of Servo/Rust/elsewhere), if only I had the time.If you do have enough spare time, I do recommend trying this. Once you get enough momentum the power of habit will keep it going, and if\nmy case is anything of an indicator2 you’ll eventually have a good chunk of contributions and some concrete open source involvement.Please note that GitHub streaks shouldn’t be used as a metric, ever. They’re great for self motivation. As a metric for tracking employee performance,\nor for filtering interview candidates; not so much. It’s way too rough a metric (like LoC written), and oversimplifies the work that goes into code.\nAs far as using it to boost interview candidates; not everyone has the time or inclination to contribute to open source after a day job in programming,\nand that’s okay. I’m a physics student — programming is like a hobby for me3 which I’ll gladly do daily. Now that I have a programming intern,\nI’m pretty sure there will be days where I don’t want to program further after leaving the office.",

    "text": [
      "Dungeon of the Endless is a roguelike, tower defense game developed by Amplitude Studios and released in October 2014 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X systems, August 2015 for iOS devices, and for Xbox One in March 2016. It is the third game of their loosely connected Endless series, which includes Endless Space and Endless Legend.\nIn the game, the player takes the role of the survivors of a prison spaceship, its escape pod having crashed to the surface of a strange planet. To escape, they must take an energy crystal through several floors, each floor filled with a number of dangerous creatures. To help, the player can have their survivors explore the randomly generated levels to collect resources as to enable power to various rooms and construct turrets to fend off the enemies when they move the crystal from its starting point to the elevator to the next floor.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDungeon of the Endless is a roguelike game, featuring procedurally generated levels and the notion of permadeath, so that each runthrough of the game is different. The game is based on directing the survivors of a prison spacecraft (crew, prisoners, and civilians alike), having crash-landed on a strange alien planet, through several levels as to achieve escape from the planet. At the start of each game, the player selects two characters with each character having different statistics such as health, attack, defense power, and movement speed, as well as a number of abilities. The player is able to control each character separately or in tandem by directing them to move to the various rooms on the current level or open doors on that level, as well as to initiate any special ability or to heal them. Otherwise, the characters will act autonomously such as fending off any enemies that enter the room to the best of their ability. On the first level of the game, the characters will start in the crashed escape pod with the power crystal, while on subsequent levels, they will start on the elevator that they took from the previous level.\nThe game plays out in primarily a turn-based manner, each turn marked when a new door on the level is opened. At the start of each turn, the player gains fixed amounts of three resources: Industry, Science, and Food. Industry is used primarily in the construction of turrets and resource generators; Science is used to research new types of turrets and generators, and Food is used to heal the characters, or increase their experience level which improves their statistics, and gives them new abilities. Certain rooms may have objects that can be scavenged for more of these resources. Furthermore, rooms will have Dust, which powers the crystal. As the crystal gains more power, the player can \"activate\" a limited number of continuous sets of rooms, allowing them to build resource generators and turrets on rooms which have been activated. Players can also deactivate a room at any time to reroute the power to a different room, disabling the turrets and generators in that room. Other rooms may feature item chests, shopkeepers, and research stations, or they may contain survivors that players can recruit to their party (up to 4 characters total).\nOpening a new door may also cause monsters to appear, appearing at random rooms across the map in any room that is not activated or lacking its own power source. The monsters will attack both the party and the crystal; killing the creatures has a chance of creating more Dust to run the crystal. The characters will lose health with attacks and will die if it drops to zero, though once all newly spawned monsters are defeated, their health is fully restored. If the crystal is attacked, it will permanently lose Dust, and if this drops to zero, the crystal is destroyed and the game is over. During monster attacks, the player can freely move the characters around between open rooms to obtain the best tactical placement, such as fighting monsters alongside numerous turrets. Once any spawned monsters are defeated, the player can move characters about and build defenses freely until they opt to open the next door.\nOnce the exit point on the level has been found, the player then must have one character collect the crystal and carry it slowly from the start to the exit point, while other characters protect the carrier from hordes of monsters that appear at this point. If the crystal carrier dies, the game is over, but if all surviving players make it to the room with the exit point, the player advances to the next level. The goal of the game is to complete 12 of these levels, each with more difficult monsters that appear, with at least one character carrying the crystal to the final exit point.\nA meta-game exists in that the player can unlock additional characters for starting the game by recruiting new characters they find on levels and either completing the game or three levels with that character alive. Additionally, by achieving certain goals, the player can unlock different gameplay modes, such as one where the characters will start off much stronger than the enemies but will not regain health once a monster wave is defeated, forcing them to rely on food, healing turrets or items to heal.\nThe game supports online play with up to four players.  Each player controls one character, and each gains separate resources on the opening of new doors. New characters can be recruited by one player if there is space in the party, which are then controlled by that player.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDungeon of the Endless was developed by Amplitude Studios alongside the development of their expected-flagship title Endless Legend; the team for Dungeon was kept small to about four to five people, and used a simple pixel-based art style to keep the project simple. Amplitude's co-founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis stated that while they were developing a deep, high-quality 4X-based game in Endless Legend, the concept of Dungeon came from \"some crazy drinking evening\", and instead of trying to approach the smaller title with crowdfunding, sought additional funding to support the title.Dungeon of the Endless was first released as an Early access title on the Steam software store on December 11, 2013, and the full version was released on October 27, 2014. An iOS version was also developed and released on August 20, 2015. The title was released for the Xbox One on March 16, 2016.A free Team Fortress 2 based expansion was added in June 2015 for personal computers, adding in characters and items based on Team Fortress 2. An expansion called \"Organic Matters\" was also released on November 24, 2015, which included new playable characters, monsters, additional modules that can be built, a new endgame sequence, and support for controllers, and a separate content pack called \"The Rescue Team\" featuring three new playable-characters.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nDungeon of the Endless has received generally positive reviews, comparing the title to other hybrid roguelike such as FTL: Faster Than Light. Some have criticized the game for having low replay value, in that once you have succeeded to complete a runthrough of the game, you will likely have experienced all the hazards that the game presents, and while one can repeat the game with different characters to start, the experience will be mostly the same.The title was named as an honorable mention in the Excellence in Design category for the 2015 Independent Games Festival awards. It was also nominated for Strategy/Simulation Game of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Game Design for the 18th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "By\nEmanuel Maiberg\n2014-10-28T22:00:00.3ZReviewDungeon of the Endless borrows from many games to create something new, and it's a fun challenge, even if there isn't much reason to beat it more than once.It's the eighth floor of Dungeon of the Endless, and with a full squad of four, well-equipped, level 6-7 characters, I have everything under control. I set up turrets next to the unpowered rooms where aliens could spawn whenever I open another door, securing a path between the crystal I need to protect and the elevator to the next floor. I send Sara Numas, a katana-wielding bounty hunter and the fastest character in the group, to open doors, then run back to the crystal room to fight off whatever I've unleashed with the rest of the group. By the time the aliens get past the defenses, they're weak, and we take them out easily.Then, of course, it all goes to hell. In my defense, I had no idea that if I spent enough time on a floor, the aliens will eventually bust through closed doors all by themselves and stream out in great numbers, but Dungeon of the Endless teaches all of its important lessons this way. It's a cruel, but entertaining learning experience.Its pause-at-any-time combat, desperate race to the finish, and strategies that forced me to cut off a limb to save the body reminded me of FTL, while its character upgrades, inventory, and squad management reminded of XCOM. And then there's the tower defense element, where each room has a set number of nodes where I could place turrets, healing units, and other useful gadgets.Dungeon of the Endless pulls from many popular games and genres from the last couple of years, but what's wonderful about it is that all these elements come together to create something entirely new.I start each run in an escape pod that crash lands on an alien planet. The only way out is up through 12 floors of an alien infested dungeon, and I have to bring the crystal with me to power my escape.Each stage has two phases. First I have to find the elevator to the next floor, opening one door at a time. Each time I open a door there's a chance I'll find aliens that will immediately attack my squad, defenses, or the crystal. If my entire squad or the crystal goes down, it’s game over. If I survive whatever happens after opening a door, I have infinite time to plan my next move.Dust, a resource that makes the crystal more powerful, lets me provide power to rooms, which ensures aliens don't spawn there, and activates the room's major and minor module slots. Major modules are mostly for gathering resources: Industry, which I need to build anything, Science for researching upgrades, and Food to heal and level up heroes. Minor modules house different kinds of turrets.I've seen all these turret types before in other tower defense games, but having a squad on the ground meaningfully recontextualizes that familiar gameplay. There are many different hero and module combinations to experiment with, and I'm much more invested in the characters I'm tower-defending because I customized them myself.For example, I gave Elise Ness, a freelance demolitionist in a giant space suit, a big machine gun that deals a lot of damage. With a healing module and another that boosts her attacks, she can protect a room by herself from most threats.I can heal heroes and activate up to two of their special abilities, but that's the full extent of direct combat controls. The trick is knowing what room to put the heroes in, and how to prepare those rooms in their favor. Once they're in there, they'll take care of the rest automatically.The only way to get Dust is by finding it in new rooms, but there's always less Dust than there are rooms, ensuring that a wave of aliens can spawn whenever I open a door. After finding the elevator, it's time for the second phase. I need to bring the crystal and the heroes to the elevator, but picking the crystal up will cause large waves of aliens to spawn in every unpowered room, and unlike waves in the first phase, they won't stop coming until we’re out of there, or dead. The most interesting choice at that point is what rooms to power up.My favorite method was to explore a floor until I had enough Dust to power a path between the crystal and next elevator, build as many turrets as I could along the way, and hope they slowed the aliens enough so I could get to the elevator before they caught up with me.It took me a couple of runs to realize that I couldn't just sprint through floors. Dungeon of the Endless' universe, which mixes space marines with walking skeletons and wooden chests, conveys a lot of dread with its dimly-lit but colorful, pixelated artstyle, and there are some really menacing aliens in the upper floors.Opening a door doesn't only give me a chance to find the loot I need to deal with them, but counts as a turn which collects resources from whatever major modules I've built. Do I make a run for the elevator now, when I know I have a fair shot of getting there, or do I take a chance and open another door? There's a lot of equipment, research, and upgrades to choose from in Dungeon of the Endless, but the game hinges on the decision to open a door, or not, and it was loaded with tension every single time for the eight hours I played it. There's no loading a previous save. It's a commitment.The other big question that kept me interested was if could make it to the top. It was challenging, and so far I've only been able to do it on the \"too easy\" mode, but once I did, I was pretty much done.Floor layouts are randomly generated, and I was always curious to discover all the little visual details in each new room. There are also new heroes to earn, and different escape pods, which tweak some of the basic rules and starting conditions of a run (like ships in FTL). Still, once I've survived one alien-infested, sci-fi/fantasy hybrid space dungeon, I've kind of survived them all. The aliens have a lot of nasty surprises, but they didn't force me to change up my strategy once I found one that works.It took me at least six tense hours to find that strategy, and for $13/£10, I can definitely recommend taking a ride on that elevator.What is it? A roguelike, tactical RPG, tower defense hybrid.

      "ReadersGambitPosted by Esler on Wednesday, March 9, 2016 · Leave a CommentRoguelikes have always been a staple on PC for indie developers, everyone seems to have their take on the genre. As somebody who doesn’t own a PC, or at least a PC modern enough to run more than MS paint and a web browser, it has been both a blessing and a curse when waiting and hoping for some interesting – almost niche – titles to trickle down to home consoles. Thankfully Dungeon of the Endless was not lost in the sea of similar roguelikes and will be arriving on the Xbox One shortly.\n\nDungeon of the Endless blends that staple mechanics of a roguelike RPG and blends them effortlessly with tower defense, cooperative play, and interesting characters to provide and experience unlike any I have been able to enjoy before. French Developer Amplitude Studios have went above and beyond when it comes to blending the two, creating character archetypes and objects that allow players to approach defensively or split from the pack of survivors and become a lone wolf.Although the story of Dungeon of the Endless is not formally relayed through cutscenes or dialogue there is a great deal of information nestled in the characters and the picture album, which only unlocks certain information when criteria is met. Which is a true shame, as a little more story or information could carry Dungeon of the Endless a bit further, especially when it comes to character interaction and understanding. For the most part the only aspects of the story you really need to know are that you were previously aboard a prison ship, and that you have now crash landed on a planet inhabited by an ancient race known as the “Endless”. As Dungeon of the Endless is technically an installment in the “Endless” series it would have been nice to either play previous installments or have a brief introduction explaining the nature of what may have happened previously. Although as I am unfamiliar with the series there may be little to no tangible connections between the games, bar some similar settings and lore.In spite of Dungeon of the Endless lacking in story, there is a great deal of character and information nestled in both the environments and playable characters, some of which are not playable at first. When you initially crash land deep below the planet’s surface the areas are loaded with technology and small creatures ready to attack on sight, suggesting that these levels have remained largely unattended, but the further up you climb the more human enemies look and the more complex the dungeons aesthetic becomes as you draw closer to the “Endless”. It’s what Amplitude have managed to achieve with a very limited style, making subtle changes at every turn, that keeps players interested and invested. At times these environments would feel like they draw inspiration from the greats of sci-fi cinema, like Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, but put their own spin on it.Just like the environments of Dungeon of the Endless there is a vast and varied cast with all manners of stats, attributes, and equipment that means you will want to try every single character to find a best fit for your chosen run. Some characters will have higher hitpoints, and strength, but lack the ability to get certain perks because of a low with stat. Others will be boosted by grouping together, giving players stat boosts when in the same room, and even providing a heal when their skill replenishes. All this variety leads to numerous characters being able to boost resource generation, being more suitable for exploration, or just aiding the team by repairing damaged turrets, or by defending the crystal in the first tile. With changing scenarios and different team compositions/approaches, there are countless ways of building a team to see you through to the end of the various modes available. Personally I loved going Warden Mormish, as I was able to use his abilities to generate dust efficiently while operating modules for extra resources because of his perks. And coupling him with a strong independent character meant that he was able to sit back and generate resources without much stress.All of these wonderful designs are pulled together in Dungeon of the Endless’s various “Pods”. Prior to starting a mission you are given the option to select one pod, a basic pod with no attributes or modifiers, and you proceed to escape the prison ship as it crashes to the planet. Once the game officially starts you are tasked with finding the escape point to the floor by exploring a succession of procedurally generated rooms. Each room potentially poses a threat of having monsters inhabiting it, or proves as a paradise with its own power source allowing you to build turrets and resource modules. As you progress there are various instances, some of which good and others bad, that can power down rooms, provide new equipment through chests or merchants, or provide much needed resources in the form of stock piles – there are even some gambling type instances in which you can wager your current resources for a chance at the contents of a “Dust Factory” or “Cryotube”. By clearing rooms, or through successful instances, you will generate much needed resources. These various resources can be used to power rooms, level up characters, heal, build items, purchase equipment from merchants, and research upgrades.Both resource management and turret placement play an integral part of Dungeon of the Endless and learning what turrets best suit the area you are in and how to place items is key. Saving your “dust” – the resource used to light a room – to section off entire areas means that no enemies are able to spawn, preventing the need to build defensive turrets around resource modules, saving you valuable resources, but also presents a massive risk as you never have enough dust to light every room on the floor without very specific characters in the perfect scenario. This ebb and flow between risk and reward applies to almost every aspect of Dungeon of the Endless, and when you manage to secure an entire floor while netting a large number of resources you are overcome by an immense feeling of satisfaction. In fact the first time I finally completed a dungeon I took a few moments to bask in the brilliant illustrated end game screen and savoured the moment before diving right back in.And you needn’t dive in alone. Dungeon of the Endless supports up to 4 players at once, although in changing to multiplayer you lose the ability to select a pod. So all these challenges can be tackled with your friends, adding a new layer to how you manage resources and who gets to do what. Sometimes it might just result in a shouting match between the group as somebody opened a door before everyone is ready and now the crystal is in bits and you have lost all the power to the rooms because of a player’s enthusiasm for opening doors.It’s this persistent and enthralling experience that keeps Dungeon of the Endless going, the ability to conquer difficult levels and persevere through increasingly resistant enemy forces will have you chomping at the bit before. Over time you will unlock some more complex pods with different modifiers and the learning process starts all over again. No matter what difficulty you are on, the enchanting soundtrack lures you in as you strap yourself in to the escape pods for another round. I have never quite found as much joy in a roguelike as I have with Dungeon of the Endless and for fans of both tower defence games and roguelikes I couldn’t recommend it enough.Category: Games, Reviews · Tags: Amplitude Studios, Blackrock Mountain, Dungeon of the Endless, iOS, PC, X1, Xbox OneComments are closed.Copyright © 2018 · All Rights Reserved · ReadersGambitMagazine Theme v4 by Organic Themes · WordPress Hosting · RSS Feed · Log in",

    "title": "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth",
    "text": [
      "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is an independent roguelike video game designed by Edmund McMillen, and is developed and published by Nicalis. Rebirth is a remake of The Binding of Isaac developed by McMillen and Florian Himsl and first released in 2011 as an Adobe Flash application. The Flash platform had limitations that led McMillen to work with Nicalis to produce Rebirth using a more advanced game engine to surpass these limitations and allowing McMillen to include additional content and gameplay features. Rebirth was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita in November 2014, and for Xbox One, New Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U in July 2015. After having Apple reject the Rebirth game due to its content, Nicalis has gotten Apple's pre-approval to release an iOS version, which was released on January 11, 2017. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released on March 17, 2017.\nAs with the original game, Rebirth's story is based on the Biblical tale of the Binding of Isaac and is inspired by McMillen's own childhood growing up in a religious family. The player controls a young boy named Isaac whose mother, convinced she is doing the work of God, strips him of all his clothes and possessions and locks him in his room. With his mother about to sacrifice him, Isaac escapes to the basement and fights through randomized dungeons created in a roguelike fashion. The player defeats monsters using Isaac's tears as projectiles and collects items that improve Isaac's attributes and abilities. Eventually, the player must face Isaac's mother. Two expansions have been released, Afterbirth and Afterbirth+, in October 2015 and January 2017, respectively, each introducing more game content and gameplay modes, with Afterbirth+ further adding support for user-created content.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nSimilar to the original, Rebirth is a top-down 2D roguelike game where the player controls the character Isaac (or 10 unlockable characters) as he adventures throughout his mother's basement, fighting off monsters and collecting power-ups. Ultimately, the player aims to first defeat Isaac's mother while she tries to crush him underfoot, then moves inside her, where the player must defeat Isaac's mom's heart. Rebirth is considered a roguelike-like game; the dungeon levels are procedurally generated into a number of rooms including at least one boss battle, and the game has permadeath: once the chosen character dies from taking too much damage, the game is over and the player will have to restart. Rebirth allows the player to save the state of the game, allowing them to quit the game during a run, and come back later to finish that run, though this save state is deleted upon restarting the game.The game is controlled similarly to a twin-stick shooter: the player moves their character around the screen while they are able to shoot the tears that they cry in another direction. These tears act as bullets to defeat enemies that try to harm the player-character. The player-character's health is tracked by a number of hearts: the character can find items that can replenish hearts while others grant the character additional hearts, extending their health. Throughout the dungeons the player-character will find bombs, which can be used to both damage foes and blow up obstacles, keys to open certain doors and treasure chests, coins to buy items at various stores, and a large number of items that impact the character's attributes, such as speed and the damage and range of their tears, and other gameplay effects, such as gaining a character that floats behind the player-character and aids in combat. Some of these items are passive, others are active and reusable, requiring the player to wait a number of rooms before they can reuse it, while others are single use items that disappear after use. The player can typically collect any number of passive items, their effects stacking on previous ones, potentially creating powerful combinations for the player. Otherwise, the player can only carry one reusable item and one single-use item, replacing it for another if they pick such up. Among other rooms within the dungeons include special challenge rooms and mini-boss fights.In addition to expanding greatly on the number of items, monsters, and room types (including those that span multiple screens) from the original game, Rebirth provides integrated support for controller support. Rebirth allows for a second local player to join in on a drop in/drop out mechanic. While active, the second player controls a follower of the first player-character that has all of the same attributes and abilities of that character, though will cost the first player-character one heart to use which is given to the follower character. This second character, however, cannot plant bombs or carry items. Rebirth also provides a feature that allows players to enter the random seed for a run, which will regenerate the same dungeon with the same items and monster population when used. The player is presented with this seed after completing a run, or when the game is paused, which they can reuse again or share with others.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nThe plot in Rebirth remains the same as the original game, following along the biblical tale of the same name. The young boy Isaac had been living happily with his mom. One day, spurred on by watching too many religious programs on the television, his mom believed she received instruction that Isaac had become corrupted and she must try to save him. First, she removed all his possessions, including his toys and clothes, believing these were corrupting him. Later, she locked him in his room to never be let out so as to protect him from the evils that existed outside. After hearing the further instruction that to show her devotion to her faith she must sacrifice her son, Isaac flees from his approaching mother through a trap door into the basement, leading to the events within the game.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nThe Binding of Isaac was originally developed by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl in 2011 from an internal game jam following the completion of McMillen's previous game, Super Meat Boy. With Super Meat Boy being successful, McMillen had not concerned himself with making a popular game, and instead wanted to craft a game that melded the top-down dungeon approach of The Legend of Zelda with the roguelike genre, wrapping that in a religious allegory based on his own childhood experiences. They used Adobe Flash as it enabled them to develop the game quickly. McMillen quietly released the game to Steam for personal computers, where it proved to be very popular. Looking to expand the game, McMillen and Himsl discovered limitations on Flash that made expansion difficult. Though they were able to incorporate more content through the Wrath of the Lamb expansion, McMillen had to forego a second planned expansion due to the Flash limitations.After the release of the original game, McMillen was approached by Tyrone Rodriguez of Nicalis, a development and publishing studio that had helped to bring personal computer games Cave Story and VVVVVV to consoles. Rodriguez offered Nicalis' services to help port The Binding of Isaac to consoles. McMillen was interested but required that they needed to recreate the game outside of Flash to incorporate the additional material he had to forego previously, and to fix some additional bugs found since release. McMillen also asked to be left out of the business side of the game's release following his negative experiences in dealing with business matters with Super Meat Boy, which Rodriguez agreed to. Rebirth was announced in November 2012 as a console version of The Binding of Isaac, with plans to improve the graphics to 16-bit colors and incorporate the content planned for the second expansion as well as new material. Local cooperative play was also to be added to the game, though McMillen stated they could not add online co-operative play as that would drastically lengthen the development time.McMillen wanted to overhaul the entire game, particularly its graphics as he felt they were an \"eyesore\". After polling players to determine which art style to use for the remake, McMillen and Nicalis brought in artists to improve the original assets for the new style and began working on the new content. McMillen also commissioned a new soundtrack for the remake from Matthias Bossi and Jon Evans.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nInitially, McMillen and Rodriguez felt that they would develop Rebirth for the Nintendo 3DS, as a tribute to its roots in Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series. In 2012, Nintendo refused to allow the game to be released for the 3DS, as, at the time, the original The Binding of Isaac had received game classifications placing it as a mature game with potentially objectionable content, and Nintendo did not publish such titles for its systems. Though they had spent some time on creating the 3DS version before the refusal, McMillen and Rodriguez decided to focus on personal computer and releases for the PlayStation platforms instead. These platforms gave them more capabilities to work with, allowing them to increase the capabilities of the game. In addition to the PlayStation 3 and Vita consoles, Nicalis was in discussions with Microsoft for a release on the Xbox systems; McMillen had also considered a possible iOS release in the future. McMillen and Nicalis opted to move development from the PlayStation 3 to the newly announced PlayStation 4 in August 2013, announcing its release at Sony's Gamescom presentation. The PlayStation 4 and Vita versions were released alongside the versions for personal computers on November 4, 2014.During development, three senior employees within Nintendo—Steve Singer, the vice president of licensing; Mark Griffin, a senior manager in licensing, and Dan Adelman, the head of indie development—all championed the game within Nintendo. The three continued to work within Nintendo, and in 2014, were able to secure approval to allow Rebirth to be released for the 3DS and the Wii U. McMillen and Nicalis, having spent time on the game tailored to run on more powerful systems, worked to try to keep the game intact while porting it to the 3DS. They spent about a year on this conversion, and while they had got the game to work on the original 3DS model, the performance was sub-optimal for the game. With help from Nintendo, they were one of the first developers to secure a development kit for the New Nintendo 3DS, which had more powerful hardware and memory to support running the game at the desired speed to match the other platform releases. The announcement of the New 3DS and Wii U versions was made alongside plans for an Xbox One version. The release of the game for all three systems was on July 23, 2015.In January 2016, Nicalis had reported they were working on an iOS port of the game, but in the following month, the company reported that Apple had rejected the application from their app store citing that the game depicts \"violence towards children\" and is against their content policies. Nicalis has worked with Apple to gain pre-approval and will release a universal iOS version of Rebirth including the Afterbirth+ expansion with additional improvements for that platform, including the use of iCloud for ease-of-play across multiple devices. While they are looking to add this onto the Vita's port, Nicalis stated it was a very low priority for them due to the limited processing ability of the device to handle many weapon combos. The initial version iOS version of the core game, without expansions, was released on January 11, 2017.After teasing of a potential release on the upcoming Nintendo Switch console, Nicalis confirmed in January 2017 that Rebirth with both expansions will be released for the Switch in March 2017 as both a retail and digital title for the system; though initially set to be released on March 3 on a launch title, last minute adjustments required Nicalis to delay the titles until March 17. Because of their existing relationship with Nintendo for both Wii U and New Nintendo 3DS versions, Rodriguez said that they were able to get developer prototype hardware for the Switch to port the game to that system. Rodriguez said they were able to get Rebirth working on the Switch easily, due to both their own approach for developing Rebirth with appropriate hooks that would be integrated into the respective system features such as Achievements as to make porting easy, and the ease of the Switch's development platform. The game was ultimately released for Switch on March 17, 2017. This version allows up to four players in a drop-in/drop-out co-operative mode, with the other three players using Joy-Con to control one of Isaac's \"buddies\" as with the 2-player co-op mode for personal computers. The physical version of the Switch game includes a manual fashioned similar to the manual that shipped with the original The Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo Entertainment System.\n\n\n=== Afterbirth expansion ===\nIn February 2015, McMillen announced the first expansion for Rebirth, titled Afterbirth. Afterbirth added items, enemies, alternate floors and bosses, and endings. In Afterbirth, Greed Mode is added, which is a different game mode than the main game, said to be much harder. It was released on October 30, 2015 for Windows, OS X, and Linux computers. The expansion was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions on May 10, 2016. The expansion is unlikely to be released on any other platforms due to limitations of these platforms' hardware capabilities and the more complex mechanics required by Afterbirth.In programming the original The Binding of Isaac, McMillen had placed a number of hidden secrets within the game, which fans had started to discover and discuss on a Reddit subforum. With the dedication to finding these secrets by fans, McMillen took added steps to further hide these within patches and updates. With Rebirth, McMillen knew players would be seeking out any hidden secrets, and had taken steps to make the existence of a new playable character, the Lost, completely hidden. Unlocking it required a number of highly specific steps including having the player-character die over and over in specific circumstances, and hints for what needed to be done were scattered about the game's assets. As such, McMillen and his team anticipated it would take a long time before players would discover the Lost. However, on release of Rebirth, players on the Reddit subforum took to the game's executable files to search for clues about secrets within the game, discovering the existence of the Lost and the means to unlock it within about 109 hours of the game's release. At the time, McMillen said he was disappointed with the community, feeling that his team took effort to hide these types of secrets to be found by the community through gameplay and clues within the game itself and not by looking to the program's executable; while he was still planning to release Afterbirth, McMillen said that he was not going to hurry its release knowing that players would do a similar investigation on its release.With the Afterbirth expansion, McMillen wanted again to hide another character, this being the Keeper, as well as elements related to Isaac's father which the game already hints at, but knew that players would data-mine the program files to find it. Instead, he planned an alternate reality game (ARG) that would require players to work in the real world as well to discover clues. At the same time, McMillen was expecting the birth of his daughter at the end of September 2015, but with the expansion planned for an October release, so he had to arrange the ARG to continue in lieu of his presence. When Afterbirth was released, players found what they thought were bugs in the game, such as lacking a number of new items that had been promised by the game's store page, and some players accused McMillen of deceiving them. Though some of these omissions were planned as part of the ARG, McMillen discovered that the released game had accidentally lacked some of these new items using a different build than as planned, and his team raced to patch the game, as well as trying to provide support and hints about the Keeper's existence using the number 109 which had become a part of the mythos in the players' culture. McMillen later commented that he found that the missing items that should have been in the released game had distracted players from the secrets he had purposely hidden.With the release of this patch, players began to discover in-game hints towards the Keeper, engaging in McMillen's ARG as planned. Some of the clues included calling a special phone number, and identifying real world locations around the Santa Cruz area, where McMillen is located, that were tied to the game. Following additional clues, including locating a buried figure of one of the game's mini-bosses, the community was able to unlock the Keeper in the game and additional in-game items to collect. Though McMillen thought in the end the ARG worked out, he believes he would not engage the community in a similar manner to avoid making himself look like an ego-driven person.\n\n\n=== Afterbirth+ expansion ===\nIn December 2015, Nicalis announced that a second expansion was in development, titled Afterbirth+. In addition to adding monsters, bosses, items, and a playable character to the game, the expansion includes a bestiary that tracks how many of each type of creature and boss the player has cumulatively defeated, and modding support to allow players to craft room types, import their own graphics, and script out events using the Lua language. The expansion was released for Windows platforms on January 3, 2017 and during Q2 2017 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as downloadable content. The Switch version of the game was released in North America on March 17, 2017 and was released in Europe and Australasia on September 7, 2017. This version includes both Afterbirth and Afterbirth+ at release, and limited-time launch editions of the game are available both physically and digitally, making it the first Nicalis-published game to be released physically.\nSome of the best mods developed by the community have been added to the game through \"Booster packs\" (initially planned to be monthly, but later spread out due to constraints), with the first releasing in March 2017, and the fifth and final one being released on May 1st, 2018. Some content within the last two packs include material that was developed by the players that created the Antibirth fan expansion, which McMillen reached out to help support these booster packs.\n\n\n=== Future development ===\nWhile McMillen had wanted to support the modding community and expansions as part of Rebirth's design, he found that several of the ideas started overlapping with his own thoughts of what a sequel would be for The Binding of Isaac. He also found that any further expansions to the game would essentially require him to rework the base game engine from the ground up. As such, with the last Booster packs that contained Antibirth content, he considers that The Binding of Isaac is complete. McMillen plans to focus on smaller games, and still wants to develop within The Binding of Isaac setting; he is planning to release The Legend of Bum-bo, a prequel to The Binding of Isaac later in 2018, which employs different mechanics.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Binding of Isaac: Rebirth received \"generally favourable\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic, with scores of 86/100 based on 10 critic reviews for personal computers, 88/100 based on 15 critics for the PlayStation 4, 78/100 based on 4 critics for the Nintendo 3DS version, and 85/100 based on 8 critics for the Nintendo Switch. The iOS version received \"universal acclaim\" with a 93/100 based on 4 reviews.Dan Stapleton of IGN praised Rebirth for the seemingly endless variation in gameplay that each run-through creates, giving him \"plenty of motivation\" to continue to play the game, and only criticized the title for its lack of in-game information on the various power-ups one can collect. GameSpot's Brent Todd felt that while the game may initially be disturbing to players with its story and imagery, Rebirth has \"speedy, varied gameplay and seemingly neverending new features\" that would keep the player entertained for a long time. Simon Parkin for Eurogamer said that Rebirth, at times, \"feels like the product of the psychotherapeutic process\", but is \"the most accessible Rogue-like yet made\" due to its easy control scheme and randomization through each run. Nic Rowen for Destructoid said that Rebirth was a vast improvement on the original Binding of Isaac, and that it is \"an incredible experience that can't be missed\".Afterbirth+ received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. Jose Otero for IGN praised the variety of content added by Afterbirth+, stating that \"the unpredictable items and varied enemies make it one of the most wacky and replayable games I’ve ever experienced.\" Peter Glagowksi at Destructoid gave the DLC a positive review and deemed it an \"impressive effort\", but mused that the DLC's base content has little to offer for newcomers to the series.Rock, Paper, Shotgun was critical of the DLC's difficulty, which they believed to be largely derived from random, untelegraphed enemy behavior. Speaking on the design cohesion of Afterbirth+, reviewer Adam Smith characterized the DLC as \"mashing together existing parts of the game and producing either a weak cover version or a clumsy remix\". Review outlet Beastby likewise critiqued the fairness of Afterbirth+, explaining in their review: \"The question isn’t always 'Will I enjoy the gameplay loop?' but rather 'How many unfair runs will it take for me to have one in which I stand a chance?'\" The modding API of Afterbirth+ was described as \"a disappointment\" by members of the Team Alpha modding group, who expressed frustration at both the API's \"massive shortcomings\" and Nicalis' lack of support.As of  July 2015, both The Binding of Isaac and Rebirth have seen combined sales of over 5 million copies; this includes the sales of the original game which had reached 3 million copies sold by July 2014.\n\n\n== The Binding of Isaac: Antibirth ==\nPrior to release of the mod tools with Afterbirth+, a fan-made mod of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth called The Binding of Isaac: Antibirth was released in December 2016. Similar to the official expansions, Antibirth adds a number of playable-characters, bosses, power-ups, and other content, crafted by players in the game's community, while adjusting some of the gameplay aspects that had been changed in the Afterbirth expansion to work more closely with how Rebirth had been originally released. Alice O'Connor of Rock Paper Shotgun considered the mod as a \"more difficult than [The Binding of Isaac]\" and a new challenge to work alongside with the official game expansions. At the request of McMillen, the group reworked some of the Antibirth content that was incorporated within the booster packs for the Afterbirth+ expansion.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

      "Morph into different supernatural forms to battle mystical beasts in this daunting action gameThe Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is the remake of the original dungeon-crawler, and as a popular adventure game with procedurally-generated levels and an engaging level of difficulty, there are few games with the same playability.It should be noted immediately that this game is geared toward an adult audience since the content of the game is rather mature. The player controls Isaac, a son who has been locked in the basement by his mother. Isaac's mother was instructed by God to sacrifice Isaac as a sign of her faith, much like the biblical tale. That alone should tell most players that they shouldn't share the game with their children or younger siblings.This version is basically a reimagining of the original, which lacked certain elements that the producers wanted to include but were unable to due to the limits of their first system. The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is basically how the producers wanted the game to be in the first place.The random nature of the game is what makes it so repeatably playable. Each level is generated as the player progresses through the game, and while many of the elements within the levels might stay the same, their timing and locations are different every single time. Trial and error is the best way to make it through this dungeon crawler since death is something that is nearly unavoidable. Players who succumb to the monsters in the basement must start completely over at the beginning.In this version, there are 10 playable characters, 50 final bosses, 20 challenge levels, and more than 100 average enemies. Nearly every single enemy has been redesigned from the original, which gives the game even more of an updated feel.Improved team-based gameplay with new characters, bigger maps, custom skins, better weapons and user modificationsCrime pays more with every challenging heist scenario plus new customizable weapons and character masksThe action-packed fifth main installment in a world-renowned series, complete with single player and multiplayer modesTaking its inspiration from some of the legendary games like DayZ, Rust is a tough game on all accountsno thanks",

      "The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (commonly referred to as Rebirth for short) is the remake of the original Flash game The Binding of Isaac. It was developed by Nicalis with Edmund McMillen in a supervising position. It was originally released on November 4, 2014 on Steam for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux, as well as the PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. It was later released on the Xbox One, 3DS, and Wii U on July 23, 2015. 2 years later, its was released on the Nintendo Switch on March 3, 2017 along with already containing the 2 DLC that were made before.Rebirth features a new, non-Flash-based engine with 16-bit graphics, a new music score, and a redesigned interface intended to streamline gameplay. The game includes all of the content from the original game, as well as the additional content introduced in the Wrath of the Lamb expansion, while adding content that was cut from the original game due to the limitations of Flash.Rebirth was first conceptualized during the release of The Binding of Isaac: Wrath of the Lamb. Edmund McMillen admitted in a 2014 Q&A that there were plans to release another expansion of the game with a similar amount of content. Due to the limitations of Flash, corrupted files, and a general inability to continue support for the game, McMillen was at an impasse. When McMillen was approached by Tyrone Rodriguez of Nicalis about the possibility of a Super Meat Boy remake, McMillen instead suggested a Binding of Isaac remake as a workaround to the wall they had reached in development of the original. Despite bringing in a new developer to help with Rebirth, McMillen stayed in charge of nearly all aspects of the games development as the lead designer.From the beginning, McMillen wanted to implement a completely revamped art style. The original Flash art was completed in two months and McMillen was never quite happy with it. It was voted on by the community and eventually a 16-bit Game Boy Advance art style was chosen. McMillen requested that Rodriguez hand-pick a pixel artist as to not force himself to push other projects back to try and do the art on his own.Also planned from conception were: local 2-player co-op, 150+ new items, level seeds, new endings, and at least three new characters. Something that was deemed impossible at the time of development was support on Nintendo devices (though this was later changed).[2]The Binding of Issac: Rebirth brings back many aspects of the original. At it's core, it is still a top-down, 2D platforming dungeon crawler in which the player controls one of 14 characters and explores the levels of Isaac's basement. The player collects items, trinkets, tarot cards, and pills while attempting to survive a randomly generated dungeon floor composed of hazards such as fire, trapped chests, and challenge rooms. The player must advance through the basement while navigating through a multitude of enemies and bosses of varying rarity and strength.The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth highly favorable reviews from various sources. Multiple reviews gave the remake a higher rating than the original, citing the improvements in gameplay and the introduction of various items, enemies, bosses.Download (Steam)Danny BaranowskyPS4 PS Vita Wii U New 3DSXbox One“\"The creepy-cute dungeons of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth are amazingly different and challenging every time.\"”–Dan Stapleton, IGN, November 25, 2015[5]Metacritic86/100[6]88/100[7]N/A[8]80/100[9]85/100[10]77/100[11]IGN9.0/10[12]Gamespot8/10[13]Destructoid10/10[14]Dark Station4.5/5[15]The \"close to the original but pixelated\" lookThe black outlines lookThe SNES lookThe GBA lookAnother GBA mock-upWhat do you think of THIS!More updates as they unfold!It Moves!

      "Click on below button to start The Binding of Isaac Rebirth Download Free PC Game. It is a Full Version PC Game. Just download torrent and start playing it.The Binding of Isaac Rebirth Download Free Full Game is an independent roguelike video game and a remake of The Binding of Isaac, designed by Edmund McMillen, and developed and published by Nicalis. It was co-developed by McMillen and Florian Himsl and originally released in 2012 as an Adobe Flash application; Rebirth was developed with a more advanced game engine that enabled them surpass limitations of Flash, adding in more content McMillen had wanted in the original game and new gameplay features. Rebirth was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita in November 2014, and for Xbox One, New Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U in July 2015.As with the original game, Rebirth's story is based on the Biblical tale of the Binding of Isaac, and is inspired by McMillen's own childhood growing up in a religious family. The player controls a young boy named Isaac whose mother, convinced she is doing the work of God, strips him of all his clothes and possessions and locks him in his room. With his mother about to sacrifice him, Isaac escapes to the basement and fights through randomized dungeons created in a roguelike fashion. The player defeats monsters using Isaac's tears as bullets, and collects items that improve Isaac's attributes and abilities. Eventually the player must face Isaac's mother, and later even more demonic creatures. One expansion to Rebirth, expanding the number of items and playable characters, was released in 2015, and a second expansion that will include support for user-created content is due in 2016. The Binding of Isaac Rebirth Free Download.GameplaySimilar to the original, Rebirth is a top-down 2D dungeon crawler game where the player controls the character Isaac (or 10 unlockable characters) as he adventures throughout his mother's basement, fighting off monsters and collecting power-ups. Ultimately, the player aims to first defeat Isaac's mother while she tries to crush him underfoot, then moves to inside her, upon while the player must defeat Isaac's mom's own heart. Rebirth is considered a roguelike-like game; the dungeon levels are procedurally generated into a number of rooms including at least one boss battle, and the game has permadeath: once the chosen character dies from taking too much damage, the game is over and the player will have to restart. Rebirth allows the player to save the state of the game, allowing them to quit the game during a run, and then come back later to finish that run, though this save state is deleted upon restarting the game.The player moves their chosen character around each screen while they are able to shoot the tears that they cry in another direction. These tears act as bullets to defeat enemies that try to harm the player-character. The player-character's health is tracked by a number of hearts: the character can find items that can replenish hearts while others grant the character additional hearts, extending their health. The Binding of Isaac Rebirth Free Download PC Game. Throughout the dungeons the player-character will find bombs, which can be used to both damage foes and blow up obstacles, keys to open certain doors and treasure chests, coins to buy items at various stores, and a large number of items that impact the character's attributes, such as speed and the damage and range of their tears, and other gameplay effects, such as gaining a character that floats behind the player-character and aids in combat. Some of these items are passive, others are active and reusable, requiring the player to wait a number of rooms before they can reuse it, while others are single use items that disappear after use. The player can typically collect any number of passive items, their effects stacking on previous ones, potentially creating powerful combinations for the player. Otherwise, the player can only carry one reusable item and one single-use item, replacing it for another if they pick such up. Among other rooms within the dungeons include special challenge rooms and mini-boss fights.In addition to expanding greatly on the number of items, monsters, and room types (including those that span multiple screens) from the original game, Rebirth allows for a second local player to join in on a drop in/drop out mechanic. While active, the second player controls a follower of the first player-character that has all of the same attributes and abilities of that character, though will cost the first player-character one heart to use which is given to the follower character.PlotThe plot in Rebirth remains the same as the original game, following along the biblical tale of the same name. The young boy Isaac had been living happily with his mom. One day, spurred on by watching too many religious programs on the television, his mom believed she received instruction that Isaac had become corrupted and she must try to save him. First, she removed all his possessions, including his toys and clothes, believing these were corrupting him. Later, she locked him in his room and never be let out as to protect him from the evil that existed outside. When she hears further instruction that to show her devotion to her faith that she must kill Isaac, Isaac finds a means to escape his room into the basement, from which he then tries to escape, leading to the events within the game.

      "Official websiteGame mode: single / multiplayerMultiplayer mode: common screen, players: 1-2developer: Nicalispublisher : Nicalisgame release date:04Nov201411Jan2017The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth for PC, iOS and etc. is an expanded and modified version of a popular independent title, whose gameplay had been inspired by the first installment of The Legend of Zelda series, and similar titles. The original version of The Binding of Isaac has been created in Flash, and was released on PC in September 2011. The game was developed by only two people  Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl. McMillen had been known on the scene thanks to Super Meat Boy  a platform game from 2010 that has quickly gained loyal following from the genre fans. The creators tasked another developer with creating Rebirth  Nicalis studio, which specializes in similar projects. The developers introduced a new engine, avoiding certain limitations of Flash, and introduced a number of novelties and fixes.The plot is based on a biblical story of Abraham and his test of faith given to him by God, when he ordered him to make a sacrifice of his son, Isaac. In The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, the players assume the role of the boy, hiding from the danger in the houses cellar, which happens to be a nightmarish labyrinth full of demons and monsters from the most dreadful dreams.The basic idea of the gameplay hasnt changed in relation to the original version of The Binding of Isaac. The players traverse a randomly-generated labyrinth of chambers, culminating in a boss fight. During the exploration, we find various items that have an effect on heros statistics. The individual levels may contain shops, treasure rooms, and other secret locations, which require multiple playthroughs to be discovered. The items used to interact with the environment play a huge role in The Binding of Isaac. We use bombs to destroy obstacles or enemies, while keys are used to open numerous chests and doors to locked chambers. As the game progresses, we unlock additional characters, with differing strengths and bonuses available at the start of a new game.The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth for PC, iOS and etc. includes content that could be found in two DLC add-ons for The Binding of Isaac, as well as completely new additions, not available in the original game due to technological restrictions. Another novelty is a local cooperation mode, allowing for a joint tour of the labyrinth along with a friend.The visuals have been changed in order to resemble classic titles from 16-bit consoles. The design of items, characters, or enemies has not undergone major changes, but thanks to pixel-like look, they acquired some fresh appeal.age requirements: everyonePC / WindowsRecommended: Core i3 2.4 GHz, 8 GB RAM, graphic card 1 GB (GeForce GT 240 or better), 449 MB HDD, Windows XP/Vista(SP2)/7(SP1)/8Apple iOS",

      "Road Not Taken is an independent video game developed by Spry Fox for PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows and Mac. In a take on the Robert Frost poem of the same name, the game is described as being about life's surprises, both positive and negative.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nRoad Not Taken combines roguelike and puzzle game elements with the hopes of exploring unexpected surprises in accordance to the game's theme. As players explore, they will come across wild animals, impassable barriers, lost children and other objects. An object's use is not explained upfront, players are encouraged to learn about each object's use as they discover them, in traditional roguelike fashion.\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn development since at least 2013, the game was officially announced for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita in August 2013. Developer David Edery cited recent games FTL: Faster Than Light and Don't Starve as inspirations for the game. Writing at the PlayStation.Blog, Edery explained the formulas the team used for creating the gameplay: randomness and hand crafted puzzles were used in conjunction.Spry Fox organized a competition asking fans to submit audio of what they think a \"spry fox\" would say, the winner would be used for an in-game spry fox character. Spry Fox showed the game at PAX East in 2014 before launching on August 5th.Despite the game's original announcement containing a release on PS Vita, that version of the game has not been released.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nRoad Not Taken received mixed reviews from critics, with a score on review aggregator Metacritic of 70/100. Critics generally praised the art and themes, but were divided on the design choices. Writing for PlayStation LifeStyle, Dyani Wood felt the game \"proved to be a very unique game for its genre\" and concluded it's \"a great game to have in your PS4 library.\"In a mixed review for Game Informer, Matt Miller enjoyed seeing randomized puzzles with each playthrough, but felt the \"sense of repetition on similar (even if not identical) puzzles isn’t worth the trade-off.\" Others praised the random generation, but felt the game was too short.Some reviewers felt the game was an \"acquired taste\" and \"not for every gamer.\" Some pointed to the randomized gameplay management as a reason for this. Spry Fox responded to feedback on the game's difficulty, releasing a patch in December 2014 adding various fixes and gameplay additions.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nSpry Fox website",

      "Road Not Taken is an original puzzle game about life and loss that is currently being developed by Spry Fox!  Adventure through a vast, ever-changing forest in the aftermath of a brutal winter storm. Will you find your way?Progress is coming along nicely and we are aiming to release Road Not Taken before the end of the year. But we’re getting excited now and wanted to share a few tidbits of what’s to come!  🙂  Apologies for being a bit of a tease.This game grew out of a variety of influences.   We borrowed the name and theme from Robert Frost’s 1916 poem “The Road Not Taken“.  The mechanics are reminiscent of an evergreen roguelike and should provide hundreds of hours of original gameplay.  The art, created by the amazingly talented Brent “Meowza” Kobayashi (previously the Art Director for the Glitch MMO) blends the puzzle rooms of Zelda with his own very personal storybook illustrations.For Daniel, the designer on the project, (and previously designer of Triple Town, Panda Poet, Leap Day and co-designer of Steambirds and Realm of the Mad God) this is one of the more personal games he has created. When you grow up, you are often told that there is a singular path through life; you go to school, you get a job, you fall in love and then you start a family. What happens when someone wanders far off that path? There’s no single answer to that question, but this game is an exploration of at least one answer. It’s also an experiment with a more pointillist approach to narrative, which we think is particularly well-served by the roguelike genre. Each object, each animation, and each bit of text is a bit of paint on the canvas. Over dozens of playthroughs, a greater theme will be revealed to players.Over the next couple months, we’ll share more progress on the game.  If you’d like to be kept in touch, please sign up for the Spry Fox newsletter, or follow us on Twitter or Facebook.Wow, that looks gorgeous. I’m so intrigued by the concept–can’t wait to play this!Awe-inspiring! Will be waiting.Looks great! Will this be a pc or mobile game?+1. What platform will this be on? I loved TT on iOS but I would totally play this on Steam or Vita.Oh boy.

Goodnight Groddle.I’m excited for this! Shiren the Wanderer and Brogue are two of my favorite games of all time. I love that you’re exploring the multi-playthrough approach to narrative.Wow, very nice guys, graphics are delightful. Do you have any mailing list for notifying users when you launch? That would be great.Linux please 🙂I agree. Linux please.Mac please.Looks amazing, and this former glitch player can’t wait to try it! 🙂Awesomesauce… KUKUBEE!!!It’s so beautiful, and looks as though it may be a tribute to Glitch in a way.

      "It’s always nice to come across a game that doesn’t have the words ‘space’, ‘war’, ‘marine’ or some combination of the three in the title. Road Not Taken - if you were not aware - is the name of a Robert Frost poem from the Mountain Interval collection. Typical interpretations of the work say it is about looking back at minor events and attributing blame for things that came after; that these minor events can be attributed with more meaning than they may deserve.Originally released two years ago for PS4 and PC, the-game-with-the-same-name is an action/puzzle adventure that explores the ideas discussed in the poem, with a roguelike system that ties the whole thing together. So how does the iOS fare?On the surface, Road Not Taken looks almost whimsical in its art direction, with some subtle animation in the environment and on characters, plus some bright and very bold colours. Yet there is an underlying sense of darkness in some of the design and audio that I appreciate. Underneath the bonnet is a game that uses compelling puzzles with simple controls and a user interface that overall is elegant and translates superbly onto iOS (don’t worry folks, the Android port is on the way). Swiping in a general direction will aim your avatar that way, while tapping on an object will lift it in the air, tapping once more sends it flying over to the other side of the screen.The goal is to survive 14 years (levels) and to save the children that have ended up lost and send them back to their mothers. The little blighters manage to get lost at the same time each year, and each year without fail the mayor comes running to you for help. How does this guy stay in office? The solution to this situation is less elegant, as It involves you flinging the children towards their mothers. It has similarities to the excellent Binding of Isaac, with procedurally generated levels that are set in square shaped rooms with different elements, and if you die you begin back at year one.Moving doesn’t require energy, but picking up and throwing objects does, plus objects that you carry around will drain you even further, so with that in mind you want to preserve your energy as best as possible. You have a flame in the corner that tracks how much you have left, and when it reaches 0 it’s game over. A portion of the energy you preserve passes over to the next level as well, so it’s something you have to stay wary of at all times – playing into the poem’s themes of every minor event having a bigger meaning to them. This also means that this is a puzzle game that doesn’t allow you to poke at it until it makes sense. Instead, you have to plan ahead for each move and decide whether it’s worth executing.You use a book of secrets (basically a log diary) that helps you understand what the elements are in the environment and how you can interact with them. A basic example is crafting wood into a log fire, which allows you to move around and pick up objects within that part of the level without loss of energy. Early runs with the game were more about experimentation to see what was possible, and I appreciated the game spending less time telling me what to do, and leaving me to try things out for myself. Items can also be thrown from one room to another, so sometimes puzzles are not in front of you. There are also different animals, creatures and spirits that have their own behavioural patterns that are also recorded into your diary. Some are friendly, some are not.Between levels you can interact with the townsfolk who will part wisdom or different upgrades depending on the items you collect and are willing to part with. These upgrades can be crucial to your survival, so it’s important to be on the lookout for berries and coins as you traverse through the forest. There’s something to be said as well for your avatar; the nameless protagonist has a charm, and the eyes are designed to give plenty of life and character.The big kicker when it comes to Road Not Taken is how punishingly difficult it gets. The spike in difficulty is way out of balance, and it’s surprising that even two years later, there doesn’t feel like it’s had much tweaking to try and balance some of that out. As mentioned, the your diary helps to keep track of what works with what, and to begin with these combinations are fairly obvious. As you progress further however, the lines of common sense and just-plain-made-up start to blur. And for a game where experimentation does not feel like such a risk in the early stages, the permadeath mechanic used here is an absolute pain towards the latter half of the game. Though in some ways that is the point of the permadeath mechanic, so you’ll need to play for yourself to see if you have the patience.While this may sound like a turn off to some, Road Not Taken is definitely worth checking out. The energy meter constantly looms over you while you make your valiant effort to save the children, and it keeps a good level of tension raised at all times. There is a checkpoint mechanic; but seeing as you lose all your items if you restart from there you’ve already signed your own death sentence. The iOS port is perfect for picking up and playing one session at a time and the lack of twitch-based movement makes it a viable option on the go as well.Without context this probably makes little sense.The character designs are equal parts adorable and weird.Darkness... imprisoning me.A major difficulty curve will turn off some, but don’t let this gorgeous yet tense rougelike pass you by.Log in to join the discussion.",

Email support@spryfox.com!Rarely does a game throw us like Road Not Taken did—but in a good way. Its fairy-tale visuals made us think haunting adventure game, and that’s in there. The gameplay has puzzler-style matching, tough roguelike random levels and a town hub where you sweet-talk someone into marrying you. Unique, right? It takes a little getting used to, but we ended up fascinated by how it all comes together so beautifully.I first played Road Not Taken on Steam over a year ago and had a lot of fun with it. I think this is a good port to mobile, and a steal for a dollar in comparison.This is a puzzle game where the mechanic you use is picking up everything in the four tiles adjacent to you, and drop them, which will shove those objects to the farthest tiles in their directions until they hit another object or the forest wall. The challenge is figuring out how to minimize the moves you make to conserve energy, with a main goal to reunite children to mothers per \"room\" of the forest. Sometimes instead of children, you have to group objects together to open doors to the next room(s). And of course there are more enemies/obstacles as you progress that you have to plan around.A lot of people think this game is hard at first, and so did I. But then you really get into it once you start learning what objects and enemies do through experience. It does take some patience in that respect. But it is a really fun game for puzzle lovers, and would be great to take on-the-go.I'm on my fifth play-through. The puzzles started out very confusing, but it starts to make sense before long. And new discoveries along the way keep it interesting and make it more rewarding. (The controls also get much easier with practice.) I recently shifted to playing on Difficult mode, and that adds some new interest as well.Meanwhile, the world is delightful—I enjoy the art, the sweet and quirky interactions with villagers, and plying them with gifts until you can propose marriage. (You can marry the whole village if you want to, regardless of gender! I love it.) I haven't managed to get my character to have their own children yet, but I think it's possible. Altogether a charming game.FYI, it is not possible for your character to have kids. One of this game's themes is that life doesn't always turn out as you hope/expect (or as society hopes/expects of you), and the inability to have kids is one way we try to communicate this.",

      "Life can take many unexpected turns; failure or success at a key moment can mean the difference between heartache and bliss. Road Not Taken is an action/puzzle adventure with heavy roguelike elements that explores that motif. Despite a few disappointing issues, the developers at Spry Fox have pieced together an artistic and absorbing experience that touches upon themes of love, loss, and, ultimately, hope.Road Not Taken begins when you, a hooded ranger, push through a blizzard and catch a boat ride to a snowy village. Its population is scarce. A few lonely figures wander the streets, and you soon find the mayor waiting on the east end of town. He promises you a roof over your head, but in exchange, you must lead the search for children who have gone missing while attempting to harvest berries in the harsh elements. That means wandering through a randomly generated region filled with hostile wildlife and other objects that stand between you, the children, and their parents.Gameplay is divided between two areas. In town, you talk to villagers and learn their stories. One person might come from a wealthy family, for instance, and money is his language. Another feels the ticking of her biological clock; she yearns for a future with a house and kids, but there's no guarantee she'll ever find it without your aid. As the wandering refugee, you engage with the characters, handing over coins, rice, berries, medicine, or rabbits you have obtained. In exchange, you learn more of a specific character's story and perhaps gain new information for your records, or a charm or temporary energy boost. Your relationship can grow to inspire love, envy, or even marriage.When you're not busy turning strangers into friends, you wander a wasteland that resembles a dungeon in The Legend of Zelda. Your magical staff allows you to lift adjacent objects (up to four at a time, one on each connecting side) and carry them or hurl them outward. Each item you might heft behaves differently when it connects with the proper obstruction. Often, such items simply fall in place, but sometimes you match the proper items; two orange spirits and a blue well of fire turn into a life-restoring apple, for instance, and combining a couple of sticks produces a fire. As you experiment and talk with villagers, you learn about other useful combinations.Not every match you make is beneficial, so you should think carefully before you lift anything. Once any objects are lifted, you can't simply set them down again. Instead, you must either throw or carry them. The latter activity drains your energy meter with each step you take, unless a cheery fire is burning nearby. You need to make sure you don't produce an unintended match, and you also must be careful not to throw something so that it lands near another object you have no interest in subsequently lifting. Mobility is also a factor, since you can't squeeze through tight spaces if you are toting around too much junk. The amount of planning this sometimes requires can be intimidating, especially in later areas.Screens in a given region are usually blocked by obstructions that disappear only when you make a specific match, and sometimes the necessary ingredients aren't all on hand. In that case, you must backtrack and toss the desired item--a tree, or a block of ice, or skittish wildlife, or something else of that nature--through an opening. In other instances, you might stumble across a wolf surrounded by deer. The carnivore will eat the other animals if you don't act quickly, perhaps eliminating your opportunity to ever advance to adjoining screens.Situations such as the one noted above pose a serious problem, because children are located at the far reaches of each randomly-generated area. If you let a bit of bad luck or poor planning prevent you from reaching too many such screens, or if you carelessly carry items too long that could instead be tossed, you won't be able to save enough missing youths to meet the mayor's quota. If you fail twice or if you run out of energy, your fifteen-year run is cut short and you must start fresh.Frustratingly, you don't keep anything important from one cycle to another. Neighbors and wandering adventurers you meet in dungeons sometimes give you charms, and you can equip two at once by default. Those charms do helpful things like reducing the number of children you must find, or causing restorative items to have a greater impact. One particularly great charm adds 200 points to an energy meter that otherwise might hover near 60 or 90. If you fail to complete the cycle, though, you lose it and might not find another to replace it for several more cycles. You do at least retain the ability to \"ban\" a standard maximum of two objects from the wastelands by visiting your basement, but there are dozens of items to worry about, and the option to eliminate only a couple of them hardly matters. Charms are significantly more useful, so it stinks to always lose them.Road Not Taken is a difficult adventure, one that suits its name perfectly. Though you will likely fail many times as you attempt to finally reach the end of a cycle, there is almost always something to lure you back. Maybe you had almost reached the end of one character's story, and you are dying to see how it concludes. Or perhaps you discovered a new technique or combination, and now you'd like to put it to proper use on a subsequent run. There is something novel to discover on nearly every run, and online leaderboards provide yet another reason to keep trying again.Unfortunately, the game currently suffers from some irritating bugs. Patches may address that eventually, but right now crashes often happen at a rate of several times per cycle. You can even lose your save file in the event of a severe crash, which makes their frequency distressing, even though typically you resume on the exact screen where you last played. Combine the lack of stability with the occasional cheap combinations of randomly generated rooms (not to mention your inability to keep charms from one cycle to the next) and you're left with a punishing experience indeed.On a brighter note, the art style is charming and even uses some familiar icons from Triple Town, a popular mobile game from the same developer. The sprites are expressive and vibrant, which allows the game to spin bleak stories without getting overly depressing. Music is atmospheric, with a lot of the chimes and bells that always seem to accompany wintry landscapes in film and games, accompanied by haunting gusts of wind and the faint sobs of distressed parents.Road Not Taken is an ambitious endeavor, a substantial puzzle adventure with that special something that keeps you returning for yet another trek through the harsh wilds. It's sometimes too unforgiving for its own good, but the urge to travel along another path is difficult to resist.We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.Use your keyboard!",

      "Nuclear Throne is a top-down shooter roguelike video game by Vlambeer. Early prototypes of the game were distributed through Steam's early access program in 2013. Nuclear Throne was released on December 5, 2015, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita platforms, with an Xbox One release due in the future.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nNuclear Throne is a top-down shooter roguelike game. The game consists of two main game modes: single-player, and a local cooperative gameplay mode. There are also daily and weekly challenge modes, allowing the user to compete against other players via the Steam platform for the best score (determined by the number of kills in the playthrough), on the same set of randomly generated levels. The player controls one of a total of 12 characters, 10 of which must be unlocked through play. Two additional secret characters can only be played under special circumstances during play. Each character has an ability unique to them, adding an additional element to the gameplay. These abilities offered by the game for each individual character allow different play-styles to be achieved by the player and improve the variety and replay-value of the game. Secondary sprites or skins can also be acquired for the characters played, if the player completes special or secret tasks. The player progresses through the linear level structure until level 7-3, where the final boss, the Nuclear Throne, has to be defeated. After this, the player may choose to loop to the beginning of the game again with a greatly increased difficulty. The user may continue looping indefinitely until death.\nThe game resets upon death. Except for special weapons acquired in a hidden level and “crowns” retained until after defeating the final boss, anything acquired in one play-through does not carry over to the next. The game has a leveling system, where the player gains experience in the form of radiation pellets, or \"rads\", dropped by enemies, that allows to get different mutations and choose what would benefit the character the most out of a selection of four, randomly selected mutations.Upon mutating 10 times the player can choose a character-specific “ultra-mutation”. As well as the available mutations being randomly generated, the levels themselves are procedurally generated, with every playthrough having a unique set of levels for the user to complete.\nThe player starts with the basic revolver, but they may upgrade by taking weapons from red chests and collect more ammunition by opening yellow chests. The player can have two weapons equipped at any time, such as a shovel and an assault rifle. The weapons available to the player get increasingly advanced and powerful as the enemies become increasingly difficult and numerous. Weapons utilise different ammo types, with there being currently bullet, energy, shell, bolt, explosive and melee weapons. The user may also use powerful Ultra Weapons after reaching Level Ultra, following the completion of experience levels up to Level 9.\n\n\n== Development ==\nVlambeer's Jan Willem Nijman and Rami Ismail served as the game's designer and producer, respectively, and shared the development work. Paul Veer, who had previously animated Vlambeer's Super Crate Box, returned to contribute art to Nuclear Throne. The game's promotional art was drawn by Justin Chan, an art student hired on the basis of his fan art for early releases of the game. Nuclear Throne's music was composed by Jukio \"Kozilek\" Kallio, who had composed for several previous Vlambeer titles. A friend of Kallio's, Joonas Turner, worked on the sound effect design.Nuclear Throne development took 2.5 years, beginning in February 2013 and releasing into Steam Early Access that same year. During PAX Prime 2013 Vlambeer showed off the prototype for Nuclear Throne, Wasteland Kings, with five of the twelve characters playable in the prototype. After the release of Nuclear Throne to early access, this prototype was made for public download. It was revealed by Rami Ismail that the name change was due primarily to a trademark issue with inXile Entertainment. Vlambeer live streamed gameplay online for the public twice a week during development. Vlambeer announced PlayStation 4 and Vita releases at the December 2015 PlayStation Experience keynote.The game will see a limited physical release on the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita through Limited Run Games.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn January 2016, Vlambeer teamed up with the subscription box company, IndieBox, to offer an exclusive physical release of Nuclear Throne. This limited collector’s edition included a themed USB drive with DRM-free game file, official soundtrack, instruction manual, Steam key, and various custom-designed collectibles.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nNuclear Throne has received positive reviews from critics, with the game's PS4 version scoring 82/100 on Metacritic, and the PC version 88/100.Alexander Chatziioannou of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4 out of 5 saying, \"Nuclear Throne is impeccably presented and tightly designed. There is enough variety in characters, upgrades and weapons to ensure that playthroughs never get repetitive and its visceral combat is a joy in itself.\" Jordan Devore from Destructoid rated the game a 8/10 saying, \"it's one of the hardest, most rewarding games I've ever played. But as satisfying as it can eventually become, I think it is far too demanding for its own good.\"IGN awarded it a score of 9.0 out of 10, saying \"Nuclear Throne is an enjoyably tough run-and-gun with tons of energy and variety to justify hours and hours of replays.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Nuclear Throne at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website",
      "COMMUNITYCURRENT FEATURESGET NUCLEAR THRONE",
      "By\nEdwin Evans-Thirlwell\n2015-12-14T13:29:27.347ZReviewA crowning achievement for Vlambeer, and one of the finest action-roguelikes ever made.Nuclear Throne often resembles a foodfight in a particularly mucky branch of McDonalds, but don't let its showers of pixellated gristle deceive you. This is a precision-engineered post-apocalyptic roguelike shooter of insidious grace and flexibility, with every single moving part a source of terrible fascination. Take the Chicken, one of Nuclear Throne's unlockable characters. She doesn't collapse on death like the rest of the characters: head and body part company, instead, and you're granted a few seconds to guide her spurting torso towards a health pack and thus, a miraculous comeback. After a couple of runs, I've just realised that during these frantic searches, the camera stays centred on her lopped-off head—a subtle hindrance in a game full of wonderful little touches.Your overall goal is to overcome 15 procedurally generated levels, broken into seven themed areas (plus a small clutch of secret levels, amongst other surprises). Between chapters you can pick mutations for your character, which range from the prosaic—increased maximum health, or faster movement—to esoteric mutations that suit more advanced tactics, such as being able to tunnel into walls for shelter. One dramatically increases the force with which enemy bodies are thrown by a fatal blow. This transforms a bullet-hell endeavour into a question of banking shots and pinball table multikills—a lucky thwack with a wrench might clear out an entire corridor, saving you precious ammo. It obviously encourages aggression, as does the fact that Rads (XP points) must be gathered before they blink out of existence—rinsing that corridor in one fell swoop might cost you an upgrade, if you can't mop up all the Rads in time. But rushing forward to claim the rewards isn't the wisest tactic in a world that's home to assassins posing as corpses, to say nothing of flying diamonds who spit lasers from outside the field of view.Nuclear Throne's greatness lies in how all these variables and considerations pull against one another, giving rise to shifting layers of strategy, surprise and white-knuckle brinkmanship. For all its complex systems, though, the game is never less than intuitive, marrying responsive top-down shooting to a rocky yet predictable progression curve. The majestic audio design plays a big part in making the game accessible—that bombardment of yelps and splats is actually a nicely judged set of cues, allowing a halfway-skilled player to read a battle almost by ear alone.Map layouts and item drops vary hugely, but as with all the best roguelikes, there's enough uniformity between playthroughs that you can plan ahead. Each area theme (ranging from slippery ice plateaus to scrapyards and bejewelled cave systems) spans a fixed number of levels, boss encounters crop up at the same point in the sequence every time, and each layout is home to a certain number of weapon and ammo crates. This leads to some delicious quandaries as you weigh the needs of the moment against those of scenarios to come. A mutation that allows normal movement through cobwebs might prove decisive in a chapter or two, but a mutation that occasionally restores ammo when you kill something has wider applicability. Likewise, should you waste those bazooka shots on a murder of Uzi-wielding crows, or save them for the boss you know is just around the corner?Choice of character also, of course, shapes the the challenges ahead—besides a primary and secondary weapon slot, each protagonist sports an active and a passive ability that caters to a particular playstyle. The coward's bet is Crystal, who starts with more health and can transform briefly into a bullet-repelling chunk of amethyst (a later mutation allows her to teleport while in this state). A riskier pick is Melting, who dies easily but reaps a greater Rad haul per kill, allowing him to access powerful upgrades much earlier—oh, and he can blow up corpses from afar. Same screen co-op play allows you to explore how these special abilities may compliment each other: an Eyes player might use telekinesis to suck in ammo drops, for instance, while a dual-wielding Steroids player vomits bullets into a chokepoint.Given a certain degree of skill, the game can be completed in under an hour, but there are daily and weekly challenges with preset levels to dip into, and you can loop the campaign after beating a certain boss to replay levels with different mode criteria. Even without all that, though, Nuclear Throne is an experience you'll want to relive—for the inexhaustible joy of gliding through hails of ordinance, and for the many small discoveries you make every time you return to the wasteland. Roguelikes don't come much greasier or grubbier, but they're seldom this compelling, either.What is it: Lightning-fast top-down roguelike shooter in which squidgy mutants vie for possession of the eponymous throne.Publisher: VlambeerDeveloper: VlambeerReviewed on: i5, GTX460M, 4GB RAMExpect to pay: $12 / £9Multiplayer: 2 Player Co-op Link: Official siteA crowning achievement for Vlambeer, and one of the finest action-roguelikes ever made.Subscribe to get the best content of the week, and great gaming deals, as picked by the editors.PC Gamer is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

      "VlambeerBringing back arcade since 1985Vlambeer has been sort of quiet the last few months, and for good reasons. Nuclear Throne was by far the biggest project we’ve ever done, and combined with the livestreaming schedule and the stress of console releases, it took a massive toll on us. However, we did not spend half a year doing nothing, and we’ve got a mountain-sized blog post full of news.What we’ve been up to.\nAfter Nuclear Throne’s launch, we took a few months of time apart from each other to recover.We have been struggling with Nuclear Throne’s patch and some other backlog. The patch is an ongoing process (we’ve submitted for a new certification round this week), and has been rather embarrassing and frustrating for everybody on the team. Game Maker, our middleware, absolutely isn’t built for PlayStation updates, and Nuclear Throne being the first test case of a Game Maker game natively on PlayStation means that every problem we run across needs to be found by SONY, addressed by YoYoGames, tested by us, and then submitted to certification again. It’s been a slow, grueling, process. We take full responsibility for the delay, and we’re positive that we’re finally getting close.Jan Willem went back to prototyping, and creating small side projects to sling his creativity back into shape. He recently released a small “solo” project in the form of DISC ROOM, which is a collaboration between Kitty Calis, Doseone (who we also worked with on GUN GODZ & Nuclear Throne), and himself. It was available as a Humble Original in the Humble Monthly of August 2016. You can, however, still grab the soundtrack over on Bandcamp.Rami has been working on a lot of the Vlambeer-related stuff further up ahead, but he also spend some time making some “solo” stuff. One of his recent trips took him to a gamejam in a castle in Sweden, where he met a bunch of developers from all over the world. Together, they created a hotel maintenance simulation game in the shape of Breach & Clean, which is a freeware download.Birthdays! Patches! Updates! Fixes! \nIn the meanwhile, we’ve been working on some other things in the background. At the start of September, Vlambeer turns six years old! We’ve spent this first downtime in years fondly looking back at six years of ridiculousness and hard work with Vlambeer, but in looking back, we also found a young studio that made some mistakes along the way. We’re committed to fixing those, and while we’re cleaning house, we might as well make some other improvements.There will be updated freeware versions of Super Crate Box and GUN GODZ. Both will also release for Mac and Linux.There is an upcoming PC update for Serious Sam: The Random Encounter, and Mac and Linux builds will be added there as well.On mobile, we’ll be releasing a patch for both Super Crate Box iOS and Ridiculous Fishing in the next few months, enabling support for new devices and aspect ratios. We’re sad to announce that, as you probably expected by now, the Ridiculous Fishing content update will not occur. We’ve thought long and carefully about this, but Ridiculous Fishing is really perfect as it is. We simply couldn’t find a way to improve it in a meaningful way, and as such, we’d rather leave it as is, instead of adding things for the sake of adding them.We are happy to announce we will be working with Abstraction Games to try and bring a PS3 and PS Vita patch to LUFTRAUSERS. This patch will fix an old trophy problem some of our vocal fans have been asking about in more and less polite ways, and we didn’t want to disappoint those of you who asked politely.Nuclear Throne will get an update on PC, Mac and Linux in the course of this month. This will bring the game to update 99 on Steam, Humble and GoG, and will fix some of the remaining bugs. We are thankful to YellowAfterlife and Darwin from the community for their help in identifying and solving these, and to the entire Nuclear Throne community for their ongoing support. The PlayStation patches, when approved, will bring the game to update 99 on those platforms too, and fix some of the glaring problems of the console build.All of this made us a bit nostalgic! Going over our old projects, back to little games such as Dinosaur Zookeeper and KARATE, and old hits like Super Crate Box and Radical Fishing – it was quite a trip down memory lane. Vlambeer has been an amazing rollercoaster so far, and sometimes things moved so fast we can barely remember what happened.Announcement!We wanted to find a way to document our history, and we got in touch with the fine folks at Cook & Becker to help us out. They suggested the idea of a book. So, for the first time ever, Vlambeer is announcing a book.We’re really excited to announce 120 Years Of Vlambeer And Friends, an art & history book of everything we’ve ever made as Vlambeer. We’re excited about the whole thing, and since we’ve never released a physical product of this scale before, this is all rather exciting to us.Written by the writer of Killzone Visual Design, Arjan Terpstra, the book delves into our history, our designs, our process, and our projects. Arjan went and asked for full access to our archives, and he found design sketches, ideas and conversations we had all but forgotten about.The 120 Years Of Vlambeer And Friends edition is available at $39 and features the 256x256mm artbook with a blue cover. It is over 150 pages, full of beautiful art, and features a 20.000 word history of Vlambeer, interviews with the two of us and our team members. It’s filled with insights into our design, design sketches, history and our games.Then there is the signed Limited Edition, which is being printed in a limited run. Now, the contents of the book itself are identical, besides the cover being in bright red instead of blue. The Limited Edition comes in what we think is a beautiful 307x307mm box.In the box, you’ll find a numbered and limited art print, created according to Cook & Becker’s stringent quality guidelines. You’ll also find a custom Vlambeer notebook and marker to jot down your own game ideas or thoughts. Finally, you’ll find a collection of all of our games (& some additional prototypes). Each of the limited editions will be hand-signed by both of us. The Limited Edition sells at $93,50.It turns out that as far as we’re aware, no independent developer has ever tried doing something like this, so we couldn’t ask around for help with this project. Luckily, while we’ve never released a book before, the folks at Cook & Becker have. They’ve been guiding us through the process patiently and according to all estimates, the books should ship around the end of this year.Pre-orders for both editions are available through Cook & Becker right now, with worldwide shipping.In the meanwhile…The fact that we’re making a history book doesn’t mean Vlambeer is history. We’re continuing work on merch, new prototypes and ideas, and our aim is to maybe make a few smaller games to recover a bit. We have a few ideas that could be interesting, but they’re all very much up in the air – we haven’t picked one yet, and we don’t know if they’re worth following up on yet. There is one prototype in particular that we’re really excited about, but we’re worried saying more about it this early on will jinx it.If you’re going to be at PAX West, come by our booth. We’re introducing a new Nuclear Throne shirt designed by Justin Chan at the show. Here’s a sneak peek, and like all our other shirts, will be available through Fangamer. You’ll also be able to play our Complete History Of Vlambeer Games, where we’ll have every single game we ever created available to play. Even the ones we’re less proud of, and even some prototypes we didn’t finish.",
      "Vlambeer are the developers of the game Nuclear Throne.",
      "I feel like most reviews of Nuclear Throne would start with the words “I hate you”, and this one is no different. I hate you, Nuclear Throne. You’re an unhealthy relationship that I can’t find my way out of. Time and time again I feel like things are going really well and then you slap me down and remind me that reality is here to ruin the day. I’m not good enough for you, I’m not what you deserve but damn it I’m going to keep trying until you accept me for who I am!This is the kind of emotion that Nuclear Throne evokes from me when I play it. It’s a top-down roguelike shooter with procedurally generated levels, incredible depth, and a difficulty scale that will make players throw controllers. Made by the folks at Vlambeer, known for Ridiculous Fishing and Super Crate Box, Nuclear Throne sports a pixel-esque look that seems to be more fitting to a mobile device than a console or PC, but still manages to work well on both. Players choose from a roster of mutants that have different special abilities, drop into a world populated by enemies, pick up different weapons, and kill said enemies using dual joystick aiming and the trigger for firing.The controls, at first, feel odd. Moving and shooting with two joysticks is nothing new but you don’t shoot with the right joystick, you just aim. On the PC you can use a mouse and keyboard and from what I’ve played of the PC version I have to say that it’s the way to play. Unfortunately, the mouse and keyboard give you expert-level precision that you just can’t get from the PS4 controller. This makes the PS4 version feel sub-par when compared to its bigger brother. The reason for that precision being such a big deal is that Nuclear Throne is filled with a lot of enemies and bullets.After the fourth level the game really starts to pick up. You have enemies coming at you from every direction and they’re all firing weapons, too. That means you’re doing your best bullet-hell dodging while also taking cover and firing back when you can. The left trigger is reserved for special abilities that are unique to each character. These simplistic controls ensure an easy pick-up-and-play experience with a ridiculous learning curve if you want to get good at the game. With a mouse and keyboard, Nuclear Throne is still challenging, but it feels more doable than with a controller. There are times when the PS4 controller feels like it can’t keep up, though thankfully that is not often enough to be too big of a detriment. Still, if you consider yourself a hardcore player of these kinds of rougelikes, I suggest you pick up the PC version.To take care of all those nasty enemies you have a large arsenal of different weapon types. Some shoot bullets, some shoot shells, others shoot explosives and still more shoot energy. The different ammo types encourage different play styles and I found myself adjusting and adapting depending on what guns I found in the world on a playthrough. On one run I was completely comfortable with my revolver and shotgun combo, which is rather basic and typically only available in early goings. On other playthroughs I made it a point to get a grenade launcher and precise lightning pistol to vary up my chances of success. The different weapons give the game legs by way of varied runs, an important quality in roguelike games. Most of the weapons I found in my time with the game were great; I only ever disliked one type of weapon and those were the crossbows, which just weren’t for me. Melee weapons also exist, and watching someone pull off a successful melee run is a thing of beauty.To make special runs like a melee run possible, Nuclear Throne has “mutations” that take place when you collect enough experience points, or rads. Mutations grant abilities such as damaging enemies that touch you, regenerating ammo or health upon killing an enemy, or an additional four hit points. Each ability has its uses and some abilities I thought to be useless turned out to be incredibly important to a successful run. I highly suggest watching some YouTube videos on the game to see what type of builds work for your play style.Just the fact that Nuclear Throne has these build options is a testament to its hidden depth. At first, I thought the game was a simple matter of kill enemies, get more health power-ups, and try not to die. Over time I realized how different combinations of mutations could really change the game entirely. On one play through, for instance, I finished a handful of levels without firing a weapon or swinging a melee weapon. On another run, I went for movement abilities and became an untouchable ninja of death and chaos.Nuclear Throne plays by its own rules and they’re for the player to find out. Some enemies explode upon death, killing you instantly if you’re too close. Other enemies play dead and pop up at the last minute to end your run in a flash. These rules also apply to the diversified roster of player characters. The large roster of mutants means you’ll have plenty of choices and each one can pull off useful abilities. Crystal, who starts with higher health than the other mutants and can turn into a crystal that deflects bullets for a short time, is a great starter character. Other characters like Melting are for the more hardcore as it doesn’t have as many hit points but can make corpses explode and gains XP at a faster rate.There’s a great sense of style in Nuclear Throne and its one that gets realized to the fullest degree. Every enemy and asset feels like it belongs in whatever world you’re playing in, whether it’s a desert, an icy tundra, or a pyramid cyclops’ mansion. The only time the game felt iffy was when it slowed down during massive explosions. These momentary slowdowns felt awful in a game that requires precision and control at every turn. Luckily, they never seemed to be a problem when I was mid-run and were never responsible for a death. Nuclear Throne is a tough but fair roguelike, that much is true. My other odd gripe with the PS4 version is the pause menu. The pause menu defaults to the main menu button as the button you’d press if you were to press X. Typically if I pause mid-run it’s because I needed to answer a call or let someone in. If I didn’t remember to move the cursor to “Continue” I would accidently hit X and be sent back to the main menu without any “Are you sure you want to quit?” text boxes. It’s an odd thing to complain about in 2016 but it happened on several occasions.I had a lot of fun learning the ins and outs of each character and weapon and, like a good fighting game, I found the character I’m going to stick with. I played many hours of Nuclear Throne and I expect it to be the game I come back to the most in 2016. Nuclear Throne knows what it is and makes no bones about it. It’s a difficult, stylized roguelike with a clear vision of what it’s trying to achieve. Everything from the unique art style to the tough-as-nails gameplay makes it a rollercoaster of emotions whether you’re playing it for 15 minutes or 15 hours.Ultimately, Immortal Redneck has its share of issues but it’s a good addition to the rogue-like genre with decent FPS mechanics, an interesting setting, and a fun upgrade system that’ll keep fans coming back.But at the same time the unfortunate business model of Hero League and the sense of the grind in this meta-game of collecting and leveling up heroes takes the fun out of the parts that are enjoyable. Perhaps with time Heroes of the Storm can age into something great, for now it’s worth checking out if you want to experience a different take on a popular genre.Rogue Legacy bridges the gap between the old classics of the SNES days and newer indie titles of this generation. Its old-school graphical look and amazing soundtrack mesh with its clever gameplay concepts to create something truly unique. While boss battles can create a bit of a grind and the occasional glitch is fairly noticeable, I truly enjoyed my time with Rogue Legacy. Its fluid mix of combat, platforming, and smart humor made me enjoy each of my 100+ run throughs just as much as any other. After spending nearly 20 hours with the game I can honestly say I’d love to jump right back in, if only to conquer the castle just once more.Trying to mix genres to create something new is something we’ve seen done dozens of times. The last game I remember taking the MOBA formula into a successful new area was Monday Night Combat, now called Super Monday Night Combat. The third-person action genre being mixed with the typically-top-down MOBA game world was an interesting mix. Archeblade feels fresh and interesting at first but it soon degrades into a crazy melee of characters jumping around and attacking as clunky animations prevent the game from really capturing what is so unique about it. Overall it’s hard to recommend a game that feels so lacking, both in terms of quantity and quality.The Bug Butcher takes an old, proven formula and brings it into the modern era. Many games have taken the Galaga style and slapped a fresh coat of paint on it, but The Bug Butcher does more than that. The game takes the formula we all know so well and adds a great look, some fun power-ups, and interesting enemies that keep the game fresh for its short duration. While The Bug Butcher won’t be amazing gamers with its unique premise anytime soon, it’s a game that is well worth playing for a handful of hours.",

      "Nuclear Throne is pure chaos: an explosive, gun-slinging romp through a post-apocalyptic wasteland that marries the frantic energy of bullet hells with the tactical risk assessment of a roguelike. Boasting a mean arsenal of weapons, from standard revolvers to plasma cannons, it packs a big enough punch to draw in fans of fast-paced run-and-guns, but also demands a patience and strategy that rewards slow and methodical players too. With a cast of colorful characters to choose from and a simple leveling system that grants fun new skills as you progress, there’s no shortage of unique approaches to play… which is good, because coupled with Nuclear Throne’s unforgiving level of difficulty, you’ll probably be playing a lot.A game of Nuclear Throne can be over in an instant, but because it rewards you so often, with frequent weapon pick-ups and fancy skills, every failure feels like a fresh new beginning: an opportunity to learn and grow your character in interesting new ways.Part of that is owed to its excellent balance of randomness and familiarity. Like any action-roguelike hybrid (see: The Binding of Isaac and Spelunky), Nuclear Throne’s levels, enemy spawns, and item pick-ups are all procedurally generated. Themed levels grant a degree of consistency, so while you may never get the same layout twice, you’ll still have a general idea of what to expect each time you enter a new zone. This is super valuable for planning ahead, which plays a major part in mastering Nuclear Throne’s challenges. It may be a shoot-em-up, but rolling into battle with even the biggest guns blazing will only get you so far.The bulk of Nuclear Throne’s strategy manifests in its engaging skill system. Downed enemies drop radioactive energy, or rads, which act like experience points. If you’ve cleared a level by annihilating all enemies and earned enough rads to level up, you get to choose one mutation out of four before moving on to the next area. Some skills are pretty basic, adding things like more HP and ammo drops, while others might build off of your character’s existing ability, buff certain weapon types, or make enemies weaker.It’s super satisfying to pile on your favorite mutations over the course of a playthrough until you have that perfect build, but part of overcoming Nuclear Throne’s difficulty means experimenting with the constantly shifting tweaks that each new skill provides. With so many mutations to choose from, you might not always be given the options you want, which is part of Nuclear Throne’s exciting unpredictability. It forces you to change up your playstyle, work with the tools you’re given, and continue to adapt, ultimately making you a better player without holding your hand.Despite its difficulty, Nuclear Throne is extremely accessible. Uncomplicated controls, a simplified leveling system, and clear goals make it really easy for casual players to jump right in and know what they’re doing. For committed players, there are hidden areas and shortcuts to be unlocked, rare weapons to be found, and secrets to be discovered, and while the complexities of Nuclear Throne’s action may not seem as immediately deep as similar games like Spelunky, it still has a lot to offer for those with the time to seek it out.Unfortunately, Nuclear Throne does suffer from occasional crashes, which is a huge pain in a game where progression can’t be saved or reloaded. It didn’t happen frequently enough to put a dent in my positive experience, but I was also lucky to never have it happen while I was going up against the last boss.Rolling into battle with even the biggest guns blazing will only get you so far.Despite its difficulty, Nuclear Throne is extremely accessible.Nuclear Throne might not be a super complex game, but it is a compelling one. Its action is brutal, over-the-top, and rewarding; a hyperactive arcade-style shoot-em-up with enough dynamism to keep me captivated moment to moment, but a strong sense of strategy to give me something to invest in over longer playthroughs. Whether you want to sink your time methodically making it to that elusive throne or play in quick, punchy bursts, Nuclear Throne is an excellent choice either way.We encourage you to read our updated PRIVACY POLICY and COOKIE POLICY.",

      "Now I've become death, the destroyer of worlds...\r\nRobert J. Oppenheimer, quoting the Bhagavad Gita.\r\nAfter detonating Trinity on 07/16/1945.The most destructive weapon ever created by mankind, and on the other hand, they kept peace during last 60+ years. And of course such a weapon couldn't be\r\ncreated without the most brilliant scientists involved. Einstein, Bohr, Sczilard, Fermi, Feynman, Oppenheimer, Carter - these are the people who designed and created nuclear\r\nweapons. As Enrico Fermi said once - First of all this is a very interesting physics, yes, it is, but it is also the deadliest weapon ever created.\r\n   \r\n\r\nSo, whenever you look at those pictures, remember what nuclear and thermonuclear weapons are and what they can do. This page is not the place for a debate about nukes. They did\r\nhave(and still have) their place and served their purpose well in preventing WW III. It is my belief that not every freak in this world should be able to gain access to nukes.\r\nUnfortunately, certain number of cretins will destroy anything and everything for their cause, including themselves and the cause itself. I don't really care about the\r\ncause, for there's no justification for doing that.   \r\n\r\nI'm not going to place here detailed information about many aspects of nuclear weapons, that'd be too much. There are thousands of sites and apps such as nukeblast, nukemap, which can provide more specific information about\r\nnuclear weapons and their impacts. I'll provide just some facts regarding the tests in the past. I'm trying to create something like a database of the surface/atmospheric nuclear\r\nexplosions, so different sources are used to collect data and pictures.   \r\n\r\nNevertheless, I assume some facts regarding particular tests are very interesting, so I've decided to include it wherever possible. Besides, I wanted to have test info available\r\nwith the picture, to make it more convenient. Hence the info panes. In short, when you are viewing the picture, if I have the pane created for it already, there will be a bar above\r\nthe picture, indicating the test name, and the link next to it to view more info. For later browsers, the info pane is shown in the same window. If you are using some anicent\r\nbrowser, then the info page is opened in the separate window. The work is in progress, so I'm adding info as I have time. Hopefully it won't take too long tom complete the job.\r\nAlso, obviously I don't have access to many sources, so any help is appreciated.Last updated - 04/16/16Nuclear Pages\nMain\nCalendar\nTests Db\nImage Gallery\nGlossary\nCreditsMain Menu\nHome\nDesert Eagle\nFirearms\nNuclear Weapons\nComputers\nKnives\nFlashlights\nDigital Photography\nMovies\nMusic\nBallistics\nTrans Am\nZBlog\nSearchGuestBook\nView\nSignImportant DatesNuclear Tests DBMushroom Cloud Image GalleryThanks & CreditsGlossary"

    "title": "Hand of Fate",
    "text": [
      "Hand of Fate is an action role-playing video game developed and published by Defiant Development for Linux, Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, released in February 2015. A PlayStation Vita version was announced but ultimately cancelled due to development issues.Hand of Fate has the player work their way through randomized dungeons, generated by cards selected from customizable decks, to try to reach a final boss of each dungeon. Most of the game is played through an in-game tabletop tableau, with the player's actions narrated and executed by the mysterious Dealer, at times requiring the player to make choices to proceed. When combat occurs, the game switches to a third-person perspective brawler-style game, requiring the player to time attacks, blocks, dodges, and other abilities to defeat enemies without losing all their health. As the player progresses, they can earn tokens, which, upon completion of a dungeon (successfully or not), gain them additional cards that they can used to customize their decks for the next dungeon run.\nHand of Fate received generally positive reviews, and led to the successful crowdfunded physical variation of the game. A sequel, Hand of Fate 2, was released in November 2017.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nHand of Fate is an action role-playing video game with roguelike and deck-building elements. The player takes the role of a nameless hero that meets a strange Dealer voiced by Anthony Skordi, in a \"cabin at the end of the world\". This dealer narrates the player's adventure, dealing the game's cards, rewards, penalties, lore, and commentary. He also serves as the primary antagonist for the game.\nOn starting a new game, the player is given a starting deck of cards, consisting of equipment, hero class, and encounter cards. The player earns more cards as they progress in the game, which they can use to customize their deck up to a fixed size. Furthermore, the dealer has his own deck from which surprising elements such as more challenging encounters and monsters are drawn that also grows as the player gains cards and progresses through the game.\nIn the game's Story Mode, the player must defeat thirteen bosses: twelve court cards and the Dealer himself. These bosses, representing the royalty of each suit, must be defeated in order, but the player can return to previous bosses to challenge again and unlock new rewards. After a certain number of these bosses are defeated, the player also unlocks Endless Mode, which provides an infinite number of \"floors\" of increasing difficulty for the player to challenge with every card they have collected up to that point.\nTo progress in Story Mode, the player must complete a \"dungeon\" by exploring two or more \"floors\" created by a tableau of randomized, face-down encounter cards dealt from the combined deck of both player and Dealer. In addition to random encounters, each floor also includes either an exit encounter that lets the player reach the next floor, or a boss encounter on the final floor of that dungeon. The player starts with a limited amount of health, food, and initial equipment, modified by the player's selected class card and certain conditions obtained over the course of the story. To navigate each floor of the dungeon, the player moves a token across the tableau one card at a time, revealing it if face down. When each card is encountered, the Dealer narrates the event and resolves its effects.\nEvents can include meeting non-player characters, shops to buy and sell cards that benefit the player for the remainder of that dungeon, enemy encounters, or chance events that may benefit or hinder the player. Some of these events include a tree of options that the player can choose, while chance is presented as four shuffled cards representing rates of success or failure. Each movement step consumes food, and certain events can cause the player to gain or lose health, food, gold, blessings, curses, or equipment. The latter three can augment the player's attack power, defensive power, health, speed, or provide special abilities or conditions both inside and out of combat.\nIf the player encounters a monster or maze of traps, the number and type of enemy are determined by cards drawn by the Dealer (if any). The game then enters a third-person perspective action mode, where the player can attack, dodge, reflect and counterattack enemies and traps represented by the cards that were drawn. Damage taken is reflected in the player's overall health, which can be recovered normally with food or at certain shops and healers. On completing some encounters, the Dealer will present special tokens representing new cards that the player will receive at the conclusion of that dungeon, regardless of whether they won or were defeated.\nIf the player's character loses all of their health (i.e., by encounter or starvation) or chooses to forfeit from the in-game menu, they lose that dungeon, and the board is reset after they receive their tokens. If the player successfully beats the dungeon's boss, they progress one step forward in the story. The Dealer awaits the player for the final showdown and confrontation, so the player must pay close attention to deck-building, strategy, tactics, and chance in order to succeed.\n\n\n== Development ==\nHand of Fate was first shown at the 2013 Game Developers Conference.  A playable demo build was shown to the public at PAX Australia in July 2013.  By this point, the game had been in development for under six months. Defiant Development are a team of approximately fifteen based in Brisbane, they described Hand of Fate as their \"first big push\" onto PC platforms following their previous mobile projects.  Like all other Defiant games, Hand of Fate is built in Unity.The game was part funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign.  It was one of the first Australian projects to launch on Kickstarter.  The campaign launched in November 2013 and concluded in December 2013, achieving its A$50,000 target.  Not only was the campaign a financial success, it also allowed Defiant to build an audience and get feedback on pre-release builds. A Greenlight campaign was launched simultaneously so that the game could be released on Steam, and the game was approved in January 2014.A week following the crowdfunding campaign, an alpha build was released for Kickstarter backers. A beta version followed in February 2014, and in July, the game launched for Windows, OS X, and Linux on Steam Early Access. The full version was released for Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 17 February 2015.A sequel, Hand of Fate 2, had been announced with a planned early 2017 release, but was eventually first released on November 7, 2017 for personal computers and PlayStation 4, with an Xbox One version to release shortly afterwards. The sequel will add more challenges that the player must meet to proceed in dungeons, stronger monsters to face in battle, and companions that can be gained during the adventure which assist the player in combat. Hand of Fate 2 will also release on the Nintendo Switch on July 17, 2018.\n\n\n=== Board game ===\nDefiant worked with the board game development company Rule & Make to transition the video game into a deck-building game called Hand of Fate: Ordeals. The board game allows for one to four players to cooperatively work together to process through quests in a similar manner as the video game. They sought about $22,000 in crowd-funding for publication via a Kickstarter campaign in May 2017; the campaign surpassed its goal within a day, and ended with more than $360,000 pledged.\n\n\n== Release ==\nIn July 2016, Defiant Development partnered with IndieBox to produce an exclusive, custom-designed, physical release of Hand of Fate. This individually-numbered collector’s box included a themed USB drive with DRM-free copy of the game, official soundtrack, instruction manual, Steam key, and several custom-made collectibles.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHand of Fate received positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Microsoft Windows version 81.58% based on 13 reviews and 78/100 based on 27 reviews, the Xbox One version 79.75% based on 12 reviews and 80/100 based on 11 reviews and the PlayStation 4 version 79.28% based on 18 reviews and 79/100 based on 15 reviews.The game sold about 400,000 copies across personal computers and consoles, and it was downloaded more than 1.5 million times as part of a free game promotion for Xbox Live.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDefiant Development",
      "We are incredibly pleased to announce that Hand of Fate 2 will launch November 7, 2017, on PC, Xbox One and PS4. Oh gosh, that’s so close!Quick! Check out our new trailer over at Game Informer while I have a quiet panic attack.Along with announcing our release date (November 7, 2017 - coming to PC, PS4 and Xbox One!) we’re also revealing our final companion, the Indomitable Ariadne of Stiegal. A powerful melee warrior, Ariadne brings a keen blacksmith’s eye to the battlefield, shattering the armor of even the sturdiest opponents. On the tabletop, her boundless optimism allows her to duplicate chance cards, dramatically improving the player’s odds of success. Players will meet her properly in the Strength Challenge, though keen-eyed adventurers may encounter her earlier than that.HoF2 has blossomed into a project that we are deeply proud of, with noticeable improvements to every element of the original game. It’s massive, too. What was intended to be a game of equal length to HoF1 has transformed into something roughly four times the size, bursting with new characters, new enemies and a fantastic variety of new challenges.We think Hand of Fate 2 is the best game Defiant Development has ever produced, and we can’t wait to share it with you. Mark November 7 in your calendar as the day you return to the Dealer’s table and once again…Draw your cards, play and your hand and discover your fate!PS. I couldn't let this opportunity slip by without showing off another couple of fantastic concept pieces from our artist, Nick Smith!The boardgame adaptation of Hand of Fate, HoF: Ordeals, is now on the third day of its Kickstarter campaign and has already hit the $100k mark. If you're yet to check out the campaign, head over to Kickstarter right now! Do it in another tab, though, don't just... argh....they left.That's fine! Those of you didn't immediately blast off to pledge can take a look at this fantastic coverage we've gotten from the gaming press community.Firstly, here's Man Vs Meeple's in-depth preview of the game and its components. I'm not too proud to admit that watching this made me realize I was handling combat incorrectly.Here's Geek & Sundry showing off some rather swanky looking painted miniatures.CNET says the game feels like a natural fit for the table, and that the components are gorgeous. You're too kind, gang.Quarter to Three thinks it's weird to see so much color on the cards, but isn't going to let that stop them backing the Kickstarter.And finally, here's Kotaku announcing the fantastic news that we smashed our Kickstarter goals in the first twenty hours. It was actually six, but hey... who's counting?Everybody in the studio is industriously putting the finishing touches on the HoF2 Preview (formerly known as \"the Beta\", but there's so much excellent content in there we've outgrown the term), but I wanted to show you a cool new artifact that you'll soon be able to play around with.Say you're tasked with defending a gormless farmer from a horde of skeletons. Problem, right? Not if you're armed with some Holy Purification bombs.Skeletons! I hate them. I don't even like to admit that I have one.Ready. AIM...POW.Let's take a look at that again in slow motion.Another farmer successfully rescued from their own foolishness.The bomb artifacts (there are three kinds. Collect them all!) are introduced in the Lovers challenge, and they're provided to you by a mysterious goblin in a false beard. Whoever that could be...The Lovers is one of the eight challenges you'll be able to try in the preview event. If you still haven't signed up, there's still time! All you have to do is join our mailing list on the HoF2 page.PS. That was a clever headline and I regret nothing.It's time to harass another game developer in the middle of something much more important! This time it's designer Anna Zou, the former intern responsible for the creation of HoF's beloved mischievous goblin mentor, Mr Lionel.Lee: Who are you again, and what do you do at Defiant?Anna: I'm Anna and I do design-y things.What were you doing just before I interrupted you with this interview?I was working on the CENSORED Encounter Chain.Oh man, I'm going to have to bleep that name.yeah, whoops.I was working on a secret companion's encounter chain*...writing text and trying to resist making any more potato-related jokes.Potato related jokes do seem to take up a lot of your time at the moment, so I'm going to return to that later. But first, how did you get your start with Defiant?In the third year of my Games Design degree I somehow landed an internship at Defiant. Then I got contracted on part time as a Junior Designer. Then I went to Japan for a year to eat all of their sushi and pat all of their tiny dogs.\nDuring my time over there, I got offered a full time position as a Designer so I flew back and it's been jolly good times ever since.I can't say for certain why I was offered this position - probably because I threatened a lot of people, but I can't be sure.Should I speculate on why?Well, you already sound crazy. Now I need to know why you think you got the job.Apart from the threatening, I didn't do much of note during my time as Junior Designer. I did make the encounter Mister Lionel, and apparently people liked that, so presumably, that is a reason why.We had to lock down Mister Lionel. Didn't want you going off to a competitor and creating the hilarious hobgoblin Doctor Leonard for them, subsequently weakening our brand.Yeah I'm pretty locked down - that was the extent of my creativity so....But I can tell you why the community responded to Mr Lionel - you get him in your deck relatively early on so more players experience him, the card has multiple outcomes, there a very tangible benefit in getting a shield, and the encounter itself is just weird enough to be memorable long after the game is over.Weird enough to be memorable is my motto in life.I'm getting that on a shirt for your next birthday.Do you even know when my birthday is Lee? Hmm?That's why we have these interview questions, Anna!You just wanted to strengthen our friendship?Couldn't be stronger - we have an unbreakable bond already. Moving on, though. Do you remember how it was that you came to create the Mr Lionel encounter? Was there any kind of design brief, or did you just go \"A goblin in a fake beard is going to be weird\"I was tasked with looking over the analytics to see if there was anything I could fix. Before the Mister Lionel encounter there was a big spike at the end of the Queen of Dust challenge where players would die a lot, and it turns out the final fight was way easier with a shield.So rather than giving a shield to the player for this challenge, I thought it'd be more fun to make an encounter that gives you one, but also provides a place that player can gamble their things away, because gambling is fun, kids.So the encounter was a reaction to the data Defiant was pulling from the early access builds?Indeed.There's a hot scoop. That's one of the archetypal HoF cards and it only exists because players were terrible at the Queen of Dust! I hear that the recurring ghost encounter is also yours?The Queen of Dust is quite a trying fight without a shield I'd say, so really you could say we were the terrible ones for even making it like that.Yes, I've actually completely forgotten the name of the ghost cards. Probably because they weren't weird enough to be memorable.(Anna and Lee are talking about the Hand of Fate cards called \"Asleep in the Forest\" and \"Asleep at the Inn\". They're great.)That being said, I hope people cried genuine tears of sadness when they played those encounters. If not, then I'll be very disappointed in everyone, especially you.I bawled like a baby. Again, this is a sequence demonstrating one of the key conceits of Hand of Fate - despite being a card game that resets itself every session, your experience is persistent and the cards themselves evolve as you play. I think that took a lot of people by surprise - they were expecting a tropey dungeon generator but there's a narrative thread that carries through from start to finish.Yeah, that's something that I love about HoF too - that you unlock a new card and a world of potential awaits. As somebody who used to play those old text adventures on the computer machine, HoF definitely scratches that itch. Except it's better because it has pretty card art.Speaking of HoF too... you're now working on HoF2. What an elegant segue!You impress me more every day. Yes! HoF2! Should I say something else?The fun part about working on HoF2 is that I get to essentially play more of the game as other designers finish making encounters or challenges too. And then we critique them harshly, but that's also part of the fun!As a designer, what excites you most about HoF2 (beyond the obvious \"there will be more Hand of Fate!\")?I really like how HoF2 has more content for deck-building - not just in a \"win the challenge\" kind of way, but also in a \"I wonder what happens if I put this in my deck with this\" way. For example, what happens in an encounter can change depending on what Companion you took along or if you have a particular number of blessings etc.Creating encounters that make players want to experiment with their decks is exciting to me.Ooh, card synergies! Can you provide an example?Spoilers! Well I can say there's a blessing in the game that adds an extra Huge Success into the Chance Card mini-game, so even if the mini-game didn't have a Huge Success to begin with it would add one, and open up this new branch to the encounter that is previously undiscovered.I'm not sure if this is too much of a spoiler or not.WhaaaaaaaThat's amazing.And of course, companions may make their own little quips and comments on the encounters as you play.Thank you for bringing up our companion characters! Has their inclusion changed the way you approach encounter design for HoF2?Narratively, we're able to give more of a voice to the people in the HoF universe. Like what is Malaclypse's take on the scourge of corruption or maybe you can find out about what the deal is with the raiding Northerners from a Northerner himself, Colbjorn.So we took a new build to PAX East recently, and this build featured what might be your magnum opus - the Lovers challenge. Can I ask you about that? Can I ask about Oswin? What's the Deal with Oswin?You may not.(The Lovers challenge tasks the player with escorting a farmer named Oswin on a journey to meet his beloved. Oswin is notable for a number of reasons: he's incredibly handsome, he's obsessed with potatoes, and he can't stop getting kidnapped by skeletons.)I think it's pretty clear what his deal is - he likes potatoes and rightly so. Potatoes are the king of vegetables.You don't have to convince me.If I may be so bold.You may.Thank you.But yes, he seems to just be your run of the mill, friendly farming chap. One does wonder how he got into a relationship with such a woman though.You're creating a scenario where I have to go back and leave editor's notes in parentheses in this interview, Anna.Haha, yeah, should I be more clear (I don't want to spoil the Lovers surprise ending).It's fine, I can go back and provide a synopsis. This'll be crystal clear. What's the design intention of the Lovers? What are you trying to get the player to do/learn?Initially my design intention was to make sure that this challenge wasn't a typical story of two star-crossed lovers and that it had a distinct challenge goal - which is keeping a companion's health from dropping to 0. We also wanted bombs to be introduced, which tied in well with the keeping-Oswin-alive-in-combat thing.From there it all sort of evolved. I think a lot of challenges are designed like that, we have a broad topic with maybe some beats we have to hit, and then it changes and grows organically as we create and test and see what works.What do you think makes for a good HoF encounter?The writing has to be not crap of course, if it can surprise the players in some way, if players can use it for their nefarious deck-building purposes, if it is intriguing narratively...that is a general list off the top of my head.Personally I love encounters like the Devil's Carnival in the first Hand of Fate, something that draws you in and has many different branching possibilities on what happens. Some people, I'm sure, aren't a fan of encounters like that. Which is fine, because one of our goals as designers is to make sure that the encounters do different things and are unique from each other.And to close this out: what else do you like to play? What are you playing at the moment?Any sort of turn-based strategy game I'm into - XCOM or Divinity: Original Sin kind of games. That being said, I've been sucked into the addictive-ness that is Overwatch lately.Oh and board games! Inis is such a good board game.What do you like about Inis?For those who haven't played it, it's a game with a Celtic theme you have to place down as many of your dudes as you can on the map, or in particular regions. This is all affected by what Action cards you have in this round and what the other players have. It's just good fun to plan what you're going to do in your head and hope that everybody else doesn't counter you or do something you don't expect - which of course they usually do. You never know who's going to win.And finally: what is the goblin situation vis-a-vis Hand of Fate 2?Well, Mister Lionel has made an appearance in the game already if you played the last PAX build. Goblins are still around and stealing shiny things, despite the Empire's best efforts to stamp them out. Some have allied themselves with the Thieves Guild - as much as one can ally with goblins.That's what the people want to hear. Thanks, Anna!Thanks for having me!If you follow our social media accounts (and if you don't, what are you doing? Get over there, they're great!) you might have noticed some strange movements on Twitter. It seems the Dealer somehow managed to escape from whatever nightmare hellscape he's been residing in since the conclusion of Hand of Fate, only to find himself trapped in the wholly new hellscape that is Twitter.For a while, he seemed content to simply needle the designer of our upcoming Hand of Fate boardgame, or engage in a Dealer-Off with the talented voice actor, Anthony Skordi. That didn't provide the challenge he was looking for, however, and so last week he launched into a full pick-a-path adventure, polling the community to determine the protagonist's actions.The complete adventure follows, but be warned - the Dealer took to tweet-chains like a pro, so this is preeeeetty long.Are you still here? I told you he was wordy. All that trouble and he ends on a cliffhanger? Perhaps he'll get a chance to conclude his tale at a later date. Stay tuned for further adventures!We are as keen as you are to find out what’s going on with the impending tabletop adaptation of Hand of Fate, so we sent our communications manager, Lee, deep into enemy territory (or at least a hostile Slack channel) to get this interview with Rule & Make’s Michael “Barantas” McIntyre, designer of Hand of Fate: Ordeals!Lee: SO! Who are you, exactly, Michael?Michael: I'm 26, male, live in Brisbane with my lovely wife. I would describe myself physically as soft.Accurate. How did you end up designing the Hand of Fate boardgame?Well, the first time round or the second time? There is a fun story there. Well I think it's fun.Tell me the story!Well, sit back and let me spin you a tale like silk from chaff.A year or so back, maybe more... through the grapevine we had heard word that Defiant were wanting to make a board game from their super great game Hand Of Fate.At this point I had only played a little Hand Of Fate so I was intrigued. I was discussing the prospects of this with Brendan Evans, the designer behind Skyward. We were throwing around a few ideas but nothing really came of it aside from me playing a whole lot more Hand Of Fate. I got really into it.Fast forward a few months I'm working in a computer store and in walk some members of staff from Defiant. I end up serving them somewhat purposefully. (My co-worker regained consciousness later on) and I pitched them a concept right then and there, dropped them my details and waited for a response.I never heard back. Was I crushed, destroyed, heartbroken? Nope. This was a reasonable thing. I think I had come across as somewhat of a raving fan who wanted to show them how I had all the red string connecting pictures in my garage to explain who the Dealer really was.But no loss here. I always think, take every opportunity.But clearly, all that hard work and obsession eventually paid off.35% hard work 60% obsession 5% desperation.Moving further down the road, I'm working with Rule & Make. Doing conventions, spruiking merch and doing some design work when they mention Hand Of Fate. So I was like \"Oh yeah they were looking for a boardgame right? I was working on my own thing for that at one point.\" For a couple of weeks I didn't hear anything about it until I get a call one night. \"Hey, we would like you to work on the Hand Of Fate board game for us.\" I was so excited. But in a totally professional and reasonable way.From there everything has been a massive blur as we have been hammering out iteration after iteration of Hand Of Fate: Ordeals.Seriously, one day we will get to release photos of all the versions we have. It's crazy.So let's talk Hand of Fate: Ordeals. There's a guy in the videogame, and he's clearly sitting down to play a boardgame. Why couldn't we just print that?Short answer, the dealer really disagrees with being put away in a box every night. I have the scars to prove it.Long answer, so much of Hand Of Fate comes from your interactions with the Dealer and we wanted to bring you something newer and a bit different. Since we wanted the game to be multiplayer and we didn't want the game to run itself, we needed to reimagine the Hand Of Fate experience for you and your friends on the tabletop.Plus if you've already played Hand Of Fate you know the outcome, you know the story. So we're making something that builds on that and becomes its own beast.Okay, next question! Videogame-to-boardgame adaptations are becoming increasingly popular, but a good videogame design doesn't necessarily translate cleanly into a physical game. What are the pitfalls you've had you avoid with the adaptation?Combat and Literal Magic.We are really fortunate that Hand Of Fate is such an awesome genre mash of action combat and card game that we have so much that we can draw on to build this board game.That said, we can't have straight combat like HOF has. It just wouldn't translate right unless we strapped some sort of rockem sockem robots to the side of each game. So we have opted for something a little different. That's all under wraps at the moment, but our playtesters have given us some very positive feedback.Our other issue is that in HOF the dealer is literally magic. While we have tried our hardest to add the ability to make cards fly around the table into perfect piles, using incantations to defy the laws of physics by drawing energy from alternate dimensions was not within our budget. So we have had to capture the same deck building and board setup in a smooth and easy to do manner but sans the flying ball of cards.What have you done to capture the unique feel of HoF in the boardgame?The feel of Hand Of Fate I think is two fold.First is the genre mash that is deck construction + turn based dungeon crawler.Hand Of Fate has an amazing and rich world that is told through the encounters you discover and the cards you earn. We wanted to bring out that emergent storytelling within the board game as well.The meat and potatoes of Hand Of Fate is a punishing and gruelling trek against the odds in which the player is constantly tempted to push their luck in order to claim victory.In Hand Of Fate: Ordeals you are still driven to push against the odds and take risks, but you also need to be doing this faster and better than your opponents.Oh. And you will probably die.Nice.Obviously, I've been tremendous to work with, but what has it been like running playtest sessions with some of the designers from Defiant?It's been great. Stepping into the offices for the first time kinda made everything real for me. Everyone at Defiant has been really eager to play it and they give great feedback. Having Morgan play and watch the game had been pretty intimidating, but luckily he is a nice guy.It is really interesting to see people so involved in the property get cards and be surprised and excited as they realise what they are or how we have tweaked things for Ordeals.How has the game changed between playtests? Which battle plans failed to survive contact with the enemy?How long do you want this interview to be? laughs The game has changed so many times. It never started with a board, we went through so many iterations of how to get cards. I would be very keen to show all the steps we went through once people have had a chance to see it.Last one: what's your favourite thing about the HoF boardgame? What is it that you personally can't wait for the audience to experience?I really like the bit where you get to draw cards. Drawing cards is just my favourite thing.Hehe.But really. The style of the game is what I like most. It's the combination of rogue-like and deckbuilder that I enjoy the most. Being able to change up, each game, what I will focus on building while trying out new card combinations.Excellent. Is there anything else you think fans of Hand of Fate should know?I think that people should know that this game isn't just Hand Of Fate the board game. It really is its own thing. You can play this to get the same kind of experience as Hand Of Fate but also something new and interesting.Thanks so much, Michael. We'll have much more information on Hand of Fate: Ordeals soon!",
      "By\nEric Watson\n2017-11-07T21:38:24.31ZReviewHand of Fate 2 is a satisfying sequel and a meatier dungeon crawler, but still somewhat hampered by limited combat.My Fame score was too high. When I drew the Infamous card again, I was faced with a choice: fight my way out of an angry mob of peasants, or submit to a trial by fire. I opted for the latter and was presented with a rotating beam of light along a pendulum of moving blocks. When I failed to stop the marker on the right block, the Dealer cackled with glee. My heart sank as he drew Pain card after Pain card and my health dwindled into nothing. I should have murdered the damn peasants.Hand of Fate 2 is, like the original, a world literally made of cards. The campaign is presented as a world map divided into 22 challenges, or levels. These challenges provide specific objectives, and rules, and dying fails the entire challenge. Each challenge places a series of cards facedown on the table, like a digital board game. You move your token from card to card with each one revealing a new encounter that could mean potential gold, food, loot, or combat.The mysterious robed figure known as the Dealer returns from the first game, bearing scars he earned from it. He still introduces each challenge with acerbic wit, mocking every failure and adding a colorful level of commentary to each card I encountered. Oddly, the Dealer ends up a bit sidelined this time around, as the storytelling in the cards themselves has been greatly enhanced.The outcome of nearly every card is determined by either a mini-game of dice, cards, or dexterity, or a battle in a combat arena. Most cards offer interesting choices and different levels of risk and reward, from deciding whether to help or capture a thieving child to playing multiple games of chance with an ogre—or just fighting him instead.RPGs using dice rolls is not exactly a new concept, but it's new for Hand of Fate. The sequel smartly expands by adding multiple games of chance and dexterity to its unique card-based series of dungeon crawls. Additions like this make Hand of Fate 2 feel like a much improved sequel.Each challenge you unlock presents a different storyline with unique cards, rules, and objectives. I was impressed with how deeply some of them could alter the game.One challenge tasks me with gathering resources to defend a fort from a never-ending barbarian horde. It transformed into a turn-based strategy game as I avoided enemy patrols, discovered secret paths, and worked to efficiently gather wood and stone, all while still traveling between cards across the table.A particularly difficult challenge crippled me from the very beginning, leaving me with only 10% health and no way to heal naturally. I failed again and again, finally returning later once I had completed other challenges and acquired better healing and life gain cards to add to my personal deck. Unlocking new cards and strategically building my personal deck for each challenge remained satisfying throughout the campaign.Companion cards are one of Hand of Fate 2's best new features. There are four in total, unlocked over the course of the game. Each is unique, wielding useful powers in combat and on the strategic layer. Colbjorn the barbarian, for instance, can unleash an effective stunning charge in combat. On the card screen he can add an additional die to any dice rolls, which was often the difference between success and failure.Companions’ stories are told through a series of companion-specific cards, compelling tales of heartbreak, betrayal, and redemption. Companions are also woven into other cards’ stories and frequently chime in during BioWare-style cutscenes. These moments made the world feel much more vibrant and interactive despite how much of it is text.The last few challenges are a gauntlet of dungeon crawls as my team and I infiltrate a palace to embark on a little regicide. The finale presents its consequences based on how well you completed your companions’ storylines, kind of like Mass Effect 2. The final battle has a neat twist (and thankfully nothing like the awful QTE slog the first game’s end boss was), but still ultimately came down to a standard combat arena.Combat is unfortunately the least improved aspect of the sequel, despite still being a major focus of many challenges and cards. When you happen upon enemies the strategic card layer shifts into a colorful third-person action brawler. Weapons come in multiple styles which are now designed to tackle specific enemy types, such as light weapons against thieves. Each weapon has a built-in special attack that can be activated after a certain number of combo hits, with more powerful weapons capable of stunning multiple enemies or delivering massive blows. Attacks can either be blocked or evaded, and you’ll know which to use depending on if the attacking foe glows green or red.Enemy types are fairly limited and largely unimpressive, from standard barbarians, soldiers, and ghouls to a few interesting things like giant ogres and fire-spewing grenadiers. The arena background art and unit animations look great, but you’re still mostly just fighting humans in small spaces.By the halfway point in the campaign I saw almost everything the Dealer would throw at me. Later bosses scale up with more HP and armor, and regular enemies mostly rely on large numbers to offer any amount of challenge, which leads to awkward Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles-style enemy fights in which I would be surrounded by a dozen units while they politely engaged me one at a time—an issue which plagued the first game as well.At its best the rhythm of combat can be exhilarating. Many of the final battles in each challenge left me with a sliver of health as I quickly dodged to deliver the final blow, knowing that falling here would cause me to fail the entire 30-45 minute challenge. But in reaching that point most fights grew repetitive, particularly if I hadn’t yet found a decent weapon. It takes too long to kill anything even with the upgraded starting weapons, and you never have many options beyond frantically clicking, dodging, and occasionally unleashing your weapon ability or artifact. I also constantly struggled with the annoying fixed camera and auto-targeting. It never felt like I had firm control over my character.Weak combat would be a killer for most RPGs, but Hand of Fate 2 more than makes up for it in the vastly improved strategic layer, and lovely storytelling. The deck-building strategy remains satisfying and the new variety of challenges adds a roguelike replayability to obtaining the gold rank for each one. If the first Hand of Fate was an interesting but flawed proof of concept, Hand of Fate 2 is a fully realized version of that deck-building dungeon-crawler.What is it?

      "Reviewed on PC. Also available on PS4, with an Xbox One version due soon.The first Hand of Fate was one of those surprise gems that makes me proud to be a part of the Aussie games industry. Made by the Brisbane-based studio Defiant Development, the novel action RPG spliced simple yet well-polished arena battles with deck-building mechanics and choose-your-own-adventure style storytelling to produce a charming experience I've seen nothing like since. Well, until now.Defiant has taken the wise approach of not reinventing the wheel with Hand of Fate 2, instead opting to hone what made the first game so great and flesh out the areas that felt a little lacking. The result is a captivating Dungeons & Dragons-style adventure grander and more fulfilling than its predecessor, one that is clear proof that Australia is capable of making games just as well as anywhere in the world.For those who missed out on the first Hand of Fate, the basic framework of the game is this: the enigmatic Dealer sits across from you at a dusty table and lays his cards down to form an ersatz game board. You move from card to card as you please, with each card triggering a random event from the deck you've assembled. Events can be simple story tidbits that flesh out the world you're exploring; they can be games of chance for precious loot or gold; or they can be battle encounters with the extensive range of human and non-human foes the game has up its sleeves.Battles play out in small 3D environments, with combat aping the ever-popular Batman Arkham system of dodging and countering enemy attacks. Where combat in the original Hand of Fate often felt kind of clunky, though, battles in Hand of Fate 2 are significantly smoother, with each roll, block and swing feeling far more responsive and thus far more satisfying to pull off.That's not the only way Hand of Fate 2 has shaken up its hacking and slashing, either. New weapons like dual-wielded daggers and flame-spewing hammers have their own unique abilities, combos and animations, with each requiring different tactics to use effectively. I'm not going to lie: in the first Hand of Fate, I ended up mashing my way through a lot of the combat thanks to the way weapons handled. Thanks to the more-measured pace of battles and the smarter AI in Hand of Fate 2, though, that's no longer a viable strategy. Instead, you'll need to exercise your patience and pick your targets carefully, and that makes every victory feel all the more satisfying.Combat is hardly the only area where Hand of Fate 2 improves upon its predecessor. Story plays a more prominent role this time around, with a massive miniatures board serving as the overworld for your adventure. 22 challenges are scattered across the board, with a handful usually available for you to pick between at any one time. Each challenge tells its own self-contained story - and it's here where Hand of Fate 2 really shines.From piecing together clues in order to solve a murder mystery to hunting down relics on a card-based version of an open-world environment, the scenarios Hand of Fate 2 deals out are delightfully creative and constantly playing with your expectations of what is possible from such a deceptively simple card game. It certainly doesn't hurt that the writing is excellent, either, conjuring vivid scenes from simple sentences and dishing out plenty of witty black humour.As you're completing these individual storylines, multiple larger narratives start to unfurl themselves. Fellow warriors, former enemies and cowardly bards join you on your adventure as companions, and each has their own personal quest line you can pursue if you so wish. Again, the writing here is superb, and the only downside is the fact you can only bring a single companion into each challenge, meaning you'll likely need to replay challenges multiple times if you want to see every companion's story through. Thankfully, the random board layouts and shuffled cards ensure every attempt is distinct from the last.Then, of course, there's the Dealer. Returning from the first Hand of Fate, the gravel-voiced game master delivers his eloquent narration and condescending commentary with enthralling conviction, his role as both mentor and antagonist executed flawlessly. How and why he's back after his fate in the first game is something I'll leave you to discover on your own, but suffice it to say that his quest for vengeance provides plenty of motivation to forge through his challenges and see how it all pans out.Defiant has spent a lot of time shoring up the smaller details in Hand of Fate 2 as well. The visuals, for one, have received a significant upgrade, with detailed textures and extravagant lighting effects going hand-in-hand with a more vibrant art style to elevate the game from decent-looking to downright gorgeous. Difficulty, too has seen some small but important tweaks, with the need to manage food supplies less punishing this time around and the ability to camp and heal between encounters making the occasional run of bad luck far less frustrating.Perhaps one of my favourite little touches, however, is how almost every challenge has two objectives: one for simply completing the storyline, and one for going above and beyond to accomplish all side quests, too. Nothing revolutionary, sure, but it means you can still make forward progress without needing to repeat challenges over and over just because the cards didn't turn in your favour.We reviewed Hand of Fate 2 on PC with a copy provided by the publisher.For more information on how finder scores games, check our review guidelines.Defiant Development has proven that the first Hand of Fate was far from a fluke.

      "Video games long ago freed RPGs from the confines of the kitchen table, but some would argue something vital was lost along the way. The intimacy, unpredictability, and the friendly antagonism between Player and Dungeon Master. There’s a reason people still break out the graph paper and 20-sided dice even when there are much more technologically-advanced roleplaying options available.The Hand of Fate games attempt to combine that classic RPG appeal with more modern elements. Your adventures are literally laid out on a table by a shadowy card-dealing DM, but you also engage in real-time hack ‘n’ slash combat and other distinctly video-gamey things. Is Hand of Fate 2 a successful melding of old and new? Or should the game be thrown on the discard pile?Related Hand of Fate 2 Runs at 2160p on XB1X, 1620p on PS4 Pro; Dev Investigating Switch PortAs mentioned, Hand of Fate 2 pits you against the Dealer, who builds mildly-randomized quests, called “challenges,” using cards. They’re arranged on the table in different configurations and each turn you move one space, flip the card you landed on, and deal with whatever it throws at you. You may have to engage in a little “Choose Your Own Adventure” decision making, take part in a game of chance, or clash with a pack of baddies. As you make your way through the cards, you’ll also need to keep a close eye on your health, money, food cache, and level of fame.Each challenge is partly made up of its own unique cards, but before embarking you also choose your battle companion and a selection of encounter and equipment cards from your own deck. In theory, this gives you some control over how challenges play out, but, particularly at first, the effect is rather limited. The cards exclusive to each challenge are always the most important, and your deck simply isn’t varied enough alter things in an interesting way.Related Hand of Fate 2 Interview – Supporting PS4 Pro & Scorpio, Not Ruling Out SwitchTypically, I’d just choose the most obviously beneficial/powerful cards repeatedly. Why include, say, the Raiders Ambush card that may help or harm me, when I could just stick with the Arm Wrestling card that’s easy to win at and pays a ton of gold every time? It just didn’t feel like there was a lot of strategy to card selection. At least, not at first. Every time you complete a challenge, you’re awarded new cards and eventually your deck swells to the size where choosing cards becomes a bit more interesting. Even then, there still a lot of powerful, purely-beneficial cards you’d be a fool to leave out.Challenges are initially fairly straightforward but quickly become more creative. You may have to search for relics in a vast wilderness, deduce the identity of a would-be assassin, or gather resources to defend a fort from a barbarian horde. Some challenges aren’t so much creative, as they are sadistic – the less said about the one that starts you off with only 10 health points, the better. Hand of Fate 2 manages to convey an impressive array of different narratives with just a few cards strewn across a virtual table.While I admired the ingenuity of Hand of Fate 2’s diverse challenges, I didn’t always enjoy playing through them that much. Most the game’s events include an element of chance — a random card selection, roll of the dice, or blind decision. The consequences for failure are often nasty. Sometimes there’s no way to avoid punishment. Don’t like that your dumbass character just ate poison berries and permanently lost 25 percent of his health? Too bad! Once you learn the correct choices and strategy for each encounter you’ll be able to squeak by, but it may take a while to get there.Hand of Fate 2’s frustration factor is only compounded by its combat. Several times per challenge you’ll be whisked away to various 3D arenas, where you’ll test your mettle against packs of enemies. The battle system is simple enough – you can attack, dodge, block, counterattack, shield bash, activate you or your companion’s special move, and take out stunned enemies with a gory finisher. Imagine if Batman: Arkham Asylum looked kind of janky and didn’t handle particularly well, and you’ll have a good sense of what you’re in for. Arkham-style combat requires split-second timing, and Hand of Fate 2’s laggy, unresponsive controls aren’t up to the task. Whether or not your block or counterattack registers is pretty much a crap shoot, and enemies love to swarm you and attack from behind.The combination of randomness and uninspired combat means you’ll be dying a lot in Hand of Fate 2, and when you do, you’ll have to restart your current challenge from scratch. Played almost all the way through and died fighting the boss? Sorry, that’s 40 minutes of your life wasted. Worse, with the occasional exception, most cards are only gained by fully finishing a challenge. There aren’t a lot of options for grinding or improving through defeat. You can try to take on a different challenge, but if all the available options are just as difficult (as they often are), you may find yourself banging your head against the wall, hoping for a lucky run so you can finally expand your deck. The feeling of growth you get from a good RPG is lacking – as I built my deck I didn’t necessarily feel any more powerful.Hand of Fate 2 delivers around a couple dozen challenges, which took me about 20 hours to play through. Unfortunately, the game started to feel like a slog well before I reached the end. The game’s uninspired story didn’t help matters. Some individual character moments or bits of saucy dialogue are enjoyable, but the overall plot, focused on a loosely-sketched conflict between a powerful Empire, northern raiders, and dark magic wielders, is by-the-book fantasy stuff. The meta-story isn’t any more compelling – the game is rather vague about why you’re participating in the Dealer’s twisted game until near the end. It’s difficult to care about a game if you don’t know what you stand to win.This review was based on a PC copy of Hand of Fate 2 provided by publisher Defiant Development.Hand of Fate 2 captures some old-school RPG charm, but deals a few too many bad cards in the process. The game’s appealing premise is marred by unsatisfying progression, punishing randomness, and clunky combat. Nostalgic RPG fans will find things to appreciate here, but given the popularity and diversity of actual tabletop gaming these days, it’s hard to fully recommend the half-stacked Hand of Fate 2.Enter your email address to subscribe to our daily newsletter",

      "The original Hand of Fate succeeded largely on the strength of its concept. It combined the rules of a roguelike with a deck-building card game to create something unique, and the devious, ever-present Dealer made the whole thing feel like a single-player Dungeons & Dragons experience where the Dungeon Master was actively trying to stop you. It was a great idea, but had some major issues that held it back from reaching its full potential. It was a good game crying out for a great follow-up; thankfully, Hand of Fate 2 has delivered just that.In each of the sequel's 22 missions, you select several encounter and equipment cards from your personal deck. These are then mixed in with the Dealer's deck to form the card base you're playing with. The cards are scattered onto a table face-down, although the shape and structure they form changes on a mission-by-mission basis. As you move across the table turning over one card at a time (usually either looking for or moving towards a specific card), you're issued challenges that might or might not help you achieve the mission's goal. The outcomes of several situations are dictated by games of chance and skill--rolling dice, perfectly timing a button press to an on-screen pendulum, stopping a spinning wheel at the right time--and there are various stats you need to follow and maintain, as your character can run out of money or starve to death. There are also several cards that throw you into combat, at which point the game briefly turns into a third-person action experience until all your enemies are downed (or you die, failing the mission).While in the first game you were constantly on the hunt for the boss card, in Hand of Fate 2 there's far more variety in objectives, and the game is better for it. You usually still have to find and kill a boss, but each mission now has its own gimmick. These can include challenging you to work out which character of three is plotting a murder, or tasking you with escorting an innocent potato farmer. Each mission has a strong sense of identity and purpose, and many of them are clever.However, while the game gives you plenty of opportunities to escape bad situations or reasons to rethink your deck if your current plan isn't working, the start-over-if-you-die structure can sometimes be excessively frustrating in certain scenarios. A prime example is the Justice mission, in which you travel around the 28 cards laid out on the table, gathering resources and dodging enemies through games of chance, continually traveling back to your base card to use said resources to strengthen your fort. It's tremendous fun, but less so when you're killed an hour into it, right at the end of one of the many, many intense battles you've been made to fight. It's hard to pull yourself back into retrying a mission when these things happen. It also took me many attempts to beat the Strength mission, which starts you at low health and takes away your ability to heal by eating food. In a typical roguelike, where heavy randomisation makes the game feel different each time you enter, this wouldn't seem like a big deal. But the individual missions in Hand of Fate 2 often ask you to fight the same battles repeatedly, and replaying the more difficult ones over and over is a strain. Thankfully, until you reach the very end, you'll have multiple unfinished missions unlocked at any given point; if one is giving you grief you can usually jump into another.Hand of Fate 2's combat has gone through an overhaul. It discards the ineffective camera, clunky controls, and unclear parry cues for a system that feels much closer to the Batman: Arkham Asylum fighting system that so clearly inspired it. It's not a unique system, and the game lacks variety in both enemies and tactical possibilities, but it's now much more satisfying to take on a group of enemies. Parry and dodge cues are clear, and managing the timing of your attacks and moves requires active attention.You can equip different weapons before battle, which are divided into three classes (heavy, two-handed, and one-handed), and what to equip largely depends on your opponent. Thieves, for instance, are weak against blade attacks, which do little damage but let you attack multiple times in quick succession, while several different kinds of guard are easier to fight if you're carrying a one-handed sword and a shield. However, the more hectic battles can still be hard to read, and the quality of the fights may vary depending on which equipment you've managed to source during your journey--if you aren't able to find or buy useful weapons, it can turn into a slog. Luck plays a big part in Hand of Fate 2, and while you can manufacture better luck with a good deck, there's always the somewhat frustrating possibility that random chance will strike you down.In most missions you're joined by one of four unlockable companions who provide buffs during combat and specialize in improving your odds of victory in some specific circumstances. The mighty Colbjorn, for instance, can offer an extra die for you to roll should you need it in certain scenarios. These companions also add to the already rich incidental storytelling of the game. Playing through each mission, uncovering cards, and watching as conflicts and allegiances twist and shift depending on the story you're pursuing at any given point gives you a strong sense of the game's world, even if it's largely confined to text. The Dealer, who is once again voiced by Anthony Skordi, is a treasure of a character, repeatedly referencing events from the first game and hinting at the dark secrets he keeps stored somewhere within his robes. He's not an antagonist in the same way he was in the original game, and ultimately feels like a deeper, more mysterious character.The moments of frustration in Hand of Fate 2 are worth enduring for the sweetness of its adventures, and getting to know the different cards and learning to build a deck that is perfectly suited for the mission you're entering is satisfying. Hand of Fate 2 is a realization of the first game's promise, and it's exciting to play a game that blends seemingly unrelated elements together so well.We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.Use your keyboard!",

      "You find yourself in a caravan, a familiar face frowning at you. He spreads cards upon the table, corruption spidering beneath the skin of his hands like ink across parchment. He deals in tarot, but he is not a soothsayer, and you aren’t here to learn your future. You’re here to fight for it.The Dealer was the soul of Hand of Fate, and he continues to imbue the sequel with his winning personality. As the designer of the game, the Dealer is a mouthpiece for Defiant Development to discuss what is happening on the table with the player, to point out what is clever, and to reveal what has changed.And, oh, it often feels like he’s out to get you. He insults you, he overwhelms you with combat encounters, and he forces you to complete chance-based minigames to continue onwards. Each game - the card wheel, the precision pendulum, the dice game, and the card shuffling - are punishing. Whichever game the Dealer chooses never feels random, but there’s also an air of mystery around why. What makes that dice game perfect for this sidequest? Why does this challenge call for the pendulum?They each have the air of carnival games, in that they pretend to be about skill and strategy, but the results can always be manipulated by chance. But when the randomness of the game (and the games within the game) get the best of the player, it’s not the system that the player becomes mad at; it’s the Dealer.It goes against my instincts as a game designer. We’re always encouraged to incorporate as much meaningful choice into our games as we can; it’s important that players feel like failures could have been prevented if they’d done something differently, rather than feeling like the game system is unfair. Too much chance and you lose your players.But Hand of Fate 2 is all about treating you unfairly. Or just fairly enough. The Dealer, with his constant prodding, makes you want to come back and prove yourself to him.Maybe it’s because, for every frustration, there’s satisfaction in equal measure. Even when you lose the game, you can still break the tokens you’ve won and be rewarded with new cards. It captures the excitement of opening booster packs and adding to your collection, and of strategically deckbuilding in preparation for the next game.It’s not hard to be excited about collecting cards when they’re so beautiful. The entire aesthetic of Hand of Fate 2 is spectacular, though not surprising considering its predecessor. The new platinum and brimstone cards are particularly wonderful, and glimmer like the holographic cards that used to excite me when I opened a new card pack as a kid.Beyond the visuals, the audio also adds so much to the atmosphere of the game. Often it’s said music in games isn’t noticed or talked about by players unless it is particularly good or particularly bad, and in Hand of Fate 2 it’s definitely the former. The variation of success and failure sounds, the swell as something intense is beginning to happen in the narrative, and the little tunes played by the shifting pieces of the pendulum are haunting and perfect.Hand of Fate 2 finds the balance between tension and humour. An intense story about people living in a city overrun by disease sits alongside a narrative about protecting a man who is constantly crunching on potatoes while he tries to find his lover. Each of the stories is creative and varied, both in narrative content and mechanics, showing just how much can be done with the game system. Sprawling city landscapes made of cards, escort missions, and murder mysteries stretch the deceptively simple system to new levels, meaning the narratives never get boring.These modular stories are fascinating. Each area has an overarching narrative, but also has sidequests based on the cards you choose when building your deck. Some are repetitive one-offs, like being ambushed by goblins or visiting a soothsayer, while others are linear stories that you work your way through from game to game. The customisable nature of these stories and challenges allows you to visit narratives in a way that is unique to your playthrough, and to modify difficulty based on the cards you choose.Cards and stories are key to Hand of Fate 2, which only builds upon the focus of the original game. The series knows its audience - people who like words and people who like deckbuilding - and it creates a fantastic, niche experience tailored to their interests.Although the overall game is tight, there are a few flaws. At first I was amazed by the animations of the cards being laid out across the table, flown down to the combat arena, or packed up after a game is over, but these start to feel very slow as you repeat missions, either due to dying or through attempts to grind for better equipment. Hand of Fate 2 is a game that takes an eternity to lose; when you die, it takes at least thirty seconds to return to the table for another attempt, even if you keep your existing decks, and this pacing discourages the necessary repetition of levels.This is a game about trial and error: it’s difficult at times to know exactly what you are expected to do. When you approach a card for the first time, the way to win its token is not always apparent; if you’re unsuccessful, you have to put the card back in the deck for the next journey, or else forfeit and lose your current progress so you can try again. This aligns with the punishing nature of the game, but it’s frustrating when coupled with the sheer time it takes to repeat a level.Despite a few issues with pacing, Hand of Fate 2 crafts an atmosphere based on its predecessor, but also full of surprises. You will want to spend hours playing games within games within this game, even as the Dealer taunts you for your missteps.",

Just download torrent and start playing it.Hand of Fate Download Free Full Game is an action role-playing video game developed and published by Defiant Development for Linux, Microsoft Windows, OS X, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A PlayStation Vita version was announced but ultimately cancelled due to development issues.GameplayHand of Fate is an action role-playing video game with roguelike and deck-building elements. The player takes the role of a nameless hero that meets a strange Dealer in a «cabin at the end of the world». This dealer narrates the player's adventure, dealing the game's cards, rewards, penalties, lore, and commentary. He also serves as the primary antagonist for the game.On starting a new game, the player is given a starting deck of cards, consisting of equipment, hero class, and encounter cards. The player earns more cards as they progress in the game, which they can use to customize their deck up to a fixed size. Furthermore, the dealer has his own deck from which surprising elements such as more challenging encounters and monsters are drawn that also grows as the player gains cards and progresses through the game. Hand of Fate Free Download.In the game's Story Mode, the player must defeat thirteen bosses: twelve court cards and the Dealer himself. These bosses, representing the royalty of each suit, must be defeated in order, but the player can return to previous bosses to challenge again and unlock new rewards. After a certain number of these bosses are defeated, the player also unlocks Endless Mode, which provides an infinite number of «floors» of increasing difficulty for the player to challenge with every card they have collected up to that point.To progress in Story Mode, the player must complete a «dungeon» by exploring two or more «floors» created by a tableau of randomized, face-down encounter cards dealt from the combined deck of both player and Dealer. In addition to random encounters, each floor also includes either an exit encounter that lets the player reach the next floor, or a boss encounter on the final floor of that dungeon. The player starts with a limited amount of health, food, and initial equipment, modified by the player's selected class card and certain conditions obtained over the course of the story. To navigate each floor of the dungeon, the player moves a token across the tableau one card at a time, revealing it if face down. When each card is encountered, the Dealer narrates the event and resolves its effects.Events can include meeting non-player characters, shops to buy and sell cards that benefit the player for the remainder of that dungeon, enemy encounters, or chance events that may benefit or hinder the player. Some of these events include a tree of options that the player can choose, while chance is presented as four shuffled cards representing rates of success or failure. Each movement step consumes food, and certain events can cause the player to gain or lose health, food, gold, blessings, curses, or equipment. The latter three can augment the player's attack power, defensive power, health, speed, or provide special abilities or conditions both inside and out of combat. Hand of Fate Free Download PC Game.If the player encounters a monster or maze of traps, the number and type of enemy are determined by cards drawn by the Dealer (if any). The game then enters a third-person perspective action mode, where the player can attack, dodge, reflect and counterattack enemies and traps represented by the cards that were drawn. Damage taken is reflected in the player's overall health, which can be recovered normally with food or at certain shops and healers. On completing some encounters, the Dealer will present special tokens representing new cards that the player will receive at the conclusion of that dungeon, regardless of whether they won or were defeated.If the player's character loses all of their health (i.e., by encounter or starvation) or chooses to forfeit from the in-game menu, they lose that dungeon, and the board is reset after they receive their tokens. If the player successfully beats the dungeon's boss, they progress one step forward in the story. The Dealer awaits the player for the final showdown and confrontation, so the player must pay close attention to deck-building, strategy, tactics, and chance in order to succeed.DevelopmentHand of Fate was first shown at the 2013 Game Developers Conference. A playable demo build was shown to the public at PAX Australia in July 2013. By this point, the game had been in development for under six months. Defiant Development are a team of approximately fifteen based in Brisbane, they described Hand of Fate as their «first big push» onto PC platforms following their previous mobile projects. Like all other Defiant games, Hand of Fate is built in Unity. Hand of Fate for PC.The game was part funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign. It was one of the first Australian projects to launch on Kickstarter. The campaign launched in November 2013 and concluded in December 2013, achieving its A$50,000 target. Not only was the campaign a financial success, it also allowed Defiant to build an audience and get feedback on pre-release builds. A Greenlight campaign was launched simultaneously so that the game could be released on Steam, and the game was approved in January 2014.A week following the crowdfunding campaign, an alpha build was released for Kickstarter backers. A beta version followed in February 2014, and in July, the game launched for Windows, OS X, and Linux on Steam Early Access. The full version was released for Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 17 February 2015.A sequel, Hand of Fate 2, has been announced with a planned early 2017 release. The sequel will add more challenges that the player must meet to proceed in dungeons, stronger monsters to face in battle, and companions that can be gained during the adventure which assist the player in combat.ReceptionHand of Fate received positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Microsoft Windows version 81.58% based on 13 reviews and 78/100 based on 27 reviews, the Xbox One version 79.75% based on 12 reviews and 80/100 based on 11 reviews and the PlayStation 4 version 79.28% based on 18 reviews and 79/100 based on 15 reviews.The game sold about 400,000 copies across personal computers and consoles, and it was downloaded more than 1.5 million times as part of a free game promotion for Xbox Live.

      "A Unity ID allows you to buy and/or subscribe to Unity products and services, shop in the Asset Store and participate in the Unity community.LanguagePublished: January 5. 2015Read more about Hand of Fate and Defiant Development“We have an avid bunch of board gamers here at the office, and we especially like card games,” says Defiant developer Liam Hill. “Lots of them are played during our lunch breaks.” The studio’s upcoming Hand of Fate began with the idea that they could take the architecture and randomness of roguelike games, and afford the player more control over the challenges they would face, along with the rewards they would receive. “The card games that we play in the office are filled with ‘Random Event’ decks and ‘Treasure’ piles, and out of these two concepts sprung Hand of Fate,” says Hill.There are currently ten full-timers at Defiant, along with between one to three contractors at any given time. Most of the team members have worked together on previous projects, and have even worked at different studios together prior to Defiant.The team has used Unity since starting Defiant four years ago, having shipped a number of different projects on it for various platforms (including mobile hits Ski Safari and Heroes Call). “When we initially decided to use Unity for development, we were coming from our previous experience with custom engines that required a lot of work to get the best out of,” says Defiant’s Dan Treble. “Unity lets us punch above our weight, and allows us to ship Hand of Fate on multiple SKU's—including both next gen consoles—with relative ease, and with a much smaller team than we used to have in the AAA days.”The studio’s Morgan Jaffit tells us that the team is big believers in building and testing, and as such had a demo up very early on. In fact, he says, it was much easier to get a prototype up than it's been to finish the game. “We first showed the game to the public at GDC after a couple of months of prototype development, and even then it was clear we were on to something,” he says. Since then, he says various features have become invaluable, including blend shape support added in Unity 4.3, “without which we couldn't have brought the dealer to life.” He also notes that Marmoset Skyshop has added huge amount to the look of the game.According to Jaffit, much of the game is very similar to that original demo. “You can go back to some of our earliest videos—like our Kickstarter trailer from last year—and see the same concepts and core ideas in place,” he says.  Different elements of the game have evolved as time has passed, certainly, and deck-building has become significantly more important to the experience. “Ultimately, though, we had a clear vision at the start, and around that vision the game has grown into its own thing as we went. A lot of the details were missing, and we've gone through and filled those out along the way.”Treble says that generally speaking, the team goes to great lengths to keep everything as simple as humanly possible. “We keep all of our assets’ text, and try and split them up to avoid multiple people editing the same files,” he says. “Static batching is currently saving our frame rate.” They’ve also built a handful of tools within the editor, to help the designers create encounters, sequence animations in time to voice over, and to profile the scenes for memory and performance. “We’re producing builds monthly at the moment; we branch them a week before they’re due, and switch into bug fixing mode.”Jaffit remembers a moment at PAX Australia 2013, where Jerry Holkins from Penny Arcade played the game and pegged it as a “deck-building roguelike”. “This was a key moment, as we’d been struggling to get a succinct summation ourselves for weeks,” he says.Indeed, the years have taught the developers at Defiant a great deal about process. “We’ve learned to work in smaller, iterative cycles—approximately two weeks apiece—to keep track of progress,” says Kim Allom. “Short cycles work for small teams because it allows for more efficient resource use, due to frequent and regular checks on current project progress.” Allom says that when the team can spot an oversight or tweak a feature early in its development, it saves valuable time on backtracking. “It helps us [avoid] time spent on devising plans on how the tweak may effect other systems that the feature may link to, because it was further along in development.”With a haul of $54,000, Kickstarter certainly played a role in getting Hand of Fate off the ground—but it didn’t get them all the way. “The game has gone much longer than we anticipated, so we've definitely ended up spending more than the Kickstarter funds,” says Jaffit. “That said, the Kickstarter was really about finding our audience early.” He points out that Hand of Fate is a niche game, in that it appeals to fans of card games and deck-building who also enjoy an action component. “We wanted to make the best game possible for that niche, and Kickstarter helped us to find people who were enthusiastic and make them part of the development process. That's been worth much more than the funding.”“I'm incredibly proud that we've delivered something unique,” says Jaffit of the game that Hand of Fate has become. “There are no other games that do what Hand of Fate does, and we've given a sense of atmosphere and place that's incredibly strong. Everyone on the team has helped make that happen, and I think it comes across when you play.”Defiant recently announced that Hand of Fate will be coming to Xbox One, which means that the team has covered most of the available home platforms, including PC, Mac, Linux and PlayStation 4. “The team is currently going through technical requirements, and we’re excited by the idea of the public playing our game on console,” says Allom. The studio plans to release Hand of Fate in January 2015.Self-avowed “big fans” of the Unity Asset Store, the team at Defiant Development has been able to work smarter and faster because of it. Here’s a list of the many tools they’ve employed in creating Hand of Fate:\n•   Amplify Color \n•   BIG Environment Pack \n•   cInput Pro \n•   Hand Painted Texture Pack - Natural Surfaces \n•   Hand Painted Textures - Ground Pack 1 \n•   InControl \n•   Medieval Environment Pack \n•   NGUI: Next-Gen UI \n•   Pre-Integrated Skin Shader \n•   ProFlares \n•   Sage: Anim Graph Editor \n•   Skyshop: Image-Based Lighting Tools & Shaders \n•   Texture Pack 02 \n•   Top-Down Assets MobileHand of Fate visual style comes from the mind of Shawn Eustace, art director at Defiant Development. “He’s steered the games vision from the beginning,” says Morgan Jaffit, pointing to the difficulty of driving both a realistic high fantasy in-game style, alongside the illustrative, wood-cut style for the game’s cards. “Working back and forth between these two disparate parts of the experience and making them feel like they belong to the same world was extremely important, and Shawn's managed to harness the skills of our seven person art team incredibly well,” says Jaffit.PurchaseEducationDownloadUnity LabsResourcesAbout UnityGet Unity newsTo start receiving news from Unity Technologies, click on the link we've sent to your e-mail account.Something went wrong, please try again.LanguagePartnersWe use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.

    "title": "Captain Forever Remix",
    "text": [
      "Captain Forever is a series of space shooter games by Australian developer Jarred \"Farbs\" Woods. Its name stems from both its development process, with new versions of the game being continuously developed and released and its endless gameplay. There are four games in the series, the first of which is free and paying supporters may gain access to any future sequels released without being required to make any extra payments. In May 2018, the first three games in the series, namely Captain Forever, Captain Successor, and Captain Impostor, were re-built and bundled as Captain Forever Trilogy on Steam. All current Supporters are to be granted Steam Keys to redeem the Trilogy, and as of May 2018 the Supporter program stopped accepting new members.A standalone \"remix\", Captain Forever Remix, was created by Pixelsaurus Games who worked in conjunction with Woods to bring the title to modern systems. Remix was released to Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux in March 2015.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nCaptain Forever was inspired by the 2007 freeware game Battleships Forever, which itself drew inspiration from the 2003 game Warning Forever.\nIn each game in the Captain Forever series, with the exception of Captain Impostor, the player pilots a ship with the ability to be expanded by attaching 'modules' (such as lasers or boosters) gained from defeated enemies to a command module, represented by a box containing a broken heart. The goal in the game is to keep your ship alive for as long as possible. As the game progresses, stronger enemy ships (labeled according to letters from the NATO phonetic alphabet) arrive. Destroying stronger ships increases the Law (levels within the game), until Protectors (Peacekeepers in the original game) arrive to attack. The game effectively ends after the first Protector is destroyed (replacing the command module's broken heart with a complete one) but the player may continue accumulating parts indefinitely. If the player's ship is destroyed, it explodes, destroying all ships in the immediate area and clearing the area for the player to begin rebuilding their ship from scratch. The default background is a grid of green lines over a black background with a faint image of a pilot's face in the middle. The background can be changed, however, to an image taken by the player's webcam.\n\n\n== Sequels ==\nCaptain Successor: Launched for supporters in November 2009, as the original game was made freely available to all players.  This new game introduces a variety of new weapons, propulsion and defensive modules, as well as more types of enemy ships.Captain Impostor: Released in March 2010, but is only available to paying supporters. It introduced the Clone Drive which copies enemy designs entirely and cannot be constructed module by module.Captain Jameson: A project that was intended to become a full-fledged RPG, it got scrapped in early 2013, but is still playable by Captain Forever supporters. The modern version of this is The Dawn Star.\nThe Dawn Star: Originally labeled \"Captain Jameson Reboot\", is a revision of the previous iteration. A commonly agreed origin of the name comes from a member page on the game's forums. The purpose is to further expand the game and to improve game mechanics and aesthetics.\nCaptain Forever Trilogy: The bundle was released in May 2018 and consists of Forever, Successor, and Impostor. All three games were rebuilt and available on Steam. Additional module types were added to the game, such as angled shield modules and graphics were updated.\n\n\n== Reception and awards ==\nCaptain Forever won the Best Game award at China's first Independent Games Festival in 2009.Captain Forever was also named as one of the 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.\n\n\n== Captain Forever Remix ==\n\n\n=== Gameplay ===\n\nAt its core, the Remix version is similar to the main Captain Forever games. The player controls a spacecraft which they can build from various modules, fighting against other spacecraft and using modules knocked off from those to expand their own. The Remix version adds a more direct goal - completing 10 stages as the player races to the end of the solar system, facing strong enemies in each turn. The game is structured as a roguelike, as the encounters at each stage are procedurally-generated, and should the player's core unit be destroyed, they must start the game from the start. Each stage is completed by meeting a specific goal, such as destroying a ship of a given level (as assigned by the game). A larger meta-game, based on progress during a given playthrough, unlocks new \"starter kits\" for the initial ship, such as ships geared for long-range attacks, or for close-range overpowered attacks. The starter kits can be upgraded as well in the meta-game, providing better modules within the kit at the start.The game is framed around Natalie Norberry, a schoolgirl that imagines herself as a cartoon character, Captain Forever, fighting to race to the edge of the solar system against enemies set at her by her younger brother.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nCaptain Forever Remix was a project born out by Pixelsaurus Games, made up of Dean Tate and Brian Chan, who had met while working at Harmonix before moving on to other studios. Both had tired of the larger studio environments and opted to work together on an independently-developed title. While brainstorming ideas, they recalled fond memories of playing Captain Forever and started to work a pitch to approach Woods with.They initially pitched the idea of Captain Forever HD, providing updated graphics and support for modern systems. Woods countered the idea, suggesting that they completely remix the game to keep the core gameplay but give it something new so that Tate and Chan's talents could be shown off. Encouraged, the two developed the Remix version under the idea of Saturday-morning cartoons to provide the childlike setting for the game. This direction allowed them to set the visual style for the game - where the backgrounds are inspired by a messy child's room - and to envision new module types they could include in the game. Woods was not directly involved in development but was kept apprised of the state of the game, and has seen ideas presented by Tate and Chan that he anticipates including into his own titles. Remix was developed in the Unity engine, which Woods noted took Tate and Chan time to recreate the core game play from the original Flash-based engine.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nWhat is Captain Forever?, an article explaining and praising the Captain Forever series",

      "By\nChris Schilling\n2016-06-22T00:29:04.173ZReviewA warmly affectionate remake of a browser classic, with enough new pieces to justify its existence.You’re never more vulnerable in Captain Forever Remix than when you’ve just destroyed an enemy craft. You might think it’s the moment when you’re facing an opponent three times your size with six times as many guns. Not so. Carefully approaching one such vessel from its left flank, I managed to chip away at its defences, dancing nimbly around its laser blasts until it was a much fairer fight. At least until it caught on to my plan and took out my outermost bulkheads, leaving me with just a single booster. I pinwheeled around madly, firing desperately in the hope that a bolt or two might just hit its now exposed core. Incredibly, they did. Boom.As the fragments scattered, I began to scoop them up and attach them to my tiny command module. But our battle had created enough noise to attract a gigantic blue monstrosity, which silently entered the fray from above as I was distracted by rebuilding. Two or three direct hits were enough to permanently curtail my careless scavenging. I could almost hear Liam Neeson over my shoulder, stroking his beard and musing quietly “there’s always a bigger ship”.Like the celebrated browser game upon which this is based, Captain Forever Remix casts you as both space pilot and space pirate: you target a ship, fire a broadside into its hull until it explodes and claim its booty. But your treasure here is another man’s trash: you loot parts not coins, turning engineer as you bolt the most useful bits to your own craft and let the rest of the detritus float off into the unforgiving void. That’s the idea, anyway; quite often you’ll end up destroying the guns or shields you wanted most to get to the command module, your enemy’s last line of defence. Lose your own module, of course, and it’s game over.At the heart of Captain Forever is a fascinating tension. You need to keep your soft core protected, but you don’t want to make your ship too unwieldy. Quick and manoeuvrable seems like a sensible choice, but if you’ve got more boosters than guns you risk leaving yourself underpowered in a firefight. And while heat-seeking missiles might seem like a smart addition, are they going to give you the precision you need to target an opponent’s weak point without demolishing its most valuable assets? It’s a game where you have to make on-the-fly choices almost every minute you’re out there. Can I afford the extra bulk of these healing modules, or should I nab an extra booster? And you thought Telltale had the monopoly on tough decisionsAll of this was true of the original, but Pixelsaurus Games has built upon that elegant design in a host of smart ways. The most obvious difference is the addition of a story mode of sorts: you progress through the galaxy across ten levels, moving onto the next planet once you’ve beaten a higher-level rival, with a minute to sift through the remains and take what you need before the warp. Beat the fifth level and you’ll unlock another selection of parts to use from the off, this time with a focus on sniping. As you’d imagine, this makes for a nervy change of pace, as you zoom the camera as far out as it will go, and edge your way towards another ship’s signature, knowing they’re every bit as well-equipped as you to take a ship down from distance. Unlock the melee set, meanwhile, and you’ll engage in messy, close-quarters skirmishes. Brandishing buzzsaws to tactically dismember opponents? Why, it’s like a top-down Dead Space.While the presentation lacks the sparse beauty of the original’s irresistible combo of crisp neon geometry and stark blackness, it compensates in exuberant character. It’s possibly the first Nickelodeon-inspired roguelike, populated by a cast of misfits and oddballs that make Ren and Stimpy look comparatively normal. Expect a light dusting of narrative rather than a deep, twisted lore: all you need to know is that the action is prompted by a girl imagining her brother has become an omnipotent pink mutant, and she assumes her alter ego Captain Forever to take him down.Alas, in my hands, she was more Captain Ten Minutes. This is a savagely tough game on the default difficulty, seemingly a response to complaints during Early Access that it was too easy. Opponents are deft and aggressive, and occasionally comically overstuffed with ordnance. Perhaps I’m just a terrible engineer, or just not quick or clever enough to be able to improvise in a pinch, but once you’ve lost a piece or two, recoveries are difficult against foes this relentless, and retreats aren’t easy when thrusting forwards launches you into an ungainly spin. After a while I retreated to the relative safety of the sandbox mode, where your last 5,000 ship designs are stored, so if you have a build you’re particularly fond of, you can recall it and start again with a little more firepower. Here you can call upon Steam Workshop designs shared by other players; the thrill of commanding something grotesquely overpowered proved a blissful release after my struggles in the campaign.If it’s best played in short bursts, Captain Forever Remix is the kind of game I can see myself returning to regularly, tinkering with elaborate designs before watching them get blasted into space dust. After all, while Galak-Z remains my galactic go-to for thrilling dogfights, it doesn’t let me build a ship out of space Lego.What is it?

      "The founder of up-and-coming review aggregator OpenCritic has accused rivals Metacritic of using the site’s data without permission.I wonder what scores our list of upcoming PC games will average out at.In a press release sent out today, founderMatthew Enthoven said, “We didn’t know if we should be proud or outraged when we took a look at Metacritic this morning and saw that they had OpenCritic’s review data and information on their site.“On the positive side, we were excited to see another industry giant stand alongside companies such as Insomniac Games, Nvidia and Telltale in presenting OpenCritic as an authority. However, we’re frustrated that we did not receive recognition and have requested that they either credit OpenCritic or begin licensing our API and databases.”Basically, OpenCritic seem to have found a way to more efficiently grab the review data to fill up the site once an embargo lifts. According to Enthoven, Metacritic are just swiping at least some of this data from them, rather than sourcing it from the outlets themselves, without crediting them.“If you can’t see how they copied us, we wouldn’t blame you – we make subtle, near-invisible changes to various review data to tag it using a system we call ‘horsemen’, Enthoven explained. “For example, with PCGamer’s Blood and Wine review, we added a redundant slash after pcgamer.com. With Twinfinite’s review, we capitalized the “W” and “B” in the review URL.“We can’t detail every example as it would give away our tells, but these two are notable: Metacritic’s Blood and Wine page currently has these exact horsemen listed, leading us to believe that they’ve begun sourcing reviews from OpenCritic. These changes don’t interfere with the user experience and are unique to OpenCritic. We checked to make sure that these links did not appear on popular websites such as Neogaf and reddit. We also feel confident in claiming that we listed these URLs first. As with most games, OpenCritic was faster: in this case, three hours faster.”The ‘horsemen’ were built into the system to protect the site’s work, in the same way old cartographers would add fake place to maps and phone books would leave in fake numbers – it’s like a fingerprint for their work, basically.I really like OpenCritic’s setup, as it doesn’t alter scores because they’re not on the /10 scale and it actually credits the critics, going as far as having a page for each one. Mine even has my face on it, it’s great.As Enthoven puts it: “We’re the only aggregator that correctly credits authors in addition to publications. We’re the only aggregator that lets users pick-and-choose their trusted publications. And unlike Metacritic, all of our scores are presented as simple averages with no hidden weightings, using data that can be verified by the public.“As we announced last January, our API alpha is in full swing and will soon shift into beta. We hope that Metacritic and others will consider joining our beta and licensing our API.”I emailed Enthoven to see what the company plans to do about the current situation, to which he responded: “We don’t intend to proceed beyond this statement and the letter that we’ve sent to [Metacritic owners] CBS Interactive. The legal precedents are not in our favor, nor would we want to engage in any legal proceedings. We can think of no faster way to drain funds and lose momentum.“Our intent here was to send a strong message to Metacritic that we are a serious competitor and that we will continue to call them out on practices that don’t advance the industry overall, including sourcing from us without credit.”ShareClicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.PromotedHow to master Monster Hunter: World’s deep combat system7 reasons you should return to RuneScape and Old School RuneScapeWhy a visit to Monster Hunter: World should be your videogame summer vacation",

      "(User scores are recalculated daily)Captain Forever Remix recreates the original Captain Forever title with enhanced gameplay. Your objective is to design the most powerful spaceship you can from randomly generated parts from the ships that you destroy in the rougelike framework.Each individual game in Captain Forever Remix starts off the same with players building a starting spaceship from a handful of parts. These parts include the likes of missile cannons, engines, bulkheads and other modules that provide unique benefits. As players play more and more games the beginning pieces available will change which provides the underlying progression given the rougelike nature of the game where ship destruction ends your particular run.With your starting ship designed using the simple drag and drop interface players step into the procedurally generated level where you’ll encounter other ships. Your goal in each level is to destroy a particular level ship and is best achieved by exploring the surrounding area first to take out smaller ships and with luck find chests. Once your goal is achieved you’ll transport to the next level which features higher grade ships and potentially traps such as space mines which complicate matters further.By destroying these weaker opponents command module or locating chests you’ll get new modules to attach to your ship which you can opt to take or leave behind. In doing so players will slowly improve their strength either through greater movement capabilities, more damage or unique skills such as life steal. Players are not limited to changing their ship design after enemies are defeated either and can be done at any time, even in combat which creates some interesting on the fly decisions.For example players might find themselves surrounded by enemies in a ship with poor manoeuvrability and move their weapons to all sides of their ship to counter all opponents at once. While Captain Forever Remix does not feature a mini map players receive pings (similar to ripples) that indicate the locations of ships.It’s fast, fun, simple and always different which makes Captain Forever Remix a potent roguelike space title.Summary:Quick Links:Videos:Games Finder aims to provide the ultimate games like resource that allows gamers to easily find similar games based on their gaming history.About | Privacy Policy | Contact Us | Stores Like Finder |All names, brands and imagery used are trademarks and/or copyrighted materials of their respective owners.

      "Runestone Keeper is a roguelike video game developed and published by Blackfire Games, with the iOS version developed by Cimu. It was released on March 23, 2015 for Windows and Mac OS X, October 31, 2015 for iOS, and August 11, 2017 for Android.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game is a roguelike that has been compared to Dungelot for the fact that the player explores levels by tapping on dark tiles to reveal them, but also adds \"extensive RPG elements\". The player can choose from six different classes and explores the level for keys as well as items. Each level has 56 tiles and the player can only move to the next level down by finding the stairs.To attack enemies, the player taps on the tile they are on, but each monster also has unique skills, like deflecting or absorbing damage. Enemies will usually counterattack only when attacked, unless they are ranged, while other enemies gradually get stronger if they are left alone. Wiping out all monsters on the floor gives the player an additional bonus.The player's own stats can be buffed by equipment, and items can give the player temporary advantages. Using items costs \"Soul\" points, making them only able to be used at specific times. The player can also sacrifice various things at altars to pledge themselves to a god and obtain a stat boost.When the player dies, they will bring back all of their money to their home base, allowing them to upgrade the base, buy characters or increase the power of abilities.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game takes place in a town above a mysterious dungeon known as the Runestone Dungeon that is said to contain great power. Many different warriors come to descend into the depths of the dungeon, but they are all trapped forever within it. Each time the player defeats the final boss, the game's universe \"resets\", unbeknownst to the player character, although other NPCs are aware of this. Each run of the game ends with the final stanza of The Hollow Men.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAlexandru Chirila of Softpedia scored the game's demo 4/5 stars, calling it \"a wonderful little dungeon crawler\" and \"a well-polished game even though it's still in the works\". Carter Dodson of TouchArcade called the game \"a solid game to check out\" and said that he \"had fun with it\". 4Gamer.net also recommended the game to players who were interested in roguelikes.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "Runestone Keeper is a rogue-like game. Each time a new game is started, the dungeon levels are generated; monsters, devices, exits, etc are placed randomly. The player has to start over if the character dies. The game will allow you to \"Save and Quit,\" but death is permanent (no loading from an old save point).Unlike other games, the character's avatar does not show up on the dungeon. Gameplay is slightly similar to Minesweeper, in that only the cell the player clicks interacts with the character (with few exceptions). If the player clicks the monster, it attacks back. If the player uncover a trap, they take damage from that trap, and so on. Most monsters and devices do nothing if they are not interacted with.As a rogue-like, the placement of items, traps, monsters and shops is random. Therefore, there is no build and strategy that is guaranteed to work everytime, and player are encouraged to adapt their strategy to progress further.The game shows the dungeon floor on the left, and the character statistics on the right.Kill monsters awards the character with experience points (XP). After a specific amount of xp is collected, the character reaches a new level. The character's life point and mana point is refilled, and the player can choose to upgrade one of the 4 base attributes by 1 point. The level cap in basic mode is 10.The basic attributes are:OffensiveDefensiveOthersArmor works like extra Life Points. Physical attacks (both melee and ranged) depletes Armor before reducing Life points. Traps that inflict physical damage (like Spike Traps) also deplete armor first.At the beginning of a dungeon level, the character's armor is refilled. The amount of armor depend on the character's equipment. Every hero starts with a Padded armor which gives 10 armor points. To increase armor points, the player can wear items that give bonus to armor. Worshipping the God of Rock gives you 10 extra armor points. If the player find an Anvil, it can be used to completely refill the armor points for free. Armor can also be temporarily increased by using skills.Strategy: Armor points are set based on equipment worn when you first enter the dungeon level. It is recommended that the player put on the equipment that provide the most bonus to armor before descending into the next level, to maximize the amount of armor points gained. After that, the player can swap them out for equipment that provides other bonuses.Resistance reduce elemental damage by a flat percentage. For example, if the character has 10% Resistance get hit by a monster with 10 Elemental damage, they will take 9 damage.To attack a monster, the player clicks on the monster portrait. The basic battle round works like this:For monster with melee attacks, they will only attack when the player clicks on them. Monsters with ranged attack, on the other hand, will attack every turn.The battle rounds will be changed based on various factorThe purple bar measures your soul points. Using items and devices on the dungeon consumes soul points. You collect 1 soul point on clicking on a mist-tile. There are several items that allows you to reveal more than one mist-tile per click, but you still get only one soul point per click on mist-tiles.Goddess of Benevolence and the God of Treasure benefits greatly the player upon collecting soul points.Soul bar capacity is 60 soul points by default. Every dungeon level has 56 tiles, meaning up to 55 soul points can be collected per level.Maximum number of souls can be increased from 60 by activating a tomb tile (50% chance of increasing by 2, and 50% chance instead of decreasing maximum hit points by 2).",

      "developed by Blackfire GamesRunestone Keeper is a turn-based dungeon crawler roguelike with lite rpg components.  There have been a plethora of Roguelike and Rogue-lite games released over the past few years.  The question is, does Runestone Keeper offer enough to warrant a purchase?  After playing dozens of commercially released and freeware indie roguelikes during this recent resurgence, I think I can safely say that Runestone Keeper is worth your time and money, depending on what you’re looking for though.  If you enjoy dungeon crawling with a somewhat plain appearance and straightforward combat, and the term “casual gameplay” doesn’t turn you off, then you’ll find a lot to like about Runestone Keeper.  There isn’t much of a story, but what Runestone Keeper lacks in story, it more than makes up for in gameplay.The gameplay reminds me a little bit of Desktop Dungeons without the puzzle elements and with a hint of tabletop board game.  In fact, it almost feels like a cross between a Rogelike meets Minesweeper.  That doesn’t mean that there’s no depth to the gameplay though.  It’s a more straight forward affair than something like Nethack or Mines of Moria, but Runestone Keeper does offer some great replay value with it’s randomly generated dungeons, diversity in monsters, an interesting combat system, simple but addictive qualities including an interesting mixture of exploration and loot discovery.  It’s all very easy to get into with an uncomplicated user interface that requires nothing more than simple pointing and clicking (no need for memorizing hotkeys or quick reference guides).As simple as this all sounds, the challenge and difficulty level fall right into the roguelike catagory.  You’re still going to die a lot, and just when you think you’ve started to get the hang of things, the game will throw a series of new traps or monsters at you that can’t be dealt with at your current level.  Thankfully, in some cases, there’s the option to avoid combat.  The first thing you’ll need to do though is explore.  You’ll need to search each dungeon floor if you plan on making it deeper into the dungeon because most levels are blocked by a locked door that requires a key to open, and most keys are guarded by monsters.  The only way to aquire these keys is by defeating certain monsters.  Unfortunately, you never know which monster is actually carrying the key.By clicking away at the grid based / tile based levels, you’ll uncover areas of the dungeon the were previously unrevealed.  Every time you click you’re taking a risk because you never know when you’re going to stumble upon a monster or a trap.  Along the way though, you’ll find scrolls that provide useful tips for dungeon exploration and monster extermination.  You’ll also encounter friendly denizens that are more than willing to help you out by providing useful items, if you have the coin to pay for their products.  Randomly discovered weapons and items are also quite useful as they can contribute to your strengh, mana, spellpower, or perhaps give passive abilities that allow the player to discover areas of the dungeon without fear of setting off traps.As mentioned earlier, you’re going to die a lot.  This isn’t such a bad thing since you’ll sometimes be able to relocate the remains of your previous adventurer which will increase your health and enhance certain attributes.  Completing goals and exploring deeper and deeper into the dungeon will also grant you extra coin when you die.  This becomes useful because it allows the player to do things such as unlocking an upgrade or item shop back at the world hub / dungeon entrance.  With repeated gameplay, you can greatly increase the strength of your adventurer.  As a bonus, you’ll also unlock new characters that offer unique skillsets or bonuses which will enhance and alter the way the game can be played.The graphics and sound, both music and effects, are simple.  They aren’t exactly impressive, but they certainly do get the job done.  It’s hard trying to avoid the word simple when describing Runestone Keeper, but I also find it difficult to express just how much depth and high replay value is contained within.  You could easily mistake the casual style for a game that was easy, but don’t let its looks fool you.  It is challenging but fun, and anyone who enjoys roguelikes or rpg’s will find something enjoyable and entertaining.  Runestone Keeper also allows gamers to compete with other gamers by attempting to reach the top of the leaderboards.  I found this a little difficult however considering how insanely high some of the scores are.  Still, it gives the more tenacious gamers something to strive for, while the more casual gamers will be happy to loot dead monsters and unlock some of the interesting achievements.  Speaking of which, there are over 60 achievements and some of them will require extensive play to obtain.The game has it’s own charm, and I found the play mechanics addictive enough to keep me coming back for more.  I’ve tried emphasizing how the game looks and feels like a casual experience, but there is a certain amount of depth and breadth to it that gives it a board game feel.  This is the type of roguelike that can be played in short bursts or brief periods of time, but you could also find yourself playing for hours and being consumed by the addictive nature of its gameplay.  It doesn’t really do anything new or exciting and that we haven’t seen before, but It’s also not like your typical roguelike or RPG that you’ll find on PC.  As long as you keep that in mind and approach it with reasonable expectations, Runestone Keeper is the type of game that can keep you coming back to it’s dungeons quite often.Runestone Keeper is available for both PC and Mac and can be bought on Steam or purchased through the Humble Store for the low price of $9.99 US.[yasr_multiset setid=0]Comments are closed.",

There are a few problems with translation but nothing new if you're familiar with chinese to english translations. \n\nAs far as the weird access permission popping up at game launch it's the same one a lot of games require except you accept by installing the game by default. This leads me to believe that the developers aren't that familiar with xbox in general and I'd guess any patches are unlikely.One person found this helpful.4/29/2018SeltharinRating:1/5As has been stated, the game requires permissions. I have never been a believer in allowing software developers to have that kind of access to my information. I decided to overlook this seeing as how the cash was already spent, and installed it. After hours of grinding, the game bugged out, causing the loss of all saved info. From this point forward, every restart of the software was clean as if no gameplay had occurred. \n\nFinal verdict: Invasive and unplayable.

Cross-save allows you to pick the game where you left off no matter where you are.Runestone Keeper is a roguelike puzzle adventure with role-playing elements. It's set within a dark fantasy world filled with challenges. Following a great cataclysm, the surviving population discovers a mysterious sealed dungeon. The dungeon is said to contain untold magical runestones and treasure, but none who enter it ever step out again. Playing as one of several unlockable heroes, you'll become the sealed dungeon's conqueror, next victim, depending on how you play.The gameplay in Runestone Keeper is quite different from other such titles. For example, just Minesweeper, each floor of the dungeon begins as a grid of mist-covered tiles. Selecting a tile reveals its contents, which can include helpful items like gold, keys and runes. If you uncover just enough tiles, you'll discover the exit to the next floor. There are also story events with varying choices mixed in.Surviving enough floors to escape the sealed dungeon won't be easy though. Players encounter numerous forms of damage, traps, and hordes of increasingly deadly monsters. Runestone Keeper features a turn-based battle system in which players simply attack, use items, or activate spells or skills. Defeating monsters rewards the hero with the experience and gold. Both of these can used to become stronger and buy better gear.Keep in mind that each floor is randomized and death is permanent. Luckily, the game allows you to maintain gold between runs and unlock permanent upgrades.Runestone Keeper is only available as a digital download for $9.99 on Xbox One and Windows 10. Keep in mind that it's listed as \"符石守护者\" on the Microsoft Store instead of its English translation.See at Microsoft StoreKeep an eye on WindowsCentral.com/Gaming for all the latest in Xbox and Windows 10 gaming, accessories, news, and reviews!",

      "Skyshine's Bedlam is a turn-based tactical roguelike and simulation game developed by Skyshine Games and published by Versus Evil. It was released on September 16, 2015 for Windows and Mac OS X.\nIt received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art and music, but criticized its story and high level of difficulty.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe player is the overseer of a massive wheeled fortress known as the Dozer, and must cross a post-apocalyptic wasteland safely. The player can choose a route on a minimap, which determines what types of encounters they have. The player can also upgrade the Dozer in order to make traversal of the wasteland easier.Fights take place on an isometric grid. Squad members come in four classes, each with their own specialties. Soldiers cannot be replaced when they die, and it is almost inevitable that casualties will occur.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe player must navigate the Dozer from Bysantine, a futuristic metropolis, to Aztec City, a distant utopia. Many factions control parts of the wasteland in between, such as Cyborgs, Mutants, Marauders, or A.I. Each trip is procedurally generated, and events occur differently in each playthrough.\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe setting of the game was formerly a tabletop RPG, and was based on 80's science fiction and Dungeons & Dragons. The developers were also inspired by the fast pace of games like FTL and XCOM.The game uses the engine of The Banner Saga. It was originally known as simply Bedlam, but changed its name to avoid conflict with the game Bedlam released shortly beforehand, despite having already filed a trademark for the name. It was developed after a successful Kickstarter campaign which raised $166,540.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game received mixed reviews, with an aggregate score of 67/100 on Metacritic.Ian Birnbaum of PC Gamer rated the game 72/100, calling it \"punishing\" and \"stressful\", and saying that the difficulty was too high for him to enjoy. He stated that the inability to recruit new squad members if your existing ones died was where the game \"crossed the line from enjoyably brutal to stressful frustration\". However, he praised the soundtrack, saying that it was his \"favorite [...] in any game since Bastion\", and called the art \"wonderful\".Mat Paget of Gamespot rated the game 60/100, saying that while he believed it would be the \"perfect game\" for him at first glance, it did not have \"much strategic depth\" or a reason to \"care about [the characters]\". He called the story \"devoid of interesting or layered tales\".Artur Cnotalski of Eurogamer Poland rated the game 40/100, saying that it was \"monotonous\", with the storyline \"devoid of any depth\".\n\n\n== References ==",
      "If you took my favorite things and threw them in a blender it would come out looking like Skyshine’s Bedlam. Its blend of Mad Max's aesthetic, turn-based strategy combat, and roguelike trappings made me think I’d found the perfect game for me. But just like love at first sight, once I got to know Bedlam a little better, I realized that looks can be deceiving.In Skyshine’s Bedlam, you helm a vehicle known as the Dozer. The minute story details change from playthrough to playthrough because of the procedurally-generated nature of the game, but the main goal is to flee your home of Bysantine and drive you and your passengers to the Aztec City--Bysantine is suffering under the tyranny of a crazed warlord, King Viscera (no, not the ex-WWE wrestler). Along the way, you're stopped by wanderers, hostile factions, and other events and people that prevent you from just making a bee-line to your destination.Combat is a turn-based affair where you fight groups of marauders, mutants, and cyborgs. Your entire party can perform two actions per turn, which can be used to either move around, or to attack an enemy; for example, if you move one character and attack with another, your team's turn is over. This is far too restrictive in practice, and you often feel like there are only two strategies: move your character out of harm's way, or kill one enemy and have one of your characters die because you couldn't get them to safety.Simple tactics, like using a shotgun to knockback enemies into range of another character's attack, feel rewarding, but those moments are fleeting. There's not much strategic depth, and other than move distance, attack range, and damage, there's little else that distinguishes one character class from another, and little else to toy with during combat. I ultimately felt lucky--not accomplished--when I was victorious.The comic book-like presentation is great, and there's some enjoyable animations to behold, especially during combat. Killing an enemy with certain weapons, such as puke or a shotgun, causes them to crumble into a pile of bones. Characters perform finishing move animations if you kill an enemy point blank, like kicking them in the balls and delivering an elbow drop. These are pretty satisfying to watch and make some of the shots look absolutely devastating.The Dozer plays a major role in the world-traversing part of the game. During these segments, you click on icons to move around a randomly-generated map at the cost of food and fuel; the icons on the map will deliver tidbits of story through text. Sometimes you end up in a fight, sometimes you find some resources, and sometimes nothing will happen. Unfortunately, the variety of text that appears on the map is low, as I found text repeating itself quite early on, which pulled me out of the story.In addition to providing transportation, the Dozer can be used to heal teammates, turn them invisible, and to attack enemies. These abilities don’t count as an action, but they require power cells--a rather limited resource. These attacks deliver a devastating blow to your enemies, but because of the high resource cost--due to the rarity of power cells--I rarely used the Dozer for anything but healing my group.In the context of the story, your passengers are precious cargo, which you can lose if you're unlucky, or play poorly. There are times when they're unhappy, scared, or in need of a breath of fresh air, but it doesn’t delve deeper than that and I really wish Bedlam would give me a good reason to care about them. You rarely get the feeling that you're harboring living, breathing humans. Though the game ends if you run out of passengers, they're oddly plentiful, to the point that it's a no-brainer to give some of them up in trade to refuel the Dozer. As long as you make it to Aztec City, you are rewarded with new soldiers, regardless of how well you treated your crew.Defeating all of the hostile factions--Marauders, Mutants, Cyborgs, and Rogue A.I.-- allows you to unlock new factions and their respective Dozers. Each faction has its own unique abilities and stats; Rogue A.I. can teleport, while the Cyborgs can go invisible, allowing them to avoid getting hit for a turn. The big problem is that it’s not clear how you defeat a faction; it requires luck and patience, as finding the events that lead to unlocking a Dozer is seemingly random.You occasionally run into Elites during your travels, which are significantly larger and stronger characters than the average wastelander. With a greater amount of health and strength, they're tough, but they will join your ranks if you can beat them. It feels like a special event when they appear, and I always make a beeline toward them when they show up, dreaming of my powerful new recruit. Favorites include a lizard-mutant that pukes an acid-like substance and a giant wildman with a triple-barrelled shotgun that shoots incendiary ammo.Normally, you organically find Elites during your journey, but in the new Challenge mode, you start with a random crew of Elites and stronger-than-average soldiers from the get-go. Here, your goal is reversed: you travel from Aztec City to Byzantine, though King Viscera and factions are still on high alert, now with increased health and strength. This puts you past the stage of leveling up your crew and puts you right into the middle of hard-hitting combat. This is initially thrilling, but it can also be frustratingly difficult; you often feel forced to focus all of your resources on boss characters, which often leaves you empty handed, and ill-prepared to face the rest of your opponents.Skyshine’s Bedlam has some good moments, but the story is devoid interesting or layered tales. The experience is largely defined by chasing simple goals while enduring repetitive dialogue and narrative beats along the way. Combat feels good enough, but there's not much to it, and little to strive for. Not being able to make meaningful, permanent progress is ultimately Skyshine's Bedlam's biggest flaw, and when something so crucial is missing, it’s hard to recommend. There is some fun to be had, but Skyshine's Bedlam ultimately mirrors the reality it depicts. You can survive hardships, but only if you struggle through them.We'll begin emailing you updates about %gameName%.Use your keyboard!",

      "Taking cues from Fallout, Fire Emblem and even The Oregon Trail, Skyshine Games’ Skyshine’s Bedlam has grand plans to revolutionize the post-apocalyptic wild west. This game may crib notes from some of the greatest games out there, but does it bring anything new to the table?Taking cues from Fallout, Fire Emblem and even The Oregon Trail, Skyshine Games’ Skyshine’s Bedlam has grand plans to revolutionize the post-apocalyptic wild west. This game may crib notes from some of the greatest games out there, but does it bring anything new to the table?Skyshine’s Bedlam is an interesting beast, in that it doesn’t fit just one genre. At its core, your mission is simple – get your crew through the war-torn lands of Bedlam to Aztec City. However, it is the way the game is set up that makes things unique.For one, your escapades in Skyshine’s Bedlam are very tactical. Playing as the humans, cyborgs, rogue AI, or mutants, resource management is oftentimes more time-consuming than the battles themselves. Taking a page from The Oregon Trail, balancing food, crude, and power is an absolute must if you want your passengers and crew to make it to the end. Tough decisions must be made between each stop, with one wrong choice leading to a brisk end to your travels. Failure does not come with checkpoints – a game over screen equates to starting over from scratch.This can lead to an absolutely brutal style of play, which could be a blessing or a curse depending on who you are. There is a noticeable difficulty curve in Skyshine’s Bedlam, one that encourages players to learn from previous failures and mistakes. Its repetitive nature can be draining for those looking for fresh content, but the perfectionists among us (or just fans of roguelikes) will find a lot to love here.When hostile threats cross your path, gameplay changes gears into a top-down, grid-based SRPG. Much like Fire Emblem, players can choose from a roster of different classes. Those wishing to go in guns-a-blazing can do so, as those who would rather snipe from a distance. However, death is permanent in the wastelands of Bedlam, meaning that the type of crew you want isn’t always available.While these skirmishes usually pit a set amount of soldiers (in the single digits) against a group of enemies, the amount of things that can happen in just two actions per turn can be downright staggering. A defensive style of play is definitely encouraged, as the odds are almost never in your favor.All of Skyshine’s Bedlam’s escapades are wrapped up in a post-apocalyptic shell that evokes the spirit of both Fallout and Mad Max. It’s nothing original, and the Newgrounds-style Flash animation do not add anything aesthetically. Still, however familiar it may be, you can’t help but appreciate the depth that comes with its world.Encompassing many different genres, Skyshine’s Bedlam will appeal to fans of a number of different genres. It may not be revolutionary, but the harsh world of Bedlam calls out to almost all types of gamer.Skyshine’s Bedlam Review – Gamers HeroesThe road to success is paved with failure, which is especially apparent in Sir Mr. Red’s new title NEO NEO.

      "By\nIan Birnbaum\n2015-09-22T21:42:20.264ZReviewA punishing take on the Rogue-inspired genre, Bedlam is weird and colorful and stressful.From inside my massive Dozer, I watch the wasteland roll by. A fortress on wheels, the Dozer supports thousands of passengers, a squad of security soldiers, supplies, and fast-growing vats of artificial meat supplies. It’s a brutal solution to a brutal problem: get these pilgrims across an apocalyptic desert and on to the paradise of Aztec City beyond.Bedlam is a game about taking risks and making hard choices. As the overseer of the Dozer, everything has a cost. Stopping to speak with a curious band of travelers will cost fuel, food, and days on the road. Finding out that they’re insane robots with corrupted, violent programs will eventually cost my soldiers a dead comrade and several days in hospital. Choosing to drive past them would have lost me the opportunity to loot hundreds of gallons of precious crude oil.It begins with a parade: the Dozer is leaving town and heading down the road to El Dorado. Looking down at a minimap, I choose a route along a winding, twisting road. After each leg, the map splits into several local diversions. These shorter roads don’t cost much to get to and always have a fight waiting at the end, but winning those fights gives the talented player a way to restock essentials like fuel, food, and power.The map and the choices made there is Bedlam’s brutal balancing act: driving costs fuel; you run out, the expedition is over. Transporting crew costs food; you run out, the expedition is over. Your soldiers have to fight for to restock these vitals; if they all die, the expedition is over. Doing anything or nothing takes time. The more days tick by, the more dangerous the wastes become.Along the way, NPC dialog and special encounters help flesh out the weird, Mad Max-ian fiction of Bedlam. I met mutants, seers, robots, cyborgs, bandits, and merchants—and only a few of those tried to kill me. I was eaten by giant sandworms and reinforced by wandering bands of refugees. Making a wasteland feel alive is tricky business—a wasteland is, by definition, a place where nothing lives—but Bedlam’s apocalypse is teeming with danger. The wonderful art is almost too colorful for a game set in the desert, and after several hours, I’m confident saying that Bedlam rocks my favorite soundtrack in any game since Bastion.Some special events give you an opportunity to upgrade the Dozer, making it more fuel efficient, or cheaper to use. It speaks to Bedlam’s incredible balance that I reached the end many times, but I always barely limped over the finish line. Even on the easiest difficulty Bedlam wasn’t a stroll in the park. On harder difficulties, I never made it across at all.There’s a second half to Bedlam, and I think it is the less successful half. Every fight that breaks out on the map screen is played out in an isometric grid. Squad members come in four classes, organized by weapon: sword, shotgun, pistol, and sniper rifle. These troops each specialize in different movement and firing ranges, and the resulting combat feels a little bit like chess, albeit heavily modified.Snipers in particular have a narrow field of fire, so I usually had to move my sniper two squares up and one to the left to take a shot. Each side gets two actions per turn, so using a sniper meant committing all of a turn to take that single shot. In my recent preview I noted that the snipers weren’t powerful enough to make up for their fragility, and I’m happy to see that they now punch a lot harder. Particularly in the early game, distance shooters are your best chance to take down a bad guy fast. Snipers have gotten even easier to kill since the early builds, though, so they absolutely have to be protected.Regardless of type, though, all of my soldiers are fragile. Casualties are to be expected, and that’s where Bedlam runs into the most trouble. I found it so completely impossible to escape from a battle unharmed—even when I enjoyed a total victory—that an empty barracks doomed my expedition more than any other cause. Bedlam provides warring incentives, forcing you to explore opportunities for supplies at the expense of a fragile, dwindling, and irreplaceable roster of doomed young people, and there’s no escaping it.Bedlam’s combat reminds me of XCOM’s approach to brutal permadeath, but the comparison is not flattering for Bedlam. XCOM thrives on the sense of danger and loss that accompanies every conflict because, no matter how bad things get, there are always more recruits. A green recruit is an unskilled pain in the ass, sure, but the worldwide XCOM project doesn’t end because of an unlucky grenade throw. In Bedlam, there are no new recruits, and more than one trip through the wasteland ended because a momentary mistake wiped out my entire squad. For me, this is where Bedlam crossed the line from enjoyably brutal to stressful frustration.In Bedlam, no matter what you do, you’re going to get screwed. When I did make it to the finish line, it was after an uncomfortably stressful trip that I stopped enjoying somewhere along the line. Bedlam is made of moments of relief and victory and tension and stress. Some people might stir that cocktail together and love the result. That kind of brutality can be appealing—the way Dark Souls is beloved for its challenge—and there’s no doubt Bedlam is a finely-crafted game with delicately balanced combat. But it's too menacing for me, and I am glad to be done sweating through it.What is it?

      "Canals (de_canals) is a bomb defusal map featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.On March 15, 2017 Canals was added to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, along with the Spectrum Case and new models for the Phoenix Connexion terrorists.The map recreates the general area around Piazza San Marco (also known as the St. Mark's Square) in Venice. Recreated landmarks include Doge's Palace (Palazzo Ducale), Bridge of Sighs (Ponte dei Sospiri), St Mark's Basilica, St Mark's Campanile, St Mark's Clocktower, and the Columns of San Marco and San Todaro. [1]The base of St Mark's Campanile serves as Bombsite A, while Bridge of Sighs serves as Bombsite B.Canals is based on real-world environments and the idea for the map Canals originally came to Iikka Keränen after visiting Venice.[2][3] Originally, the map was called de_venice but despite the shared name, it was not related to the earlier cancelled Venice map by Ido Magal.[2] The aesthetics were intentionally given a clean and uncluttered look despite the real-world influence to enhance player visibility.[3]Creator(s)Iikka KeränenGame(s)ScenarioBomb DefusalMap GroupDefusal Group SigmaTerroristsPhoenix ConnexionCounter-TerroristsSEAL Team 6First appearanceCounter-Strike: Global OffensiveLast appearanceCounter-Strike: Global OffensiveThis article/section is under construction.While this article/section is still under construction.

      "Infinite Space Explorers is a game of exploration and discoveries.  Fleets are moved from system to system on a star map.  New events occur, and new items and allies are found, along the way.  Conflict between competitive aliens is likely, and combat between starship fleets is almost certain.  All such interaction is handled by brisk card play.ISE is designed to set up and play easily and quickly, yet provide the essence of a star spanning galactic adventure.  Discoveries are randomized so each game is different.Infinite Space Explorers includes:ISE is based on the award winning indie computer games, Strange Adventures in Infinite Space and Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space and features the same oddball aliens, peculiar artifacts, exotic starships and artwork by Bill \"Phosphorous\" Sears.Please note that because of the particular board configuration used, ISE is played as either a two player game or as a four player game.  Rules for solo and three player games are not included.UPDATE: Infinite Space Explorers X-1 -- the first card expansion for Infinite Space Explorers -- has been released.

      "We have now reached our initial goal, but are still seeking funds for improvements to the game. See explanations of the Stretch Goals in earlier update.Latest update (4/28/2013): Success! Plus, art team members finally revealed!A long time (12 years) ago in a galaxy far, far away (a suburb of Seattle) three people working full-time in the game industry got together in their spare time and created something with a long name: Strange Adventures in Infinite Space. It was a genre-busting indie classic, with 8-bit graphics not because it was hip and retro but because I based its graphics engine largely on \"Windows Game Programming for Dummies\".Its strengths were in its quirky, humorous writing and the addictive nature of the short-form gameplay where your brutal defeat in combat would have you click the restart button rather than giving up. SAIS would soon be called \"The Perfect Short Game\" in an article by a Real Famous Game Designer and get all manner of accolades, followed by a sequel with an equally long name: Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space. In the meantime I had read up on OpenGL so the game was a bit easier on the eyes. It also made quite a splash and gained a cult following, partly because it was designed with user-made mods in mind.At its core, Sea of Stars is a single-player science fiction roguelike similar to Strange Adventures and Weird Worlds. Turn-based star map navigation is combined with a real-time combat system. The game provides a randomly generated open world for you to explore, and will only reveal a fraction of its secrets each time you play. There is no going back to a saved game - everything you do has a permanent effect. Death is frequent, but only makes you want to try again.Although Sea of Stars builds on the universe you visited in the earlier games, it is expanded with fresh new material and gameplay. Discovering the interactions between items, alien races, characters and random events will keep you busy for years - yet each session of the game is a complete adventure that you can finish in one sitting. To extend the game's longevity even further, we encourage people to make mods and even provide tools for it!One thing that has advanced since Weird Worlds is technology. I wrote a 3D engine for our previous game, Data Jammers: FastForward, and a lot of the code will now be reused to expand the Infinite Space universe into the third dimension. Other games and projects have resulted in a variety of subsystems, from procedural texturing to mundane data file handling. All kinds of fun and useful stuff.However, what will really set this game apart from its predecessors is what we are going to do within this expanded universe. The Sea of Stars will be more alive than before, both reacting to the player's actions and acting on its own. Locations like star bases will be real places with more to do than just trade items, and you may have to attack or defend one in combat. Individual NPCs as well as alien war fleets will go about their business that may or may not be aligned with your interests, and you will have to pick sides. Technology available to you as well as others will advance as time passes, including larger ships showing up.Of course, we won't forget the mod creators who helped make Weird Worlds great. Not only will all the content use standard file formats so you can use any editor of your choice, we will actually release tools to make things easier. This will ultimately evolve into a full-fledged mod editor within the game that will help you put it all together.Digital Eel is an independent game developer consisting of two guys, Iikka Keranen (programming, design, art) and Rich Carlson (audio, design, art). We have both been in the game industry since the 1990's and released a plethora of commercial titles while working on Digital Eel games on the side. Counting our video and tabletop games, Digital Eel has shipped sixteen titles. Between 2001 and his passing in 2012, we were joined by Bill \"Phosphorous\" Sears, a fellow game industry veteran and an amazing artist whose creative input will be sorely missed.Our games have won various awards, including four Independent Games Festival awards: Dr. Blob's Organism won the audio and visual art categories (2004), Weird Worlds (2006) and Brainpipe (2009) won in the audio category. Weird Worlds was also the Quest/Adventure game of the year at Game Tunnel and was nominated for the Seumas McNally grand prize at IGF.Sea of Stars will require quite a bit of content to be created, from starship models and character illustrations to music and sound effects. Without funding, it would be up to me (Iikka) and Rich to create all of it. Our estimated release date would be in the latter half of 2014, and Rich would possibly have to sell his cats to science.The good news is that there are several experienced artists as well as a great composer who have offered to work with us (Their names will be revealed when the project reaches its funding goal). With their help we can get this game done this year, and with your help we can pay them for it.When you make your pledge of $10 or more to support us, you don't just get the warm fuzzy feeling that comes from helping out an indie developer. You will also get goodies ranging from a digital copy of the game to tangible keepsakes that you will be able to pass down to your future descendants living on Gliese 581g. Check them out below.Digital copy of the game: Get Sea of Stars for PC as soon as it is released.Other Digital Eel games: At various pledge amounts we will throw in copies of our other titles, from PC games to board games. At the higher levels, your name and email address will be added to a list of customers who will receive every Digital Eel game as long as we keep making them! This is not a hollow promise; we intend to continue Digital Eel indefinitely.Beta participation: Get in the game before it hits the stores. The beta will start when the game is feature-complete but content and gameplay balance are still in development. Your feedback will influence the final product.Art prints: Receive a piece of Sea of Stars concept art or other art related to the Infinite Space universe. At higher pledge amounts, prints will be larger and more impressive. They will also be numbered and signed by the artist.Name a star or planet: Write your name among the stars! Every time someone plays the game they will be able to find at least one star and one planet named by Kickstarter backers. It could be your (last) name or a name you invented.Name a starship captain: Your name, or a name of your choice, is added to the roster of starship captain names in the game. These names may appear as the player character's name or a human NPC.Physical artifacts: Receive a solid piece of Sea of Stars memorabilia. These will be special, limited edition pieces only made for Kickstarter backers. At higher pledge amounts, the artifacts will be larger and more impressive with features such as gold plating.Create an item: Have an idea or even a sketch for a cool thing you want to find in the game? We'll work with you to create a lifeform, starship weapon, system or artifact as close to your concept as possible. One or more of these items will appear in the game each time it is played, so many people will see it!Create an event: Add your touch to the ever-changing story of Infinite Space. We will create an in-game event, mission or quest based on your idea.Appear in the game: We will create a prominent in-game character based on your photograph (yourself, a family member or friend) or sketch. The character may be a heroic space pilot, a villain, a star merchant... Our choice, but always someone you will regularly meet in the game.Design a starship or space station: We will create an in-game starship or space station based on your sketch or idea. These will be featured prominently either as ships you can command or space ports you can visit, or in a unique event or quest built around it. You will also receive a one of a kind, gold-plated metallic model of your ship or station as your \"physical artifact\".Your name in the credits: To recognize your generosity, the highest-level backers will have their names included in a special \"thank you\" section of the game's credits (you can opt out if you wish).In video game business, surprises are almost inevitable no matter how experienced you are. The largest risk is that the game could take longer to finish than expected, for example due to additional gameplay balancing required to make it more fun or to remove exploits. We don't wish to ship the game until it feels just right. If there were a significant delay, we would consider making a beta version available to all pre-purchasers in December 2013.Another possible source of delays is the amount of content required. If we missed our deadline because of unfinished content, it would be possible for us to slightly reduce the scope of the game for an initial release and then expand it in a free update. This would most likely be funded by the initial sales.Questions about this project?

    "title": "Darkest Dungeon",
    "text": [
      "Darkest Dungeon is a role-playing video game developed and published by Red Hook Studios. The game, following an Early Access development period, was released in multiple platforms on January 19, 2016, for Microsoft Windows and OS X, with a release for PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Linux a few months later. An iPad version was released in August 2017. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released on January 18, 2018, while an Xbox One version was released on February 28, 2018.\nDarkest Dungeon has the player manage a roster of heroes to explore dungeons below a gothic mansion the player has inherited. Played out in a mix of real-time movement and turn-based combat, a core feature of Darkest Dungeon is the stress level of each hero that increases with further exploration and combat; a character sustaining a high stress level may gain afflictions that will hamper, or possibly enhance, their performance as an explorer.\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, garnering several award nominations, and went on to sell over two million copies.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nAt the outset of Darkest Dungeon, the player learns that they have inherited an estate from a relative who, while seeking fame and fortune by excavating the dungeons and catacombs beneath their manor, has unearthed portals to dark dimensions and released a number of horrific and evil creatures onto the world. As the current owner of the estate and the surrounding lands, the player must recruit a roster of adventurers and mount expeditions to cleanse the estate of its vile inhabitants.\nAs the player ventures into the manor, the dungeons below it, and the surrounding lands, they find their relative's memoirs telling of the terrible deeds he had done in pursuit of knowledge and power. Eventually, the player is able to send a party into the titular Darkest Dungeon, the source of the land's corruption, taking steps to reveal its ultimate form. Within the deepest chamber, the player encounters the disembodied spirit of their ancestor, who now remains as \"an Avatar of the Crawling Chaos.\" After defeating the ancestor's apparition, the party battles the Heart of Darkness - revealed to be the progenitor of all life on the planet. The party manages to defeat its physical form at great cost, but the ancestor's spirit reveals to the player that this has only delayed its inevitable awakening and, by extension, the end of the world. The ancestor explains that this is merely part of an endless cycle in the player's lineage, and that the player will eventually meet the same fate as he, and their descendants onward. The ancestor then accentuates this cycle by repeating his first words from the start of the game: \"Ruin has come to our family.\"\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a role-playing game in which the player manages a roster of heroes and adventurers to explore these dungeons and fight the creatures within. Prior to entering a dungeon, the player can use facilities in a town near the mansion to dismiss or recruit more heroes, send heroes to perform various activities that will heal them, gain new combat or camping skills, reduce their stress, or remove any afflictions that they incurred while in a dungeon, and buy and sell equipment and supplies to outfit their heroes, using money and loot gained during dungeon runs. Many of these facilities can also be improved to add more benefits or options to the player. The player can recruit up to twenty-five heroes on their roster at any time; each hero belongs to one of fifteen character classes, and has their own statistics and skills that can be upgraded over time. If a hero dies while exploring a dungeon, that hero is lost for good.\nSurrounding the Hamlet and the facilities that the player uses are four different areas that must be cleared before the Darkest Dungeon can be accessed. They are: \n\nThe Ruins: the ancient tombs and hallways of the player's ancestors, now crawling with skeletons and mad cultists, and host to a Necromancer and a mad prophet that are both there due to the Ancestor's machinations.\nThe Weald: the overgrown forest that surrounds the hamlet, now home to slime monsters, bandits, mad dogs, and cannibalistic hags.\nThe Cove: the murky caves beneath the cliff that the manor sits on, inhabited by fish-men and bandits, along with a Siren and a ghostly Pirate crew.\nThe Warrens: the sewers of the manor, filled with offal and swarmed with pig-men and other forms of misshapen flesh that are the misguided product of the Ancestor's first attempts at demon-summoning.Once enough heroes have been built up to the appropriate levels, they are sent into the Darkest Dungeon itself, where the final boss resides.\nOnce the player has completed preparations, they select four of their heroes to go explore a dungeon. Access to most dungeons requires completing several previous dungeons and collecting specific types of loot, with such later dungeons being more difficult than the earlier ones. Dungeons are procedurally-generated in a roguelike manner, and presented as a series of interconnected rooms with hallways between each. The parties move between rooms in a real-time, side-scrolling view, with the potential to discover interesting objects to search or random combat encounters during this time. When the party reaches a room, they may be forced into combat, but once clear the room remains a safe zone allowing the player to apply healing and other remedies to the party. When combat occurs, it plays out in a turn-based manner, with each character having their own order based on initiative that changes each turn. Heroes can use attacks, magic, special skills, or items during their turn to defeat the other party. The order which the party moves through the passages and rooms is critical as it affects who may interact with various items, and the available actions that a character can do while in combat; for example, a swordsman in the back of the party cannot easily attack, while range-attack characters like archers and mages can. The positions of heroes can be changed around, but this can consume time or a combat turn. While each dungeon has a target goal, the player can opt to leave the dungeon at any time, retaining all loot collected but forgoing the larger reward for clearing out the dungeon.\nA core element of Darkest Dungeon is its Affliction system, a concept of a hero's stress level or resolve. Though a hero will have little stress when they are hired, it will worsen from a number of factors encountered while in a dungeon, such as adventuring without food or light sources, seeing the death or wounding of a fellow party member in battle, or from blights cast on them by enemies. If the hero's high stress remains unchecked, they may develop afflictions that will interfere with the behavior of the character, such as being frightened and unable to fight directly. Less frequently, a stressed character may develop virtues that enhance their attributes, such as becoming more invigorated within battle. Some afflictions, left unchecked, may become permanent quirks that remain on the character. Other afflictions can be removed back in the village and by performing special activities, such as drinking at a bar or repenting at a church, that occupy the character's time, preventing them from being part of a dungeon party.  Allowing a hero to reach an extremely high stress level can cause them to have a heart attack, bringing them to the brink of death if not immediately tended to.  Stress can be lowered while in a dungeon through camping offered at specific locations, or other restorative items, as well as when back in the nearby town. While camping, the characters will have another set of available skills that can be used to help relieve stress and help with other party members.\nThere are two other game modes aside from Darkest mode, which is the \"Normal\" mode for Darkest Dungeon. The first is Radiant mode, designed to reduce the length of time to complete the campaign without compromising the core difficulty with the game. In Radiant mode, level limitations are less strict, the player gets to recruit stronger heroes and hero XP gain is accelerated. The second mode is Stygian mode, which is a much more difficult and challenging mode. Stygian mode not only has enemies with increased health and damage and an increase in light depletion, but a failure condition. Should the player fail to complete the game within 86 in-game weeks or have 13 or more heroes killed, the 'Thing' will be awoken causing a game over and the save file to be deleted. Also note that Radiant and Darkest mode give the player the option to toggle off gameplay features that increase the game difficulty, whereas the player cannot toggle these in Stygian mode.\n\n\n=== Downloadable content ===\n\"The Crimson Court\" DLC was released on June 19, 2017 for PC and August 22, 2017 for PlayStation 4, introducing a Courtyard environment, a new playable class, a faction with new enemies, five new boss encounters, as well as new trinkets and Hamlet upgrade buildings. Also of note is that a hero can be turned into a vampire via the Crimson Curse, a new status effect introduced in the DLC.\nThe next DLC, \"The Colour of Madness\", was released on June 19, 2018. Narratively, it has a meteor crash near the village that causes some of the villagers to turn into zombie-like creatures. This leads to new dungeons, monsters, and other aspects of gameplay. This will also add a new mode, a horde mode, where the player's party must survive as many encounters as they can against these new creatures.\n\n\n== Development ==\nChris Bourassa and Tyler Sigman had become friends while working at Backbone Entertainment, and had talked about the idea of building a game together, but their commitments to other studios left them unable to do so. During 2012 and early 2013, they had brainstormed a number of ideas for potential games to develop. In April 2013, they found they had the time to work on this project, and decided it was a \"now or never\" moment, forming British Columbia-based Red Hook Studios to develop the game. By 2015, their team included six people in addition to three more supporting their sound, music, and narration for the game.\nThe main gameplay of Darkest Dungeon started out as a tile-based game that had the player control a group of characters as they moved about in a dungeon, eventually transitioning into a combat mode when they had encounters. The two recognized that players would get bored of looking at icons of the characters' heads all the time via the top-down icons, which would not allow players to come to bond with the characters. This led to the concept of presenting characters from the side view in combat, making the player feel they were at the same level as the characters, alleviating some of these issues. This also enabled Bourassa, the principle artist on the game, have an opportunity to show off more of his work. However, this would have left them the need to transition from top-down to side-view and create more art assets. They worked around this by using the same side-view not only for combat but for dungeon exploration, creating the basic gameplay of Darkest Dungeon.The side-view mechanic then led into the idea of the characters being in ranks, allowing for certain attacks, abilities, or defenses if they were in the right rank; characters in the front could have powerful melee attacks but take more damage, while characters in the back would be more protected but limited to weaker ranged attacks. This was an idea inspired by The Bard's Tale, but they were able to expand upon it to create interesting situations, such as having characters pulled out of rank by an enemy attack. This in turn led to a new attribute for how likely a character could be moved out of position, creating strategies for the player as to handle a mix-up in the ranks during combat, as well as applying the same principles of rank to the enemy forces and making situations for the player to figure out how to take advantage of a weak rank arrangement. Furthering from these concepts, they crafted the character classes to have various strengths and weaknesses based on their rank positioning, created further strategic elements for the player to explore.One core idea of the game was its Affliction system, in which the dungeon-crawling characters would gain stress and eventually afflictions as they explored. Bourassa and Sigman noted that while they are fans of classic role-playing games such as The Bard's Tale, Eye of the Beholder, and Ultima Underworld, most of these games lacked the human element to the characters. They give an example of a character being down to their last hit point in battle and the player simply making decisions to win, the character reacting regardless of their low health. They instead wanted to \"toy with player agency\", giving moments where the player is reminded they do not have full control of the actions of the adventurers in the party. They also sought to alter how most loot systems in role-playing games work so that the player was not always focused on finding the best gear for the characters but instead working to support their characters. Bourassa and Sigman were aware that these facets may turn players away from the game due to the difficulty and inability to have full control, but continued to stay true to their vision of the game.The Affliction system was inspired by  psychologically traumatized heroes, both through historical events as well as works of fiction such as Hudson from Aliens and the soldiers from Band of Brothers who are transformed by the horrors of combat; Sigman pointed to the seventh episode of Band of Brothers where a soldier watches his friends die from a shell explosion, stares transfixed at the event, and then becomes unable to fight any more, as the feeling they wanted to capture. Though they were also inspired by Lovecraftian horror, they did not want to use the concept of \"insanity\" that is common in that genre, and instead focused more on the nature of stress and how it affected the human psyche. Because of the importance of the Affliction system to Darkest Dungeon, the developers spent significant time to make sure that the impact of stress and afflictions were emphasized dramatically in the game's presentation, using special graphics and sound cues to signal the onset of an affliction. They also created a \"bark system\", dialog stated by a character reflecting their current stress, affliction, and other attributes as another means to humanize the characters and remind the player that they do not have full control of the characters. Alongside the Affliction system, they developed the town facilities that are used to cure afflictions and reduce stress, using concepts they borrowed from tabletop games. They also included Virtues, positive afflictions that can result from high stress situations, and a means of tracking the afflictions of a given character over time, so that in future stress situations the character will often become encumbered by the same afflication, developing a behavioral pattern that the player may be able to use to their benefit.A disembodied narrator, voiced by Wayne June, was also included to comment in a sardonic manner throughout the game, furthering the atmosphere they wanted. Bourassa had listened to June's readings of various H.P. Lovecraft works prior to developing the game, which partially inspired Darkest Dungeon. When the two were preparing the game's first teaser trailing, they felt they needed a narrator and approached June for his work. Once the trailer was completed, they recognized that June's voice as narrator was a necessary element for the game. Art assets were created by Bourassa; in addition to the Lovecraftian nature, he wanted to give the game the look of woodcut and illuminated manuscripts, and took inspiration from eastern European artists such as Albrecht Dürer. He further modernized the look by using ideas from comic book artists including Mike Mignola, Guy Davis, Chris Bachalo, and Viktor Kalvachev. The game uses a homebrewed, lightweight cross-platform game engine developed by programmer Kelvin McDowell.\n\n\n=== Release ===\nBourassa and Sigman used their personal savings to fund the creation of Red Hook Studios, and sought to gain a grant from the Canada Media Fund, but were rejected. Having originally anticipated an eighteen-month development period, they sought a way to fund the extended development period. They launched a Kickstarter campaign in April 2014 for funding; prior to starting the Kickstarter, they made sure they had prepared enough of a media interest, including a trailer for the game released in October 2013, to attract attention at the onset of the campaign. Due to the early marketing, the funding goal of $75,000 was reached within the first two days of the campaign, and completed with over $313,000 of funding from over 10,000 backers.Darkest Dungeon was released on Steam Early Access on January 30, 2015 for Early Access backers, and Steam Early Access on February 3, 2015 for the public. They used feedback from the Early Access period, particularly through those that streamed their playthrough of the game, to help with playtesting and adjust the balance of the game, while also finding that their approach to gameplay and presentation was validated by positive reception from these streamers. Sigman noted that developing in Early Access was comparable to \"working while naked in a transparent cube suspended above Times Square\", but felt their transparency with players made the final product much better. Bourassa and Sigman noted that they had had some issues with user feedback during Early Access, specifically after they added two gameplay elements around July 2015: the addition of corpses which affected combat positioning issues, and the possibility of a stressed character suffering a heart attack and dying immediately. Some Early Access players were dissatisfied with these changes, feeling it put the player at far too much disadvantage to an already difficult game, and complained to the studio. Bourassa and Sigman had debated what to do with these two features and eventually opted to make them optional elements to gameplay. Though this change was generally met with approval, a number of these players remained bitter about the game throughout the rest of its development, and attempted to have the studio's and the game's reputation derided by Jim Sterling, who has frequently been critical of Steam and Early Access titles; Sterling instead found the game to enjoyable even with this change. Bourassa and Sigman recognized they could have done a better job in the social media to placate the complaints early on, but still felt they chose the right path with retaining these features and sticking to their vision instead of trying to meet all expectations from Early Access players.Though Red Hook anticipated releasing the game in October 2015, a personal loss affected one of the team members, and the game was subsequently released on January 19, 2016 for personal computers. A cross-buy version for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita were originally planned for release in the second quarter of 2016, but was pushed back to Q3 2016 to improve playability with the Sony controllers as well as to prepare these versions to align with new features to be introduced in the personal computer versions prior to this release. This version was released on September 27, 2016.The game's first major update in May 2016 following its full release, \"Everything Burns\", which among bug fixes and other small improves, adds in Town Events, where upon return to the town the player may encounter a random reward, such an extra recruit to join their party, or the temporary closure of one of the town facilities. Following on the previous issues with Early Access updates, some of these features can be eliminated or their frequency reduced in the game's options menu.The game's first downloadable content, \"The Crimson Court\", was released on June 19, 2017 on personal computers with the PlayStation 4 version to come later. The new content added a new hero class, a new dungeon type, new enemies and bosses, and other similar content to the game. Integration with Steam Workshop was added in an April 2017 update. Red Hook plans to develop additional downloadable content, to develop for other platforms, specifically highlight touch-based devices as they found their interface is already well-suited to this input mode.A version for iPad was released on August 24, 2017.

      "Despair overtakes you as your houndmaster misses an all-important attack on an enemy fusilier, the lighter of the brigand’s massive boss cannon. The cannon is going to fire this turn, and there’s nothing left you can do to stop it. While your leper and bounty hunter land the finishing blows on the massive machine, your plague doctor and houndmaster fail to survive the encounter, joining the legions of the dead that occupy the hamlet’s graveyard. Dead champions never return, but their memory will haunt you through all the battles and dungeons yet to come.Tremendous highs and tumultuous lows combine in the Lovecraft-inspired, turn-based dungeon-crawler Darkest Dungeon. You’re always one hit point or one mind sliver away from complete collapse as you explore winding halls of ruins, warrens, coves, and the titular Darkest Dungeon itself. Featuring permadeath, procedurally generated levels, and some aspects of permanent progression as the player builds up the decrepit hamlet into a bustling economy, the game is ultimately about finding combinations of curious glory seekers and treasure hunters and putting them to work against swarms of deadly and debilitating monsters.This dread ensemble is a pleasure to manage down to the finest details. With 14 different classes to choose from, each with many unique abilities, weapons to customize, skills to upgrade, quirks to manage, and diseases and afflictions to cure, you’re always managing something.With perseverance, you can even the odds against the nightmares ahead. The game strikes a brilliant balance most of the time, constantly testing the player to weigh resources and risks, but training a fresh team after a massive loss can be time consuming and punishing. This too, can be an important lesson: In Darkest Dungeon, discretion is often the better part of valor, and while mechanics make cowardice costly, it’s far better than losing a team to the grave forever.Your hamlet will continue to improve even if your characters continue to head toward the grave, as most standard dungeon runs offer resources to help you upgrade your facilities. It’s an important and satisfying mechanic that gives some sense of progression even in the face of overwhelming odds.Darkest Dungeon tweaks the traditional task of managing character hit points by adding another element called stress. Darkness, enemy attacks, critical strikes, and watching comrades fall can all cause despair.A full stress bar gives the hero a chance for greatness in the face of terror, but the more likely outcome is a serious malady such as masochistic or antagonistic tendencies, which could lead your characters to injure themselves, become unresponsive to your orders, or chastise the rest of the team into deep depression.Managing these two resources along with light sources, provisions, and other supply items as you traverse the depths makes for an insightful lesson in risk-management, and it feels wonderfully satisfying when you deliver the deathblow to a crawling chaos. Depending on the dungeon run, your heroes may come back with diseases, maladies, or stress that should be taken care within the hamlet before sending them out to venture again, making the construction of many different teams a necessity so some can adventure while others rest.Darkest Dungeon boasts plenty of substance and style, but if you’re averse to crushing difficulty it may prove to be too frustrating to be palatable. The uncompromising difficulty and challenge will be attractive to some, but could put off players looking for a simple crawler where you can outlevel or outgear content, and the sometimes grindy nature of recouping losses can take its toll.Darkest Dungeon is an incredible take on the classic dungeon crawl. The game brings Lovecraftian lore to new heights with cool classes, powerful narration, stylish art, and addictive gameplay that will keep you crawling back to battle slithering monstrosities even as your favorite heroes become corpses.© 1991 to \n  document.write(new Date().getFullYear());\n Game Informer.

      "By\nIan Birnbaum\n2016-01-20T10:24:28.19ZReviewA wonderfully executed, brilliantly stressful reinvention of party-based dungeon-crawling, Darkest Dungeon is great fun, even when its cruel.The first one to lose his mind is the plague doctor. His crow-faced mask wobbles as his sanity snaps, and he starts to pour abuse on his comrades. As the party fights unholy monsters in the crypts beneath a swamp, the chaos and his shouting break the rest. An armored paladin falls dead from a heart attack. Another chokes on a cloud of spores thrown by a monstrous, sentient fungus. The mad plague doctor runs alone out of the dark. He’s sent to the sanitarium. Like all veterans of bloody conflict, he’ll never be the person he was before.In Darkest Dungeon, this disaster is known as “Week 3.” Every week goes about as well. Dungeon diving and tomb raiding have been staples of PC gaming for decades, but Darkest Dungeon is the first time I felt how awful this quest must be for the people involved. In Darkest Dungeon, explorers don’t just have to bandage their wounds and sharpen their axes—their biggest vulnerability is their minds.After getting bored drinking and fornicating his way through the family fortune, your dear father decided to investigate rumors of wondrous magic buried deep beneath the ancestral home. But he and his workmen dug too greedily and awoke an ancient evil, sending the countryside into ruin. Just before he sends a musket ball through his brain, dear old dad sends you a letter: come home, rebuild the local village, and defeat the evil. Bang. Splat.Once the road to town is reopened, you recruit heroes and send them into the dungeons four at a time. When (if) they return, they are damaged, stressed out, and hopefully a bit richer. While in town they can drink, gamble, pray—whatever they need to get their heads sorted out so they can walk back into the long dark. One half of Darkest Dungeon is managing this growing town, opening and upgrading blacksmith shops and taverns to give your heroes an edge in the fight.The other half is the real meat and potatoes: leading sidescrolling parties of four heroes in turn-based combat against otherworldly horrors. Entering a dungeon brings up a map showing a simple floorplan: a few rooms connected by hallways. There’s no need to explore, and most levels ask you to explore the entire level anyway. The map’s real purpose is to show you how much of the level remains. If things are going poorly and you still have half a dozen rooms to clear, it’s probably time to wave the white flag and get out.When your party of maniacs runs up against a squad of horrors, a short, turn-based battle starts. Combatants take turns using abilities to attack, heal, or cast spells. Especially at the beginning of the game, I found the few characters and abilities available made these battles more of a slog. Combat gets more fun as more character types arrive in town and new abilities get unlocked. Battles are always tense, though, and I found myself dreading them as expeditions grew longer and more dangerous.It’s hard enough keeping everyone alive, but battles put adventurers under a lot of stress, too. Seeing a friend die or barely surviving a critical attack has a tendency to make people freak out. When characters crack, they take on random debilitating traits like “abusive” or “afraid.” This is the well-executed balancing act of Darkest Dungeon: I love trying to keep people healthy and sane. It’s easy to do one or the other, but that’s not enough. Your heroes can die just as easily from a heart attack as from a sword.I also enjoyed tinkering with character classes in different party positions. The order of the heroes is important, with heavily armored tanks taking the front spot and spell-casters, archers, and healers holding in the back. Most melee attacks can only be aimed at the front ranks, and some spells can only be cast from the middle of a group. The most interesting classes are those in the middle. I enjoyed experimenting with characters who could fight in a melee role from one spot, but a support role from another.During one of my early expeditions, I had poured through character sheets to find the perfect set of four heroes and assigned them in the perfect order. In the team’s first battle, an enemy summoner opened a portal to hell. A massive tentacle reached through it and grabbed my healer, shoving her to the front of the party and flipping my careful plan right on its ass. Darkest Dungeon’s greatest delight is finding new ways to screw you.Calling Darkest Dungeon merely “Lovecraftian” is a disservice to the mythology developer Red Hook has built here. (It’s also an undue compliment to H. P. Lovecraft’s one-note writing.) Both the heroes (occultists, Amazonians, thieves, paladins, plague doctors, lepers, bounty hunters, rogues) and the enemies (skeletons, zombies, ghosts, enthralled souls, fish-people, mushroom-monsters, spiders, maggots) draw from a huge sampling of source material, and I love its unexpected variety.Darkest Dungeon is exceptional for how carefully-built and deliberate all its parts are. Every sound effect, every splash of color, and every character and ability all work to create an environment inspired by low fantasy novels and pulpy weird-horror magazines. When the Vestal, an acolyte of a Roman goddess of purifying fire, became racked with fear, she would cry out for her god’s protection in the darkness. When the hound master lost his mind to stress, he became bitter and withdrawn, commenting that his bumbling companions lacked proper training. I love that Darkest Dungeon takes inspiration from so many sources, yet uses all of those pieces to create character classes that serve a clever, foreboding fiction.There’s an important distinction, though, between the character classes and the individuals. The classes are interesting and unique, but the individuals are just meat for the grinder. The worst thing about Darkest Dungeon is coming to grips with the idea that there can be no perfection. As a habitual save-scummer, this was hard for me. The auto-save feature is always on, so every mistake, every critical hit or critical miss, is permanent. Every death is permadeath.This can be especially frustrating in early missions, when the slow trickle of heroes and their low-level abilities don’t always give you the tools you need to handle the pain coming your way. After an easy first mission, I consistently lost people, abandoned missions, or wrote off entire expeditions in the early weeks. During one very frustrating expedition, my healer kept everyone in tip-top health, but I had no way to manage stress. The mission ended in disgrace when four completely able-bodied adventurers died in an unprecedented quadruple heart attack. I’ve played a lot of permadeath strategy games, but I’ve never experienced a squad wipe due to acute mental distress before.One of the reasons I love Darkest Dungeon is that measuring the mental toll of adventuring feels so overdue. Game violence has been consequence-free for a long time, but that’s changing. The new Tomb Raider games show Lara Croft dealing with profound mental trauma, for example, and games like Viscera Cleanup Detail poke at shooters’ carefree bodycount.Maybe it’s even part of a growing cultural awareness of the cost of violence. With thousands of new veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, PTSD has become a household word. I think it’s fine to avoid the complex topic in a videogame, but walking into the subject directly is gripping where an artful evasion is the norm. This isn’t to say that Darkest Dungeon makes any kind of statement about veteran care or the cost of real war, but I do think these themes are engaging. Battling demons in a dungeon would really mess people up, and that’s not often acknowledged through game design in such a pronounced way.The more I played, the more I grew detached from the heroes in my roster. I even refused to rename or invest in the veterans of multiple tours—exactly the opposite of my squads in XCOM, which were all customized and named for family and friends. Becoming attached would make it more stressful to send them on another ill-conceived quest for trinkets and coin, and even more disappointing when they came back broken and despondent. When the cost is measured in sanity and blood, the most powerful lesson Darkest Dungeon taught me about adventuring is that it isn’t always worth doing.What is it?

      "I love the psychological approach they take to dungeoneering. Who wouldn't get scared when facing monsters and bad guys. It gives it a more realistic feel in my opinion.",
      "When the going gets tough, the Crusader gets off, wildly swinging his broadsword in masochistic glee. Another member of the party is suddenly gripped with existential dread and is frozen with fear. The healer does her best until she falls victim, forever, to a combination of hysteria and slow-acting poison, and the mage casts her magic, but she’s in a poor position and falls victim to a barrage of arrows and a fear-indiced heart attack . And this ragtag quartet has only reached the third room of the dungeon. Now in final release after over a year in Early Access, Darkest Dungeon might just be one of the simplest yet simultaneously nuanced games you’ll play. Kudos to Red Hook Studios for layering their game with subtlety and depth in a way that isn’t opaque or confusing, instead being a great lesson on how to balance accessibility and complexity.Darkest Dungeon is a roguelike, heavily invested in what have become the fundamental tenets of the genre: character permadeath and procedurally generated levels that are just as likely to present a major foe in the second room as the twentieth. If you’re wary of the genre, at least take heart that in Darkest Dungeon, the combat is thoughtful and turn-based and there is some chance that careful preparation and savvy character management will see you through.First impressions are important, and thanks to its excellent voice over narration, evocative music, and dark, 2D gothic graphic novel art style Darkest Dungeon makes a great one, intriguing and grabbing the new player immediately. While the story is paper thin, it’s narrated with appropriate gravitas throughout, and that includes the ongoing narrative “color commentary” during the battles. After starting the game, it’s only a matter of moments before your four-member party is plunged into a dungeon crawl.Turn-based enemy encounters are the main course in Darkest Dungeon, and they are in one sense, totally as expected, with each character electing to use his or her turn to fight, heal, or use healing or buffing items on themselves or the party. There are over 14 different classes of heroes and naturally they have unique skills and abilities to bring to the fight. Positioning in the lineup during combat is incredibly important and sometimes characters will relocate to the back of the party on their own to heal or be sheltered, or out of cowardice. Or, they might rush forward in a show of unwise bravado.Darkest Dungeon calls the changing psychological states of the characters the Affliction System, based on the premise — and really, this is the biggest hook of the game — that the stress of exploring will impact the mental and emotional health of characters in many different ways. Some will see their comrades fall and be disheartened, while others will be inspired to fight harder. Some will call on God for help, and some will have a crisis of faith and lose the will to live. Some characters are masochists and love the pain of their wounds, other will be so frightened that they have a heart attack and die.To some small extent, the player can mitigate the influence of these emotional states through spells, potions, and healing items, but a more effective strategy is taking a balanced group into battle. The party is assembled in town out of an ever-expanding roster of characters who arrive at the tavern on the stagecoach. After a few rounds, all the town’s healing and crafting opportunities are available. You can send the more zealous heros to heal at the church, or rest a more sexually deviant character at the town’s bordello. Each of the businesses can be extensively upgraded which in turn makes the heroes that much stronger and more capable. Like in X-Com, one becomes attached to heroes and tries hard to hold onto the most skilled ones, but there will come a time when they are lost in battle forever. Death in Darkest Dungeon is permanent.The dungeons — each linked to a chapter of the game’s story — themselves are represented on the minimap as straight hallways and rooms, and each dungeon has several stages. Exploring each section of the dungeon reveals not only a plethora of enemy encounters but traps, chests, piles of books, and progress-blocking rubble. Sometimes an innocuous stack of dusty volumes will strike a member of the party with terror when the books are read. Having an adequate supply of consumables is critical. Shovels clear rubble out of the way, bandages can be used during battle, and of course, heroes have to eat to maintain their strength.Closing Comments:Darkest Dungeon is difficult, but not because its systems are unclear or unfair. In fact, the richness and complexity of its mechanics are miraculously transparent. What makes Darkest Dungeon challenging is balancing and equipping a party and the essentially unpredictable nature of the dungeons and combat. The art style — hand-drawn and evocative, with just enough effective animation to keep things interesting without adding overwhelm to the already busy nature of the action — is beautiful, and its music and stentorian narration are perfectly in sync with the characters. The whole enterprise is polished and a lot of fun.Version Reviewed: PC",
      "Introduction —Over the last decade, being an independent developer has gotten a bit easier. The creation of digital marketplace websites, such as “Steam” and “Good Old Games,” along with the continued popularity of social media websites, have helped up-and-coming developers promote, advertise and sell their games to the masses. While this incredible evolution in the video game industry has helped plenty of indie developers, the difficulties to stand out among the crowd still remain. Nevertheless, one indie game has managed to cut through the noise, and provide an authentic and highly original video game experience titled, “Darkest Dungeon.”The Game“Darkest Dungeon” is a turn-based, role-playing-game, developed and published by “Redhook Studios” in early 2016. Starting up this indie title, you are immediately transported into a stunningly bleak and dark world. An old man, tells you a story of how his once beloved manor became corrupted and over-run by monsters, demons, and the occult. And how this place, that used to be a beacon of justice, was engulfed into utter darkness by his moral failings, and unending curiosity, that sent him down a path of madness, despair, and eventually, suicide. This flawed man was your father.Now, a final handwritten message was sent to you by your flawed familial connection, pleading that you travel back to the old manor that was once your home, and drive the forces of the damned back to the hell in which they came, back to the “Darkest Dungeon.” While the story of the “Darkest Dungeon” feels freshly plucked from the infamous tales written by “H.P. Lovecraft” or “Edgar Allen Poe,” every other aspect of this game, from its addictive gameplay to its completely hand-drawn world, is dripping with originality and immense creativity.The GameplayThe gameplay in the “Darkest Dungeon” revolves around two key phases that I call, the “town management phase” and the “dungeon exploration phase.” During the town management phase, you click on different buildings to upgrade, find new explorers to add to your roster, and, if need be, treat the negative psychological effects associated with a prolonged stay in your twisted family estate. The second phase, which I call the dungeon phase, is when you pick characters to form a party, buy survival equipment, such as torches, food, and bandages and venture forth into the unknown darkness. Even though the gameplay itself may sound simple enough, keeping your explorers alive and psychologically sound, through endless battles with the undead and the occult will prove to be the toughest challenge in this punishing and unrelenting game.Slick Combat SystemThe combat system is one of the most interesting aspects of the “Darkest Dungeon,” because it blends the physical nature of combat with the mental stress of fighting supernatural creatures. Not only do you have to worry about your explorers getting cut to ribbons, but as the damage mounts your explorers may end up cracking under the pressure and become impossible to control. While the combat system is incredibly addicting and challenging, there are plenty of other features that help to make this game stand out from other strategy role-playing-games.Varying ClassesAnother feature that revolutionizes the role-playing-genre, are the many unique classes that break the mold of the typical healer, tank, and support role. Classes like the “highwayman” who is both a great frontline melee fighter and a crack shot with a flintlock pistol, and the “gravedigger” class who operates from the back of your party but in emergencies can quickly move to the frontline and deliver a killing blow. These are just two examples of a plethora of different classes that will make you think differently about your party composition and how go about slaying the countless horrors of the undead.Quirks and SurvivalOther features that also help to make this game horrendously addictive is the creative quirk system that does an excellent job at giving each character their own unique personality, both positive and negative, which will affect the way a particular character will perform in and out of combat. The survival mechanic feature that is also incorporated in the game definitely adds much needed tension out of combat, by making the player juggle when to consume certain resources, such as food or torches. This resource mini-game truly forces the player to make tough decisions, either to press onward or decide retreating from the dungeon is the better alternative. Even though the “Darkest Dungeon” is definitely well thought-out in terms of its gameplay, the graphics and sound effects also do a great job at helping to convey this dreary and maddening world.The Graphics/Sound EffectsThe graphics in the “Darkest Dungeon” is by far, one the most striking aspects of the game. The two-dimensional world has a very inky, quill like quality that is something, which I have never seen before in my 17-years of playing video games. Along with the creative graphics, the voice acting and sound effects are some of the best I have ever heard. The voice actor that narrates throughout the game is brilliant, which adds a melancholic, storybook quality to the game, and the sound effects, such as the slashing of a sword or the blast of flintlock pistol help to add an extra level of tension and immersion within combat.The Verdict“Darkest Dungeon” is a game that will definitely appeal to anyone who loves creative and original video games. Sure, there will be a few gamers that will complain about the gameplay difficulty or the fact that the level system in the game is a “grind-fest,” but these critiques come down to personal taste of each individual gamer, which is not necessarily a design flaw to be scrutinized. Whether or not you are fan of turn-based-strategy or role-playing-games, I would highly suggest that you at least consider purchasing this brilliant indie title.I give the “Darkest Dungeon” a 10 out of 10.“Some Of The Best Hand-Drawn Artwork I Have Ever Seen”“The Combat Interface Is Intuitive and Extremely Responsive”“When Characters Die and Supplies Run Low, Will You Turn Back?”Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in:You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )You are commenting using your Google+ account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )You are commenting using your Twitter account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )You are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )Connecting to %sNotify me of new comments via email.",

      "I’ve always loved difficult games. From the nail-bitingly complex Dwarf Fortress to The Binding of Isaac to Bloodborne and Furi, there’s nothing quite like the feeling of beating a level, puzzle, or boss, and knowing you overcame a challenge with nothing but skill. Even when things go wrong, and the game seems unfair, you know it was your fault for not taking the proper precautions, reacting slowly or making the wrong decision – and when you eventually pull through, victory is all the sweeter.Today, we’ll be looking on the opposite end of the spectrum – at a game that punishes even the best players and instils a sense of dread and hopelessness in all who lay their hands on it. It’s pretty wonderful.Chris Bourassa, Creative Director and co-founder of Red Hook Studios, describes Darkest Dungeon in grave, yet thrilling terms:‘Darkest Dungeon is a gothic roguelike RPG that explores the stress and trauma that might result from a life spent fighting monsters in long-forgotten tombs, catacombs and other awful places.  Steeped in cosmic horror and occultism, the game challenges players to recruit and manage a roster of heroes, grouping them into parties and sending them out on expeditions to reclaim their family’s estate. Unlike many RPGs, however, the heroes in Darkest Dungeon are human – flawed, and disadvantaged against the legion of supernatural antagonists that they must face.  Combat and exploration take a mental toll on the adventurers and players must manage their roster’s mental as well as physical wellbeing in order to succeed.’My first couple of hours with Darkest Dungeon were a harrowing experience. After an encouraging first expedition into the old, abandoned halls beneath my family manor, I got cocky. If I had enough torches, food, and bandages, I told myself, my tight-knit team of adventurers – and gamer’s intuition – would take care of the rest. I couldn’t have been more wrong. My team was confronted by a group of Lovecraftian cultists hurling eldritch magic – leagues above what my simple Crusader, Highwayman, Vestal (healer), and Plague Doctor were capable of. Though we dispatched the cultists, one of their spells had a permanent effect on my Vestal: she became abusive, throwing insults at her teammates wherever possible, raising their stress and making it easier for them to succumb to Darkest Dungeon’s many Afflictions. Shortly after that, my Highwayman lost all hope, my brave Crusader became a snivelling coward, and my Plague Doctor skulked off to the nearest tavern for a long, hard drink.Oh, well. There’s always more fodder– I mean heroes, arriving by wagon.As you might expect, Darkest Dungeon is famed for its mercilessness, turning against the player on a dime with its hair-trigger Afflictions and ferocious enemies. I asked Chris if he thinks Darkest Dungeon is balanced – i.e. fair to the player – and I really shouldn’t have been surprised by his response:‘Darkest Dungeon has never purported to be fair.  In fact, we go out of our way to tell players that they can expect bad strings of luck, unfortunate events, and general disaster around every corner.  Things are also not always in your control as a player – the game is built on the idea of making meaningful choices with permanent consequences, often with limited or imperfect information.  Darkest Dungeon is how you cope with the unexpected and the unfortunate, and as such, it can never really be ‘balanced’ in the conventional sense of the word.  You will lose a hero or two or five to bad dice rolls, the same way even the most experienced mountain climber can slip and break his leg.  The real question is: how do you deal with it?’The real stars of the show are the poor, tormented Heroes that make up your dungeon-scouring teams. Fresh and eager, they arrive seeking their fortunes – and almost uniformly end up dead, or far worse. Any long-lasting hero owes their success to intense therapy, prayer, drinking, strategy on the player’s part, and lots of luck.I asked Chris about the process of creating a new character class.‘It’s been a little different each time we go to bat.  Most of the time, we’ll first explore what we feel is fertile creative ground, always looking to sidestep mainstream RPG classes, or at least put our spin on them. Leading with the creative has served us well, and often sparks interesting game design discussions.  As the game has matured, however, mechanical opportunities have presented themselves, and we’ve developed outward from that – pairing a hero’s underlying skill mechanics with a strong thematic direction.  In the end, we’re looking for a strong visual, creative and mechanical identity for each of our heroes.  We want them to feel different from one other, and be memorable enough to stand out in a crowd.’Regarding unique characters, Darkest Dungeon has them in spades. While ‘normal’ RPGs tend toward the standard knight, rogue, healer, mage combo, Darkest Dungeon sports Heroes such as the Leper, the Abomination, and the Grave Robber. Over time, you’ll come to love your twisted little party as bad roll after bad roll inflicts them with disease and crippling mental trauma – until, eventually, they are too great a liability to keep around, good for nothing more than suicidal supply runs.It’s refreshing when a game offers a thematic style of play that is – wait for it – a natural result of the game’s systems. You aren’t told to treat new or useless characters like disposable drones to fuel your main party’s later expeditions, but as you learn of Darkest Dungeon’s cruel, merciless nature, you become cruel and merciless.Despite this, a lot of people complain about games that are ‘too difficult’ – Darkest Dungeon, in particular, has received some flak for its random nature, but that’s the point. The game isn’t about constructing an unbeatable team that can crush dungeons with ease, but just barely sustaining yourself against tides of bad luck and character deaths. I think there’s a lot to be said about generic assumptions stopping people from enjoying great games, but instead, I’ll let Chris explain why Darkest Dungeon needs to be punishing.‘It feels good to succeed when the odds are stacked against you!  From the outset, Darkest Dungeon has always been about subverting the power fantasy that exists in many RPGs.  When the game itself is the player’s chief antagonist, beating it can feel incredible.  The lower the lows, the higher the highs – and the more memorable the experience!’I finished by asking Chris for any hints about the future. What is Red Hook doing now? Is a Darkest Dungeon 2 on the horizon?‘We’ve just shipped a smaller DLC – “The Shieldbreaker” – which introduces a new hero to the roster.  Most of our team is now focused on a new, somewhat larger DLC, while a couple of us have started to break ground on our next game.  No details to share just yet, but it’s an exciting time at Red Hook!’Darkest Dungeon is available on Steam, PS4, PS Vita, and the Nintendo Switch.CALENDAR SUBSCRIBE:\nRSS iCalHEAVY is an independent online and print publication for heavy music, movies and related culture. The HEAVY Team are passionate about music and work hard to bring you the latest news, reviews and interviews every day.Thank you for your support.

      "Front page layoutSite themeDarkest Dungeon's first-ever DLC, The Crimson Court, is going to be a hard sell for many players. That's not just a pun on the expansion's extreme difficulty, either, although there is plenty of that here.For those new to the game—and perhaps looking at The Crimson Court as an excuse to hop aboard the crazy train—Darkest Dungeon is a brutal turn-based dungeon crawler. In-game time passes when you send bedraggled squads into the depths of different dungeons. Managing time, resources, and a revolving door of adventurers is a delicate balance that players either learn to walk or bow out of altogether.The Crimson Court DLC isn't self-contained, which presents the expansion's first structural hurdle. You either need to start a new campaign or use an existing save where you don't mind turning that balance inside out with new enemies, objectives, and dangers.That was a pretty tall request for me. I've got a friend or two who have been more than happy to play Darkest Dungeon to completion multiple times since it left Early Access in 2016. I'm not like them. I was plenty happy to beat the grueling game once and walk away. So when I learned that The Crimson Court's addition was more extension than expansion, I was worried I wouldn't be able work up the nerve to commit to the game again from scratch.Maybe I'm more like my friends than I thought. Either that, or the new, vampire-centric Crimson Court is just that tantalizing. Probably both.That's not to say Crimson Court is inviting. The expansion’s new horror begins on week five of a regular Darkest Dungeon campaign, at which point the Hamlet—your home-away-from-horror—is beset by mosquitoes. These literal and figurative buggers put a dent in how much stress your returning spelunkers regain in-town each week. In a game where too much stress can cause your party members to go off the deep end, that's a very frustrating development.The solution is to enter the aptly named Courtyard to burn out the mosquito nests therein. This new zone comprises the bulk of new content specific to The Crimson Court. Of course, you'll want to dive in right away: both to reduce the strain on your employees and to see the new stuff. I recommend waiting, however. Once you pop the seal on the Courtyard, new and potentially devastating enemies start springing up in each and every one of the game's randomly generated levels.That wouldn't be a huge problem, but these new tick- and mosquito-inspired foes can infect your party members with the so-called Crimson Curse. You'll end up spending a lot of time and energy managing the Crimson Curse, a change that fundamentally alters how you think about Darkest Dungeon.The curse is mostly bad. It lowers a given dungeoneer's resistance to just about every negative status effect, reduces their maximum hit points, and increases the chance that they'll go batty when stress gets too high. If that weren't enough, the curse gets worse and worse over time, until the infected adventurer croaks completely. And cursed allies also have a chance of infecting their companions back at the Hamlet.You can only mitigate the curse with the proper application of The Blood, a new resource that drops randomly from enemies. This actually buffs your cursed units for a time. Unfortunately, it also adds a random chance that they might freak out and perform negative actions, much as they would if they'd had a stress breakdown.Mercifully, you can cure the curse. But early in the campaign, curing is only possible by completing missions inside the Courtyard... which requires another random enemy-dropped resource called Invitations.Crimson Court's new enemies, zone, bosses, and hero class (a cross-breed support class and frontliner called the Flagellant, focused on making enemies bleed) are an enormous breath of fresh air. Darkest Dungeon gets plenty of (somewhat deserved) guff for overtaxing its same few areas to support a very long game. The Crimson Court almost sabotages its best feature—more space to play in and around—by stretching out its running time through a reliance on forced loot drops. Basically, a very grindy game got bigger to make the grind less noticeable, but it added more and different grinds on top.I'm conflicted. I have a pretty high tolerance for grinding in games, which goes as far as appreciation in the right circumstances. Vanilla Darkest Dungeon met those circumstances better than nearly any game I've ever played. So much of the game is about taking risks in the short-term and mitigating those risks in the long-term with better gear, soldiers, upgrades, and knowledge. The Crimson Court plays into that risk/reward structure perfectly.But even if the game needs a bit of grinding to work—for those scads of disposable units to turn into a few shining diamonds—the grind itself shouldn't be totally random. Far from it. Darkest Dungeon succeeds largely because, at any given point, you know what kind of danger you're throwing your resources into and what kind of rewards await. Missions warn you in advance how long and difficult they'll be, what kinds of enemies you'll face, and whether or not a boss is waiting for you at the end.Crimson Court's totally random drops on necessary items, like The Blood and Invitations needed to enter the Courtyard, slightly throw off the balance between firmness and fairness.Thankfully, the developers at Red Hook have proven themselves extremely amenable to rebalancing. In fact, The Crimson Court dropped alongside a massive update that changed many existing heroes, added entirely new building mechanics in the Hamlet, and just generally rejiggered the whole experience. Since its release, Red Hook has already bumped up drop rates on The Blood multiple times.Darkest Dungeon has never been a stranger to change. I'm confident that with enough time and tweaking, Red Hook will get its reconfigured concoction just right again. In the meantime, though, The Crimson Court is still a gruesome, enticing infusion for the game. It was enough to rope me back into the madness after I thought I was home free. And I'm very excited to see what comes next.Randomness keeps Darkest Dungeon's signature grind in a holding pattern, but new content breathes life into the whole experience.

    "title": "Enter the Gungeon",
    "text": [
      "Enter the Gungeon is a bullet hell roguelike video game developed by Dodge Roll and published by Devolver Digital. It follows four adventurers as they descend into the Gungeon to find a gun to kill their past. The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 4 on April 5, 2016, on Xbox One on April 5, 2017, as well as on Nintendo Switch on December 14, 2017.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nEnter the Gungeon is a fast-paced bullet hell shooter with roguelike elements, and is therefore often compared to The Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne. The player chooses between the four protagonists, all of whom have different special abilities, such as calling for support or lockpicking chests. A second player is able to join in for co-op mode and control a fifth character. While the player descends the Gungeon, they are set to go through multiple floors, each with a random number of rooms in it. While the rooms are pre-defined, the constellation of rooms in a floor, the enemies that appear in the rooms, and treasure are procedurally generated. Each room contains a set of enemies, which vary in strength, endurance, and attack behaviour, where the attack can range from simple, straightforward shots to a complicated mixture of shots fired at the same time. The player may dodge attacks by performing a dodge roll, which was inspired by the Souls series of video games, and are invulnerable during the action, or alternatively flip tables and use them as covers, although tables can be destroyed if they are shot at. The player has a limited number of \"blanks\" for each floor that can be used to eliminate all current projectiles and temporarily stun enemies. To defeat enemies, the player must use guns, which can be found in chests, won by defeating bosses, or bought at shops scattered around the floors in the Gungeon. The game features over 300 different guns and items that can be combined to achieve more powerful effects. At the end of each floor, a boss awaits the player; beating the boss grants the player a gun or item and currency to spend at shops and unlocks the next floor.As the player progresses through multiple playthroughs, they may encounter non-player characters that can be rescued from the Gungeon. Once rescued, these characters take residence at the Breach, a safe level above the Gungeon, and where the player, prior to starting a new playthrough, can spend a type of in-game currency earned from boss fights to permanently unlock special items that will then have a chance of appearing within the Gungeon for all subsequent playthroughs.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nEnter the Gungeon is set on a distant planet inhabited by living bullets and other strange lifeforms. A gun that could kill the past itself was kept deep within a grim fortress, until a deadly force tore the fortress down and reduced it to ashes. The fortress was rebuilt with the highest of security measures and six adventurers, each with their own stories and regrets, decide to enter the fortress and descend into the Gungeon to seek the legendary gun in order to defeat their own past.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDevelopment on Enter the Gungeon started in 2014, with four Mythic Entertainment employees leaving the company to fulfil their own project just before the company would shut down later that year. According to developer Dave Crooks, he had been listening to the soundtrack to the game Gun Godz by Vlambeer, and the name \"gungeon\" came to him the next day. Crooks presented the name Enter the Gungeon to his fellow team members, and they fleshed out the game's lore over a lunch meeting and then spent the next few weeks to prototype the game mechanics. Though Crooks stated that The Binding of Isaac was one of the game's biggest influences, they also were influenced by Nuclear Throne, Spelunky, Dark Souls and Metal Gear Solid.Dungeons in the game are generated in a procedural manner, but they found it was better to handcraft the individual rooms, playtesting those individually, and then using their random generation to connect these rooms into a dungeon. The designs of the guns took place over the two years of development, with most of the designs by team artist Joe Harty; several of the guns are inspired by other video games and video game systems, including the NES Zapper and guns similar to those appearing in games such as Mega Man, Metroid, Shadow Warrior and Serious Sam. The boss character designs were made by a combination of ideas from Crooks and Harty, which then fed into the gameplay programmer David Rubel to determine appropriate bullet hell patterns associated with that idea.The dodge roll mechanic was inspired by trying to include a similar mechanic of Ikaruga that enabled a player to easily dodge numerous bullets simultaneously, and took the ideas used in the Dark Souls series to have the character dodge out of the way. The team loved this mechanic so much that they opted to name their studio after it. Similarly, they included usable environmental features such as flipping tables or bringing chandeliers down onto enemies to encourage the player to interact with and use the environment to their own advantage. At one point they had included an active reload feature, similar to Gears of War in which pressing a controller button at the right time during a reload would increase the damage the reloaded bullets would do, but instead decided to limit this to a power-up that can be collected, finding that players were already distracted enough by everything else going on in the game and that felt the moment of tension when the player had to wait for the gun to reload was critical to gameplay.Dodge Roll eventually signed a contract with Devolver Digital. In December 2014, at PlayStation Experience, the game was officially announced and followed by an announcement trailer. Throughout 2015, the game went to multiple conventions, including E3 2015, where, during the PC Gaming Show, the co-op feature of the game was revealed. On March 2, 2016, it was announced that the game will release on April 5, 2016. The game is set to receive free post-release content, such as more weapons, enemies, and levels. The first of these, the \"Supply Drop\" update, which adds several new guns, enemies, and room layouts, was released for free on January 26, 2017.A port to the Xbox One, including cross-buy and cross-play support for Windows 10, was released a year later on April 5, 2017; it includes the \"Supply Drop\" expansion. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released in North America and Europe on December 14 and 18, 2017 respectively.A second major update, \"Advanced Gungeons & Draguns\", was released on July 19, 2018 for all platforms, which among additional weapons and enemies, was aimed to provide means to play the game that are friendlier to inexperienced players, but still offer more challenge for others.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nUpon release, Enter the Gungeon received mostly positive reviews, and holds a Metacritic score of 84/100 for PC and one of 82/100 for PlayStation 4. Jed Whitaker of Destructoid rated the game 9.5/10, with praise that the repetitive entering of Gungeon \"never quite feels all that repetitious\", however stating that \"[t]he only part of Gungeon that will surely turn off some people is the difficulty.\" Electronic Gaming Monthly's Spencer Campbell summarizes the game as \"overwhelming\", giving it a score of 9.0/10, however, also decries the difficulty to be too high by saying \"Even though there were a few times that I yearned [] for an easier difficulty [...], Enter the Gungeon's difficulty is actually one of the game's strong points.\" Vince Ingenito from IGN regards the large variety of guns in the game to be especially pleasing, but stating that a few guns are not very original or plain boring, rating the game 8.5/10. For Hardcore Gamer, Kyle LeClair gave Enter the Gungeon a score of 4.5/5, highlighting the game's \"terrific sense of humor, astonishing action, and style and charm oozing out of every corner of its pixelated world\", naming it to be \"[a]n absolute blast at every turn and just pure concentrated fun overall\". The Escapist's Joshua Vanderwall gave the game 3.5/5 stars, criticizing that \"the difficulty often comes from the game refusing to provide you the necessary tools\", also stating that \"[t]he learning curve is very reasonable at first, but there are regular spikes that less proficient players will find incredibly frustrating\".Enter the Gungeon sold more than 200,000 copies within its first week across all platforms, with Steam Spy suggesting that about 75% of these sales were made on Steam. By January 2017, the game has sold more than 800,000 units on all platforms, according to Devolver Digital,\nand reached over one million sales by July 2017.Enter the Gungeon was a financial success on the Switch selling over 75,000 copies in just two weeks and many more to follow after that.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

      "Dave Crooks talks about the foundation of Dodge Roll Games, the creation of Enter the Gungeon, and what their plans are for the game’s future. We also talked about the “Indiepocalypse.”Ian Miles Cheong /\nFeatures /\nDave Crooks, Enter the Gungeon, Interviews, PC, PS4 /Enter the Gungeon is out, and yes, it’s great. The recently released game marries roguelikes and bullet hell mechanics with a charming pixel art aesthetic that’s captured dozens of hours of my time. The game sold more than 200,000 copies in its first three days of release and is by all accounts a bonafide success, allowing the developers to create more content for the game and develop future titles. Dodge Roll Games revealed that the game turned a profit just 8 hours after going live.So I couldn’t turn down the opportunity to interview one of its creators, Dave Crooks, founder and producer at Dodge Roll. We talked about the game at length, how the studio founded and what their plans are for its future. We also talked about the so-called “indiepocalypse,” and how it doesn’t actually exist.Please introduce yourself to our fine readers and tell us a bit about what you do at Dodge Roll Games.Every project requires team work to be accomplished, and by the first impressions of the game, you appear to have found a lot of talent in your studio. Would you mind telling us about the members of your team?You’ve mentioned that most of Dodge Roll Games comes from Mythic. Would you mind going over some of the games your team has created and how their experience played into the development of Enter the Gungeon?Enter the Gungeon is a new take on the dungeon crawler genre, but it feels reminiscent of popular titles like Binding of Isaac. What other titles did your studio draw inspiration from?Every great game needs to have two things: An intriguing story and good game mechanics. You’ve mentioned that Enter the Gungeon’s story is based on Dan Simmons’ Hyperion. As the game is clearly more than just a dungeon crawler, how does the “Gun that can kill the past” play into the characters’ backgrounds? What kind of details can we expect to learn about the four playable characters?Your team has finished the main body of work for Enter the Gungeon, but I understand that you are committed to improving the game constantly to make the experience better. What type of add-ons can we expect to see?Throughout my time with Enter the Gungeon I find myself constantly using the dodge function. How vital do you believe this mechanic is to the player’s survival? And are there other mechanics we can expect to see added to the game?Many dungeon crawlers tend to be single-player adventures. What made Dodge Roll Games create a co-op “bullet-hell” dungeon experience? Do you have any plans to add online co-op?With the time your team has spent developing this game, what would you say was the greatest appeal that Enter the Gungeon has for drawing in new gamers?What would you say was the greatest challenge for you and your team with developing Enter the Gungeon?The “Indiepocalypse” has become something of a hot topic. (For our readers, the “Indiepocalypse” refers to the extinction, or at least diminishing popularity of indie games) What’s your take on the successes and failures of games within the scene? Are some developers just not making games most gamers want to play?What do you think of the Let’s Play scene? How big of an impact do you think streamers and LPs on YouTube have towards the success (or failure) of new, especially indie games?Do you have any words of wisdom for any people out there that wish to become game developers in the future?Thank you for giving us time to interview you and learning more about your studio’s project. What closing thoughts would you wish to leave our readers with?↑",
      "By\nJake Tucker\n2016-04-08T15:56:41.98ZReviewEnter the Gungeon is a good shooter that underdelivers on its promise. It's still fun, but there are better examples of the genre.Enter The Gungeon has a gun fetish. The story revolves around a giant bullet and a gun that can kill the past. Enemies are mostly bullets, the end-of-level lift is a shell casing, the in-game art modelled around gun paraphernalia, Even the health bar models its hearts on bullets.Enter The Gungeon is the latest in a long line of top-down roguelike shooters. It takes its inspiration from genre standouts Nuclear Throne and Binding of Isaac, but also adds many other cool touches to make something that’s a blast to play, even if it doesn’t quite match the highs of its peers.From Binding of Isaac, it borrows the chaotic room-based structure, and the ridiculous boss battle blocking your path to the floors below. From Nuclear Throne, the mass of guns and power-ups, the ridiculous weapons and host of weird and wonderful enemies.It’s one of the hardest top-down shooters I’ve played in a long time. Enemies in the first room are capable of spewing endless rounds your way, and even on the first floor death can come quickly if you get overwhelmed. There's also the bosses which, to a man, are the hardest things I've ever encountered.Gungeon's additions all feel meaningful. Every character has a dodge roll, making you invulnerable to harm while you’re in the air and allowing you to dance between incoming rounds. You can also kick barrels at enemies and flip tables to shield yourself from upcoming fire, allowing you to make yourself a spot of cover in the middle of a shootout.The floors of the dungeon – sorry, gungeon – are a series of hand crafted rooms, meaning you start to recognise slight similarities. It means you can have strategies for certain rooms, and none of the encounters feel truly unfair, even if you might feel like some of your deaths are a bit cheesy.One of the best things about the game is that combat is filled with decisions. Reloading, flipping tables, rolling across the floor. All of these are essential to the flow of combat, and how you use them will determine how successful you are. Many of the weapons also have secondary effects or function that you’ll have to factor into your strategies. One gun gets less powerful as the clip drains, while another alternates between spewing fuel and fire.The real complaint about the game is that, for all of the wonderful guns, power-ups and flow of combat, actually pulling the trigger on most of the guns feels flat. It's disappointing. For a top-down shooter, the fact that shooting feels a bit dull is a big problem, and it’s testament to how good the game feels everywhere else that I’ve enjoyed it regardless.There are four starting characters to choose from, and each has their own strengths. They're not all that different in playstyle, merely starting out with different sets of weapons and passive items, but one of them has a dog, and so became my go-to. Each of these characters has their own reasons for wanting to find the gun that can kill the past, although the narrative isn't terribly important beyond justifying why a bunch of sentient bullets want to murder you.There’s a lot to learn, and most of your information is going to come from within the Ammonomicon, a book which will give you information on everything you’re currently packing, in addition to anything you’ve discovered before. This is good because when you’re picking up weapons like a beehive, a camera or just a bit of tree, it’s invaluable to be able to work out how you’re going to kill folk with it.Over time, when returning to the Breach, you’ll notice it’s slowly evolving as your adventurers fight through the gungeon. Certain characters you find in the depths will return to the Breach and start to offer a variety of services. This gives Gungeon a light metagame to encourage repeated playthroughs, but finding all of the bizarre weaponry is very much its own reward.The loot is so bizarre that it’s a shame how tight-fisted the game is at handing it out. You’ll find new items and power-ups rarely, with a couple of chests per floor, a shop and the boss being the only real way to get the weapons and ammo. Frequently you’ll find yourself stuck with your starter weapons and several times I’ve had to plink at bosses with the starter pistol. Considering a good weapon is the only way to succeed, it can be infuriating.I like Enter the Gungeon a lot, despite it’s numerous little niggles. There’s a lot of depth here for fans of the genre, and importantly, it's a lot of fun. You'll die a bunch, you'll probably rage at a fair few deaths, but you'll keep coming back for more.What is it?

      "I don’t think I’ve ever played a game that manages to be so insanely addictive yet as frustratingly difficult as Enter the Gungeon. Despite countless deaths, frequent self-flagellation for stupid mistakes, and having only made it to level 4 a couple of times, I somehow keep coming back for more and more.Enter the Gungeon is one of the latest in a new breed of rogue-likes. Like the games it draws inspiration from, titles such as Nuclear Throne and The Binding of Isaac, it’s a top-down bullet hell dungeon crawler rendered in cutesy pixel art. Four misfit heroes seeking personal absolution have travelled to a distant planet on a quest for the ultimate treasure: a gun that can kill the past. Held within the bowels of a grim fortress known as the Gungeon, those wishing to wield its power must first do battle with the scores of Gundead that guard it.So you pick a character, head down into the procedurally-generated Gungeon, and blast your way through room and after room of baddies. Clearing the areas earns you bullets that can be spent at a trader that appears in every level. Occasionally you’ll also be rewarded with health and ammo, as well as keys that can be used to open chests. If fortune smiles, you may even happen upon a decent weapon or item. Sooner or later you’ll stumble across the boss lair. Defeat it and you can descend to the next floor, where you’ll encounter more of the same – only this time even harder. Die and you have to start all over again.Enter the Gungeon may not be very original in concept, but it’s rather slick and considered in its execution. And you’ll find it hard not to be won over by the sense of fun and enthusiasm that permeates throughout.The gunfights are frantic and exhilarating. With the music pumping, you burst into each room guns blazing, decorative props smashing all around you while you weave and dodge roll past the throng of oversized projectiles. Better time that dodge roll right though, as you’re only invulnerable during the first half. You can kick over tables to create temporary cover, roll explosive barrels into groups of Gundead, and even drop chandeliers down on their cute little heads. If you’re desperate, you can fire a blank to neutralise all incoming fire. Though you may want to save them for the boss fights. And as you’d hope for in a game like Enter the Gungeon, the controls and movement are smooth and precise, though I definitely preferred the accuracy of a mouse over the slightly better mobility of a gamepad.There are four Gungeoneers to choose from, each favouring a slightly different playstyle and with their own backstory to uncover. The Marine has better accuracy, reloads, and a piece of armour. The Pilot enjoys reduced prices, an extra item slot, and a lockpick. The Convict has a shotgun and a Molotov. The Hunter has a powerful crossbow and a faithful canine companion. They all start with their own unique infinite ammo pistol, but you’ll be hoping to find something with a little more oomph.The Gundead themselves are delightfully silly and gorgeously animated. You’ll encounter gun-toting munitions, suicidal grenades, letter-firing books, bullet-egg laying birds, Pac-Man ghosts with tommy guns, and strange blobs of jelly, to name just a handful. Each pose a unique threat with their own behaviours and firing patterns. And they make such adorable sounds as they die. Bless ‘em.Then there’s the size and wackiness of the Enter the Gungeon’s arsenal. There are 190 unique weapons and around 200 items, each with their own entertainingly daft descriptions, which of course you can read at any time in the preposterously-named Ammonomicon. There’s a demon head that breathes fire, a lowercase “r” that spells out the word “bullet” in bullets, a barrel that shoots slippery fish (nothin’ easier), a mailbox that fires junk mail, and a crate that fires anvils. And yes, some of them are even useful.Visually, it’s like a cross between Hotline Miami and Zelda, and it looks fabulous. The environments are pleasantly varied, colourful, and lavishly adorned. There are courtyards and gardens, tombs, libraries, mines, banquet halls, prisons, and cellars, and they’re all crammed full of cheerfully gun-obsessed paraphernalia. And the attention to detail in the tiny pixelated animations is damn impressive, right down to reflections in puddles and mirrors, food spilling from flipped tables, and all the environmental destruction.But let’s move on to discussing the difficulty. This is a bloody hard game with little margin for error and no easy mode. And no doubt this will put many off. Not only do you have to contend with an incessant hail of bullets as well as off-screen enemies, but there are all manner of traps, pitfalls, and area effects such as fire and poison to be avoided. The various Gundead combine dangerously to produce overlapping bullet formations that can be very difficult to dodge, while rubber bullets attempt to knock you into harm’s way and Blobulons charge you down. And then there are the boss fights, which will really test your mettle. In a game like Enter the Gungeon skill, reflexes, and timing are king, though a modicum of strategy goes a long way. Expect to die a lot, expect to swear a lot.But this is where the real strength of Enter the Gungeon lies. In spite of the excruciating difficulty and the frustration of constantly starting from scratch, you find yourself locked into that “just one more run” mentality. Addictive is not the word. Let’s just say I found myself playing well past my bedtime – oh, very naughty.The randomization is seamless and coherent, so each playthrough feels fresh. There’s a huge variety of environments and room layouts, items and enemy spawns, and several possible bosses for each chamber. There are secret rooms and hidden levels that can appear, and there are usually multiple routes through the map, though it’s definitely worth clearing all the rooms before you attempt the boss, as you never know what you might find. And yes, the Russian roulette of the RNG can make all the difference between a good run and a bad one, but it rarely feels cruel.There’s also a progression system of sorts. From the second chamber onwards you will encounter imprisoned NPCs. Once rescued they’ll begin to populate The Breech (the Gungeon antechamber) or appear randomly in the Gungeon, where they will offer a range of services and side-quests. Eventually, you can even unlock shortcuts that allow you to skip entire floors, while defeating bosses and completing certain tasks rewards you with hegemony credits that can be spent on adding new and better weapons to the RNG pool. Not to mention a tonne of things I’ve still yet to discover. It all contributes to making things just that little bit easier, while adding variety and increasing replayability.Most importantly, you do sense yourself improving with each run. You learn from your mistakes. You gradually familiarize yourself with each of the Gundead, their attack patterns and how to counter them. Your reflexes and tactics get better, and you learn how to use the layouts to your advantage. You also begin to discover the game’s many nuances and secrets, and simple things like saving your keys for the rarer chest types and shooting the common ones open for the chance of receiving a lesser item. There’s certainly a lot more substance and depth to Enter the Gungeon than first meets the eye.In short, Enter the Gungeon is an adorably gun-obsessed dungeon crawler that thrives on its silliness and its over-the-top bullet storm gunfights. It’s slick and well made, the cutesy pixel art is fabulous, and it’s chock full of replay value thanks to its well-implemented procedural generation and a raft of secrets and side-quests. The difficulty may infuriate at times, but the balance is just about right, and persistence and practice are duly rewarded. That said, while its challenging nature will appeal to many, others may be completely put off. There is no easy mode.(A copy of Enter the Gungeon was provided by Kinguin for this review)Developer: Dodge RollPublisher: Devolver DigitalPlatforms: PC, PS4, Mac, LinuxRelease date: 5th April 2016",

      "Enter the Gungeon is a bullet hell rogue like video game developed by Dodge Roll and published by Devolver Digital. It follows four adventurers as they descend into the Gungeon to find a gun to kill their past. Enter the Gungeon was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 4 on April 5, 2016.Enter the Gungeon is set on a distant planet inhabited by living bullets and other strange lifeforms. Your one and only goal is to try to get the gun that can kill the past. Yes, you heard it right! Personally I have not been able to get this gun yet and I will never stop my quest to find it.The dungeon is basically just 4 chambers,  but I haven’t played once where a room was the same after I died. The amount of possible layouts for each chamber is incredible. Furthermore, the number of different guns is impressive.There are more guns that I care to count but I invite you to go and check out the wiki for the gun list! But what I can tell you they are each one funnier than the next I’ve shot letters, bullets, water, fire, ice and even turtles.You start with 4 characters to choose from; the pilot with his handy lock pick, the convict with her lovely Molotov, the hunter with her crossbow and the marine with his armor. There is an extra character when you play the co-op, but I’ll leave you to find out his name.[bctt tweet=”I love this #game. Read the review and watch me play. @DodgeRollGames @devolverdigital @Rizonesoft” username=”TheWhiteNinjaxD”]This is a lovely game. Take a break from all the competitive online games. The first day I played this game I played for 6 hours straight. I just wanted to get to know all the secrets of the game. Take a look at me playing Enter The Gungeon below.I would recommend this game to anyone that loves fast pace dogging and shooting or anyone that just wants to have some fun. In conclusion, this game can also be played in local multiplayer, hopefully someday there will be an online multiplayer. Alone this game is fun, but playing with your best friend would be next level.This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

      "Enter the Gungeon’s design is quite sophisticated for a game about shooting bullets at anthropomorphized bullets with guns; it uses elements of one genre in the context of another, enhancing its most enjoyable elements. Despite there being so many more moving parts than in a typical arcade shooter, it somehow feels more immediate and focused on getting you into the action and keeping you there.Its flaws elsewhere are all the more disappointing. So much care is apparent in its construction, but in its attempt to merge multiple genres and styles together, Enter the Gungeon’s most important elements--namely its roguelike flavors and massive offering of distinct weapons--don’t gel. It’s a game at odds with itself.As it’s a superb shooter with a terrific sense of humor, astonishing action, and style and charm oozing out of every corner of its pixelated world. An absolute blast at every turn and just pure concentrated fun overall, Enter the Gungeon is an absolute gem that is not to be missed out on and Dodge Roll should be congratulated for it. Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to go back and hunt for that shark-launching gun…Enter the Gungeon is a fast paced dungeon shooter that punishes and rewards in equal measure. Easy to get into, and tough as nails when it wants to be, Dodge Roll’s energetic and hilarious loot ’em up is sometimes frustrating, but more often a joy to experience. Packed with hidden extras, a boatload of preposterous weapons, and some of the most delightful enemies you could hope to murder, this is a must for any fan of the roguelike-like design model.I’m not going to pretend that Enter the Gungeon is for everybody, it’s not. If players can’t stand the idea of starting over from scratch mostly after each death or don’t have an appreciation for games like Binding of Isaac, there isn’t much to change their minds here. Though players looking for something more in that spirit with different gameplay mechanics that mostly come away feeling all for the better, they are in for a treat.=Like with the loot system and item drops, the flaws in co-op aren't fatal, but they do detract from what is, in places, an accomplished roguelike with a lot going for it, and a few hours play will see shortcuts open and more powerful – and more satisfying – guns drop a bit more often. Besides, the pun works. Just.Enter the Gungeon is one of the most polished games I’ve ever played, especially considering the multitude of items that are available. Just when I thought that the rogue-like genre had been done to death, this game comes along and completely turns me around. I’m not sure I’ll ever master the Gungeon, but I’m not sure if I’ll ever want to leave, either.Its razor sharp twin-stick gunplay, huge variety of passive and active weapons, and clever world building make it an absolute joy to sink countless hours into. The lack of leaderboards or a daily run mode is a frustrating oversight, but you'll be too busy running, gunning, and dodge-rolling your way through its many caverns to notice or care.Enter The Dungeon is a great meld of two very complimentary genres. The pixel art is great and there’s a fun sense of humour that permeates throughout the game. But it’s also filled with neat touches, such as automatically levitating collectables towards you when you clear a room, that help to make it as accessible and non-frustrating as possible.Every gun is still fun to use, even down to the simplest of pistols, but there’s a noticeable familiarity between many of them that makes switching between them less impactful than you’d hope for in an arcade shooter. Still, with all those map layouts and bosses to hunt down, you’ll still spend hours in the Gungeon pushing yourself, with a stupid, maniacal grin on your face.There's just so much to admire here, from the brilliantly reactive environments, to the quirky enemies and the healthy selection of guns; it's easy to appreciate the attention to detail that has gone into every facet of the game. Enter the Gungeon is a well-crafted and moreish mash-up of bullethell action and roguelike mechanics, and fans of both genres will find plenty to enjoy in this delightfully constructed twin-stick shooter.A toweringly charismatic twin-stick blaster that expertly marries retro shooter beats with roguelike game mechanics, Enter the Gungeon is one of the cleverest and most enjoyable shooters money can buy.And as fun and funny as Enter the Gungeon is, it is certainly intense. One 20 minute run can feel like an hour of peaks and valleys, and if you lose concentration for a second you’ll pay the price. But it’s a great game, and the difficulty shouldn’t be off-putting: I’m famously terrible at games and I’m slowly crawling to the finish. I strongly suggest you do the same.Enter the Gungeon es un título pensado especialmente para los amantes del género indie y de los grandes retos. Su alta dificultad y su apartado visual puede echar para atrás a más de uno, pero los más valientes sabrán apreciar el valor de estos elementos. Eso sí, no esperéis encontrar una gran historia tras Enter the Gungeon ni un sistema de combate complejo porque Devolver Digital y Dodge Roll nos ofrecen un título cargado de acción ideal para jugar partidas rápidas de entre 5 y 15 minutos de media.Enter the Gungeon es un rogue-like enfocado a la acción que proporcionará cientos de hora de diversión a aquellos que se dejen atrapar por sus innumerables trucos, y es que a la recolección de cada una de las armas y objetos, el frenesí de los tiroteos, la exquisitez del control y un magnífico trabajo de diseño que simula -en 3D- un pixel art muy preciso, se le une un trabajo artístico de primer nivel y lo más importante: rejugabilidad, diversión y capacidad para enganchar por encima de toda duda.Enter the Gungeon es un dungeon crawler de disparos divertidísimo, completo y adictivo. Tiene un sistema de progresión muy acertado, pequeños ajustes en su jugabilidad que lo hacen diferenciarse de sus competidores, y, además, un cooperativo de esos que pueden romper amistades o forjarlas para siempre. No creemos que vaya a revolucionar el género ni la industria, pero si os gustan este tipo de juegos, Enter the Gungeon es una opción segura.Teníamos muchas ganas de disfrutar de esta nueva producción de Devolver Digital y Dodge Roll. Y no nos ha decepcionado. Echamos en falta modo online y, quizá, alguna opción adicional, pero este dungeon crawler presenta la suficiente calidad y entidad como para destacar dentro de su género, muy manido últimamente, ofreciendo unas dosis de acción tan elevadas como atractivas y un nivel de desafío tan exigente como atractivo.Das Ballern macht Spaß und fühlt sich dank punktgenauer Steuerung und akkurater Kollisionsabfrage einfach nur klasse an. Die zufällig generierten Abschnitte, bei denen man von Hand gebaute und mit Gegnern konfigurierte Zimmer zu ständig neuen Herausforderungen zusammensetzt, können ebenfalls überzeugen - auch wenn der Schwierigkeitsgrad durchaus happig ist. Doch im Gegenzug wird man bei jedem frischen Anlauf mit einer neuen Entdeckung belohntEnter the Gungeon macht nichts neu und eigentlich auch nichts einzigartig. Trotzdem konnte ich mich nur schwer vom Spiel lösen. Denn der Titel konzentriert sich aufs Wesentliche und entwickelt einen hypnotischen Sog. Die einzige Kritik am Spiel ist gleichzeitig ein Pluspunkt: Enter the Gungeon ist ein unterhaltsamer Twinstick-Rogue-like-Shooter, nur ist es eben nie mehr als das.Malheureusement le jeu manque d’être vraiment très bon en ne soignant pas suffisamment le son de ses armes, la lisibilité de l’action ou la compréhension de l'arsenal. Ces défauts ne sont pas suffisamment marqués pour réellement vous empêcher de passer un bon moment, mais empêchent tout de même le jeu de réellement tutoyer le haut du panier. Mais si vous cherchez un titre plaisant, où l’objectif est de tirer sur tout ce qui bouge, le contrat est rempli.Il risultato è così un cocktail goduriosamente esplosivo, una miscela in grado di inebriare come poche altre quei palati fini alla ricerca di una sfida arcade quasi indomabile. Si astengano invece senza riserve gli impazienti, quelli che amano la pappa pronta e chi non è abituato a sudarsi le proverbiali sette camicie prima di arrivare alla meta.Enter the Gungeon – это отличная точка входа для тех, кто хочет испытать себя в жанре интерактивного садомазо, с плетками, но без прищепок на соски в виде беспощадной Dark Souls 3. Если соскучились по «Айзеку» и сложностям вообще, обязательно попробуйте, игра того стоит.",
      "All aboard the bullet train!Developer: Dodge Roll\nPublisher: Devolver Digital\nFormat: PC, PS4 (reviewed)\nReleased: April 5, 2016\nCopy purchasedEnter The Gungeon could be easily dismissed as yet another pixel-peddling dungeon crawler with obligatory “roguelike elements.” Such games are a dime a dozen these days, and it’s not hard to see why – while most of them are trash, the truly brilliant ones are stellar experiences that become cult smash successes.Make no mistake, Dodge Roll’s pun-laden bullet bazaar is an example of a brilliant one.The titular Gungeon is a subterranean vault of gun worship where troubled warriors can attempt to rewrite their histories and undo wrongs. Filled to the brim with monsters and weaponry, it’s a dangerous place, and players will go up against huge bosses, bullet hell gunfire, and a range of deadly traps as one of four heroes.Each playable character has its own starting weapon, passive skill, and special item. The Pilot, for example, has a bobby pin for a chance to unlock chests without a key, while the Marine wears a helmet that takes a free hit for him. The Convict carries a sawn-off shotgun and molotov cocktails, and the Hunter owns a dog that picks up items for her. Each character ostensibly plays the same way, but the extra items can make big differences in an early game.The Gungeon itself is a harsh environment. Each randomly generated room is host to a number of aggressive enemies, almost all of them gun themed. The stock opponents are cute little bullets shaped like the ammo of the guns they’re holding, though you’ll also find ghosts with tommy guns, books that fire bullets arranged like letters, and walking grenades.Among others. Lots of others.Each firefight is intense as bullets fly in from all corners. Tables can be kicked over to provide temporary cover, and a crucial dodge roll allows players to leap over the incoming fire. Timing one’s dodges, using environmental traps like falling chandeliers, and making use of walls or pitfalls are just as important as shooting at the monsters.Less forgiving than the easily comparable Binding of Isaac, Enter the Gungeon drops health very rarely, so taking a hit is brutal. Each floor of the Gungeon has a shop where armor, health, and weaponry can be purchased, but it can get quite pricey and the amount of cash you earn from felled enemies relies on luck.Luck is a hallmark of any good quasi-roguelike, and Gungeon has a huge range of weapons and equippable items to facilitate chance’s influence.As one might reasonably expect, the amount of guns on offer are vast and often hilarious. Such weapons include a trident that shoots long-range energy bolts through multiple targets, an NES lightgun that spawns aggressive pixelated ducks, and a magic pistol that randomly turns foes into chickens.There are loads of more traditional armaments like revolvers, shotguns, and machine guns, but they often play second fiddle to the more exotic items on offer. There are plenty of pop culture references, too – guns based on Warhammer 40,000, Blade Runner, even Looper can be uncovered, and it’ll take a long time to find them all.Like The Binding of Isaac, you’ll have good runs and bad runs. On a good day, expect to find immensely powerful guns, health upgrades, and cool sub-items. On a bad day, you might get little more than a bow n’ arrow or a bunch of locked chests without keys. Even the bad runs can be fun, however, because the fast pace of combat and neverending stream of silly visuals is a reward unto itself.I will say, however, the game could maybe stand to be a tad more generous. Maybe I’m just spoiled by Isaac, but the stinginess with cash and health can make the game really quite brutal at times, especially if you’re unlucky enough to get a sequence of tough rooms with little respite in between. There’s no guarantee you’ll be able to find better than your dinky starting gun before facing the floor’s boss, either.Speaking of bosses, they’re bloody fantastic. These intense encounters bar your way to the next floor, and they’re punny as hell. Such aggressors include the Gatling Gull, the Beholster, and the Cannonbalrog, each one uniquely designed to spew hundreds of bullets in wild patterns and pull off a range of nasty tricks.Fortunately, you get two “blanks” on each floor which can be used to instantly eradicate every bullet in the room. Use them wisely – they can be absolute lifesavers.In addition to all the top-down blasting, there are tons of secrets to discover. Hidden areas are yours for the finding, strange devices will take your guns and items in exchange for things, and non-player characters regularly turn up in cells. Finding a cell key and freeing them will have benefits in future runs – you might discover a new merchant to buy from, or someone who’ll offer special challenges in certain rooms.A unique currency, dropped only from bosses, is used in the Breach – Enter the Gungeon‘s hub world – to unlock new weapons to randomly appear in the game.In short, even when you’ve cleared a run through the Gungeon, there is plenty – plenty – of stuff to discover.Dodge Roll has absolutely nailed the addictive “one more go” quality that is crucial to a game like this. With death capable of occurring at any moment, it’s important to keep players hooked, and the game’s vast range of secrets and wacky loot keeps me coming back for another round.The shooting itself is rock solid and entertainingly hectic. Dodging is highly responsive, each weapon feels markedly different to use, and there’s something incredibly fun about kicking over tables to avoid enemy fire at the last second.That said, I really, really wish guns would autoreload. In the middle of a heavy firefight, it can be supremely irritating to have to manually hit the reload button (or remove and replace your finger on the trigger) to keep the bullets going. This isn’t so much of an issue with guns you’re manually firing, but automatic weapons suffer a lot.One of the most endearing qualities of Enter the Gungeon is its commitment to detail. Each enemy is cleverly designed to be both cool and adorable, and the environments are littered with extraneous elements that most “retro” looking games skimp on. Some tables have fruit bowls or books on them that scatter when kicked over, each room is full of furniture that gets shattered during combat, and the walls are filled with fun posters and paintings.In an era where “retro indie” is a tired and overused look, Gungeon‘s highly detailed environments and delightful creature designs make it stand out as something special.Backing up the excellent graphics is a soundtrack to die for. The music is suitably pumping and can bury itself into your brain with alarming ease. It gets intense when it needs to, and triumphant at the appropriate times.Enter the Gungeon is a fast paced dungeon shooter that punishes and rewards in equal measure. Easy to get into, and tough as nails when it wants to be, Dodge Roll’s energetic and hilarious loot ’em up is sometimes frustrating, but more often a joy to experience.Packed with hidden extras, a boatload of preposterous weapons, and some of the most delightful enemies you could hope to murder, this is a must for any fan of the roguelike-like design model.It has bullets that fire guns at you. I mean, that’s good enough for any game, right?9.5/10\nSuperbI like binding of isaac but this game is too hard for me. I don’t like playing a game for 7 hours and not even beating the second level. I don’t think it’s just that I’m not good at video games I think that they’ve made the game too hard without much reward. I’m trying to build a shortcut but even that is really hard and luck based to do. This game in my opinion is nothing compared to the great games like ftl and binding of isaac.Loving this game. It scratches the same sort of gameplay itch that Binding of Isaac does for me in a way that is just different enough to feel complimentary instead of derivative. It does something that I see very rarely in games these days, but actually quite adore in that it actually gives you an in universe encyclopedia that fills out as you find more guns and kill more enemies, almost always with a nice little bit of flavorful description. It brings me right back to my childhood where the first thing I’d do after getting a new game is… Read more »Never managed to get into Binding of Isaac or similar games but am hooked on this one.\nThe soundtrack is alright I guess. I’d maybe piss on it if it was on fire but can’t say I’d be compelled to sacrifice my life for it.Gungeon Keeper Mobile, wherein you have to wait 1 hour to reload a gun, or pay $5.00 to reload it instantly.Great game.And yet again, our glorious profits’ words ring true. For did he not mention, offhandedly in his Binding of Isaac list, that one day there would be an Isaac with a bald space-marine and guns?I’m not at all sure I buy the idea that luck is a major hallmark of any good- well, anything, frankly. I’m very, very tired of feeling like my skill, whether tremendous or lacking, is running up against a bad roll of the dice; that I *could* have made it all the way, but the random number generator just didn’t come up with that last cherry this time. So sorry, mark; next time you’re sure to win the kewpie doll. Even the board and card games I favor these days offer players some measure of a way to offset their… Read more »So cool to see a small game get s good score.This sort of game goes is so at home on the Vita… but at this stage of its life it might be too much to hope it’ll get a port 🙁*Cries in xboxian*Will it come out for the xbone? I hooope soI found a gun randomly that was just “a lower case r.” When I fired it, it shot the word “bullet” in a stream of semi-automatic fire, each shot accompanied by a strange voice saying “bullet” with highly deliberate enunciation.The delight I felt from that discovery is worth the price of admission alone.I really wish I could get into rogue likes fully. I played Spelunky and Rogue Legacy, and even though I put in loads of hours, I never felt I was progressing. Then I also tried the binding of issac, but still haven’t felt it click.It’s strange because I really like the concept.they’ve done a cracker but I do wonder will this be free on PS Plus 5 months from now ? Strange thing is I didn’t like the PS4 version of Binding of Issac but I really liked the PC version… so I may just buy the PC version and play it in window mode and end up doing bugger all work.Can we come up with a new genre name for “roguelike”?Nicely put Jim. Also, you should check out Stories: The Path of Destinies when you get a chance. It’s soooo good.I’ve been playing this and enjoying it a ton, but I find the character balance to be a bit off. In my experience, the Marine is by far the best character, due to his starting gun having the largest clip size of the four (and possibly range? not quite positive on that, but I think it at least has more range than the Pilot’s) and, more importantly, his passive which increases his accuracy (and also reload speed). You can blaze through rooms on the first floor, taking out 3 enemies with a single clip, while characters like the Convict (who… Read more »I watched your Squirty Play for this, Jim, and it looks amazing.

You pointed out game’s problems that are more of annoyances. I didn’t find lack of auto reload a problem because I got used to tap right bumper. Even with automatic guns. I can see that may be an inconvenience though. I do however agree that loot drop may be slightly better, however devs are already working on it and seem to be aware of the problem. I have played 8h total so far and I can’t wait to get home to play more. The game requires skill and rewards if you learn. Died 20 times but I… Read more »I took a look at the wiki to see all the playable characters (including secret unlocks) and decided to wait for some updates. i gotta have an avatar i like to play a game like this.Reminds me a little bit of shoot that many robots and spelunky, love both games so i will get this eventually, hope it does receive a retail physical release, though.I love all the secret stuff I’ve been finding in this. Figured out how to get to the Oubliette earlier and working on getting the lift to the second floor open for business, although it’s demands are a bit rough. Such a good game. Would like an easier mode, the ability to dive over tables and a bit more generosity with loot/money but otherwise, it’s a damn fine game.Picked it up on a whim. It’s unforgiving in the extreme, but damn it I’m a satisfied customer. Great for when Isaac doesn’t feel challenging any more.",

Just download torrent and start playing it.Enter the Gungeon Download Free Full Game is a bullet hell roguelike video game developed by Dodge Roll and published by Devolver Digital. It follows four adventurers as they descend into the Gungeon to find a gun to kill their past. The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 4 on April 5, 2016.GameplayEnter the Gungeon is a fast-paced bullet hell shooter with roguelike elements, and is therefore often compared to The Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne. The player chooses between the four protagonists, all who have different special abilities, such as calling for support or lockpicking chests. A second player is able to join in for co-op mode and control a fifth character. While the player descends the Gungeon, they are set to go through multiple floors, each with a random number of rooms in it. While the rooms are pre-defined, the constellation of rooms in a floor is procedurally generated. Each room contains a set of enemies, which vary in strength, endurance, and attack behaviour, where the attack can range from simple, straightforward shots to a complicated mixture of shots fired at the same time. Enter the Gungeon Free Download.The player may dodge attacks by performing a dodge roll, which was inspired by the Souls series of video games, and are invulnerable during the action, or alternatively flip tables and use them as covers, although tables can be destroyed if they are shot at. The player has a limited number of «blanks» for each floor that can be used to eliminate all current projectiles and temporarily stun enemies. To defeat enemies, the player must use guns, which can be found in chests, won by defeating bosses, or bought at shops scattered around the floors in the Gungeon. The game features over 200 different guns and items that can be combined to achieve more powerful effects. At the end of each floor, a boss awaits the player; beating the boss grants the player currency to spend at shops and unlocks the next floor.As the player progresses through multiple playthroughs, they may encounter non-player characters that can be rescued from the Gungeon. Once rescued, these characters take residence at the Breach, a safe level above the Gungeon, and where the player, prior to starting a new playthrough, can spend a type of in-game currency earned from boss fights to permanently unlock special items that will then have a chance of appearing within the Gungeon for all subsequent playthroughs.PlotEnter the Gungeon is set on a distant planet inhabited by living bullets and other strange lifeforms. A gun that could kill the past itself was kept deep within a grim fortress, until a deadly force tore the fortress down and brought it to ashes. The fortress was rebuilt with the highest of security measures and four adventurers, each with their own stories and regrets, decide to enter the fortress and descend into the Gungeon to seek the legendary gun in order to defeat their own past. Enter the Gungeon Free Download PC Game.DevelopmentDevelopment on Enter the Gungeon started in 2014, with four Mythic Entertainment employees leaving the company to fullfil their own project just before the company would shut down later that year. According to developer Dave Crooks, he had been listening to the soundtrack to the game Gun Godz by Vlambeer, and the name «gungeon» came to him the next day. Crooks presented the name Enter the Gungeon to his fellow team members, and they fleshed out the game's lore over a lunch meeting and then spent the next few weeks to prototype the game mechanics. Though Crooks stated that The Binding of Isaac was one of the game's biggest influences, they also were influenced by Nuclear Throne, Spelunky, Dark Souls and Metal Gear Solid.Dungeons in the game are generated in a procedural manner, but they found it was better to handcraft the individual rooms, playtesting those individually, and then using their random generation to connect these rooms into a dungeon. The designs of the guns took place over the two years of development, with most of the designs by team artist Joe Harty; several of the guns are inspired by other video games and video game systems, including the NES Zapper and guns similar to those appearing in games such as Mega Man, Metroid, Shadow Warrior and Serious Sam. The boss character designs were made by a combination of ideas from Crooks and Harty, which then fed into the gameplay programmer David Rubel to determine appropriate bullet hell patterns associated with that idea. Enter the Gungeon for PC.The dodge roll mechanic was inspired by trying to include a similar mechanic of Ikaruga that enabled a player to easily dodge numerous bullets simultaneously, and took the ideas used in the Dark Souls series to have the character dodge out of the way. The team loved this mechanic so much that they opted to name their studio after it. Similarly, they included usable environmental features such as flipping tables or bringing chandeliers down onto enemies to encourage the player to interact with and use the environment to their own advantage. At one point they had included an active reload feature, similar to Gears of War in which pressing a controller button at the right time during a reload would increase the damage the reloaded bullets would do, but instead decided to limit this to a power-up that can be collected, finding that players were already distracted enough by everything else going on in the game and that felt the moment of tension when the player had to wait for the gun to reload was critical to gameplay.Dodge Roll eventually signed a contract with Devolver Digital. In December 2014, at PlayStation Experience, the game was officially announced and followed by an announcement trailer. Throughout 2015, the game went to multiple conventions, including E3 2015, where, during the PC Gaming Show, the co-op feature of the game was revealed. On March 2, 2016, it was announced that the game will release on April 5, 2016. The game is set to receive free post-release content, such as more weapons, enemies, and levels.ReceptionUpon release, Enter the Gungeon received mostly positive reviews, and holds a Metacritic score of 84/100 for PC and one of 82/100 for PlayStation 4. Jed Whitaker of Destructoid rated the game 9.5/10, with praise that the repetitive entering of Gungeon «never quite feels all that repetitious», however stating that [t]«he only part of Gungeon that will surely turn off some people is the difficulty.» Electronic Gaming Monthly's Spencer Campbell summarizes the game as «overwhelming», giving it a score of 9.0/10, however, also decries the difficulty to be too high by saying «Even though there were a few times that I yearned [] for an easier difficulty [...], Enter the Gungeon's difficulty is actually one of the game's strong points.» Vince Ingenito from IGN regards the large variety of guns in the game to be especially pleasing, but stating that a few guns are not very original or plain boring, rating the game 8.5/10. For Hardcore Gamer, Kyle LeClair gave Enter the Gungeon a score of 4.5/5, highlighting the game's «terrific sense of humor, astonishing action, and style and charm oozing out of every corner of its pixelated world», naming it to be [a]«n absolute blast at every turn and just pure concentrated fun overall». The Escapist's Joshua Vanderwall gave the game 3.5/5 stars, criticizing that «the difficulty often comes from the game refusing to provide you the necessary tools», also stating that [t]«he learning curve is very reasonable at first, but there are regular spikes that less proficient players will find incredibly frustrating».Enter the Gungeon sold more than 200,000 copies within its first week across all platforms, with Steam Spy suggesting that about 75% of these sales were made on Steam.

      "Home » Linux Gaming News » The Incredible Story of BetaDwarf and ForcedThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.Oct. 24, 2013, is not only the release date of indie gem Forced, by Denmark-based developer BetaDwarf; it is also the culmination of an incredible, nearly three-year-long story surrounding the development of the game, featuring overwhelming passion, the amazing power of social media, and a just little bit of trespassing on university property.BetaDwarf got its start at Aalborg University in Denmark, where Steffen Kabbelgaard and Kenneth Harder worked as teacher’s assistants. Both Kabbelgaard and Harder had delved a bit into game development in the past — working on a game called Armies vs. Champions, which has since been shelved — but they realized that if they truly wanted to get into the industry, they needed a team. Fortunately, their positions as TAs in animation and programming classes gave them the opportunity to know the brightest minds in the curriculum.So one day, the pair decided to invite some of those students to a secret presentation of the game that would eventually become Forced. A team of nine was formed, and BetaDwarf was born.\nWorking for the university had another perk as well: During summer vacation, Kabbelgaard realized that the classrooms were completely empty and that no one visited them.“We slowly moved in bits into a big classroom and before we knew it, we were suddenly living there,” said Kabblegaard. “We literally moved everything we had. We had eight big beds, microwaves, refrigerators. We had no reason not to live there because there were bathrooms and even a gym there.”The team stayed in the room for seven months, well past the duration of summer vacation. Some teachers were willing to look the other way, but eventually, word got out. This put the university in a bit of a tough situation, Kabblegaard said. On one hand, the university was extremely proud of what the team had accomplished with the game. But of course, on the other hand, trespassing is a serious offense.“They had a double-edged sword because they wanted to befriend us for the future as well, but they were not that okay with us being there illegally,” Kabblegaard said.Ultimately, the school offered BetaDwarf a room to work in, but it was too small for the team, and they were forced to pack up and hit the road. This put BetaDwarf in a bit of a crisis. The company had no office, several of its team members had cancelled their housing arrangements and leases in favor of living in the university, and the game was still nowhere near to being ready for release.You must be logged in to post a comment.Subscribe to Linux Game Consortium and receive notifications of new posts by email.",

      "When I first booted up Forced Showdown I wasn’t too sure what I was playing. Is this a brawler? Why do I have decks of cards? Am I on some game show? Forced Showdown is a twin stick shooter/brawler where you play one of four contestants on the Galactic Game Show for the amusement of billions of viewers. You must fight your way through hordes of enemies to reach the showdown with the boss of each contest. The game’s theme and humour are reminiscent of the Borderlands series in that quirky, dark kind of way. Luckily the aesthetic and dialogue keep you in a good mood because the game starts out a little frustrating; however, once you finally piece together all of the concepts and strategies the game borrows from other genres you’ll quickly become a crowd favorite on the Galactic Game Show.At its core Forced Showdown is a twin stick shooter but incorporates elements from several other genres to keep things interesting. Each playable contestant on this grizzly gameshow has a basic attack and three abilities, one of which might be a passive. Each of these characters has a unique enough playstyle and card set to be able to build different strategies around each. I found myself wanting to switch back and forth between contestants until I found that perfect combination of abilities and cards that fit my playstyle which I consider a plus.______________________________Once you select a contestant you start your long journey through the game show. In order to proceed through the stages you must clear two out of four rounds. These rounds will have a randomly selected boss and an active effect. Sometimes these effects will actually help you out but are balanced by adding more enemies while others will result in debuffs to your character with the especially difficult debuffs reducing the number of enemies. After completing two of these rounds, you must fight the guardian of the gate that leads to the next section and repeat this process until reaching the final boss, all the while collecting points to purchase boons, effects that are persistent to your character or companion for the rest of your current run (think mutations from Nuclear Throne).The arena battles for each round are reminiscent of the old Gauntlet games with much smaller maps. At the beginning of each round you draw from your deck and choose which cards to play. Each card has an associated mana cost and each round you gain one more mana to add to your pool.  It would take another several hundred words to describe all the intricacies of the types of cards you can have in your deck, but they are essentially buffs or consumables you can use for the remainder of the round (until you beat the boss and are teleported back to the main hall). I found this to be one of the greatest strengths in this game. Depending on what type of enemies I would encounter in the round or what active curse was in effect I could choose the effect I wanted and when, leading to some interesting strategies on the fly. I love that feeling of drawing into the exact card you need at the exact moment you need it and pulling out a win because now you have that extra bit of healing or that extra bit of damage. This type of gameplay is great for the longevity of the game and keeps every run fresh.Similar to the playable contestants, there are 3 companions you can unlock and choose to accompany you through the arenas. I didn’t find these too useful heading into the later levels; I considered them more of a temporary agro shield since they die fairly quickly to bosses and elite mobs. It is possible to buff your companions with cards from your deck or with boons so there might be a viable strategy for these guys yet.On the topic of cards, the basic deck the game provides for each contestant is actually pretty decent. I would strongly recommend using it for a few playthroughs to get a good feeling for what the strength of each contestant is and from there tweak the basic deck with cards you win from the fortune spinner. Currently there is not an option to craft a specific card, but there is a mechanic for deconstructing cards that you have more than two of (decks have a limit to two of the same card) into a currency that can be recycled to get a random card of a particular rarity. I would like the ability to spend a bit more of the crystals to get a specific card, but I will give credit for the ability to recycle unwanted duplicates.As a whole the game plays really well. It somehow pulls off the incorporation of elements from so many different genres surprisingly well. Unfortunately, the battle mechanics seem a little unpolished. Some arena stages devolve into a chaotic mess of explosions and shots from across the map. I don’t have a problem with the chaos and taking some heavy damage, but there isn’t a reliable form of healing in between arenas. If you don’t draw health buffs or healing, you are in for a real difficult time with the levels that constantly explode. I will concede that some of those explosions are avoidable but one boss in particular left me with a bad taste: the snake boss. This boss has one particular move where he charges you wherever you are. There is little to no telegraphing of this move, especially when you are off screen. I’m sorry, but I can’t stand dying from enemies that charge or teleport from off-screen with no telegraph (looking at you Rakanoth from Diablo 3).I think Forced Showdown has done a great job of incorporating different strategic layers on top of a twin stick shooter. The random effects on each level combined with the meta card game style of buffs keeps the game interesting while you are grinding out the unlocks and competing in daily runs. I can see myself sinking many hours into this game just to get the perfect deck to take me to the top of the leaderboards.*** PC Code provided by the publisher ***amzn_assoc_placement = \"adunit0\";\namzn_assoc_enable_interest_ads = \"true\";\namzn_assoc_tracking_id = \"cogc-20\";\namzn_assoc_ad_mode = \"auto\";\namzn_assoc_ad_type = \"smart\";\namzn_assoc_marketplace = \"amazon\";\namzn_assoc_region = \"US\";\namzn_assoc_linkid = \"733522eb2486c367935d47a0c4238bfb\";\namzn_assoc_emphasize_categories = \"13900871,172282,979455011,165793011,468642\";Developer: BetaDwarfPublisher: BetaDwarf",
      "You Are Not Logged In!( Sign-Up | Log-In )Hello everyone, it is time for another review and this time I am really honored and sooo excited to present you Forced Showdown. Forced Showdown is an action and deckbuilding game  combined in a Galactic Game Show - but questions are replaced by deadly Gladiator Battles! You are the contestant - will you die or become a crowd favorite? The game is created and published by BetaDwarf and it got released on the 29th of March.Itâ€™s also the only Galactic Game Show with lives on the line and we can describe it as Twin-stick, Deck-building, and Rogue-lite title. To begin with the very first aspect of the game that I loved is definitely the great graphics. They are really high on details, the world and the lobby of the game is really amazing and fun to walk around. I also liked that each time you start a new battle/show the world you enter is random and the enemies as well. This feature enhances the whole replay value of the title because every challenge will be different and harder every time you start them. Moreover, the cards in the game are used in a really smart way and they create a different atmosphere in it and escape the classic twin-stick and deck-building games we have all got used to.The artwork in them is impressive as well. Moreover, another positive aspect of the game is that you really feel that you are in a show with the announcer and when every new round starts itâ€™s like you are in a new battle with more enemies or bigger disadvantages. This game requires not a lot of skill but a great amount of luck...so prepare to die a lot and restart your battles even more times. There are also a lot of ways to get new cards and there different modes in the as well and different chapters to explore.As far as the negative aspects are concerned, personally there isnâ€™t much negative stuff to mention but if I had to mention one it would definitely be the fact that the game is too random. There will be many times that you will have to restart the title because the cards you got are not useful at all or because the conditions of the battle are not the ones you like!To sum up, the game is definitely worth picking it up even at its full price because it offers a complete experience that will satisfy even the most demanding gamers. Great job BetaDwarf!Verdict: 9/10 +graphics+random generated aspect+artwork and use of cards+atmosphere-too random at some times  Dionysis SpinosCopyright © 2018 by ELECTRONICSGAMES LLChosted by dreamhost.com"

      "In video games and pixel art, \"isometric\" refers to some form of axonometric projection (commonly, the form of dimetric projection with a 2:1 pixel ratio) where the viewpoint is angled to reveal other facets of the game environment than are typically visible from a purely top-down perspective or side view, thereby producing a three-dimensional effect. In almost all cases, however, the term \"isometric\" is misapplied; in true isometric projection, the representations of the x, y and z axes are strictly oriented 120° to each other, whereas in other projections the angles vary. The terms \"3/4 perspective\", \"2.5D\" and \"pseudo-3D\" are also frequently applied, though these terms can possess slightly different meanings in different contexts.Once common, isometric projection became less common with the advent of more powerful 3D graphics systems, and as games began to focus more on action and individual characters.[32] However, games using isometric projection have seen somewhat of a resurgence in recent years, especially on Kickstarter.[32]In the fields of computer and video games and pixel art, the technique has become popular because of the ease with which 2D sprite- and tile-based graphics can be made to represent a 3D gaming environment. Because parallelly projected objects do not change size as they move about the game field, there is no need for the computer to scale sprites or do the complex calculations necessary to simulate visual perspective. This allowed older 8-bit and 16-bit game systems (and, more recently, handheld and mobile systems) to portray large 3D areas easily. And, while the depth confusion problems of parallel projection can sometimes be a problem, good game design can alleviate this.There are also gameplay advantages to using an isometric or pseudo-isometric perspective in video games. For instance, compared to a purely top-down game, they add a third dimension, opening up new avenues for aiming and platforming.[32] Secondly, compared to a first- or third-person game, they allow you to more easily field and control a larger number of additional units, such as a full party of characters in a role-playing game.[32] Further, they may alleviate situations where a player may become distracted from a game's core mechanics by having to constantly manage an unwieldy 3D camera.[32] I.e. the player can focus on playing the game itself, and not on moving and rotating the camera.[32]Lastly, there is an artistic advantage. Though not limited strictly to isometric video games, pre-rendered 2D graphics can possess a higher fidelity and use more advanced techniques than may be possible on commonly available computer hardware, even with 3D hardware acceleration enabled.[33] Similarly to modern CGI used in motion pictures, graphics can be rendered once on a powerful super computer or render farm, and then displayed on less powerful consumer hardware, such as tablet computers and Web browsers. This means that static pre-rendered isometric graphics often look better compared to their real-time rendered counterparts, and may age better over time compared to their peers. However, this advantage may be less pronounced now than it was in the past.One disadvantage of pre-rendered graphics is that, as display resolutions continue to increase, the static 2D images need to ideally be re-rendered to keep pace, or otherwise suffer from pixelation. This is not always possible, however; as was the case in 2012, when BioWare's Baldur's Gate (1998) was remade into Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition by the studio Beamdog. The new developer opted for simple 2D graphics scaling, or \"zooming\", without re-rendering the game's sprites, as they were lacking the game's original creative art assets. (The original data was lost in a flood.[34]) Changing the resolution of a real-time rendered game is trivial, in comparison.The projection commonly used in videogames deviates slightly from \"true\" isometric due to the limitations of raster graphics. Lines in the x and y directions would not follow a neat pixel pattern if drawn in the required 30° to the horizontal. While modern computers can eliminate this problem using anti-aliasing, earlier computer graphics did not support enough colors or possess enough CPU power to accomplish this. So instead, a 2:1 pixel pattern ratio would be used to draw the x and y axis lines, resulting in these axes following a 26.565° (arctan 0.5) angle to the horizontal. (Game systems that do not use square pixels could, however, yield different angles, including \"true\" isometric.) Therefore, this form of projection is more accurately described as a variation of dimetric projection, since only two of the three angles between the axes are equal to each other (116.565°, 116.565°, 126.870°).While the history of computer games saw some true 3D games as soon as the early 1970s, the first video games to use the distinct visual style of isometric projection in the meaning described above were arcade games in the early 1980s.The use of isometric graphics in video games began with the appearance of Sega's Zaxxon,[35][3] released as an arcade game in January 1982.[2] It is an isometric shooter where the player flies a space plane through scrolling levels. It is also one of the first video games to display shadows.[35]Another early isometric game is Q*bert,[7] which Warren Davis and Jeff Lee began programming in April 1982 and released in October/November 1982.[6] Q*bert shows a static pyramid in an isometric perspective, with the player controlling a character which can jump around on the pyramid.[35]The following year in March 1983, the isometric platformer arcade game Congo Bongo was released, running on the same hardware as Zaxxon.[29] It allows the player character to move around in bigger isometric levels, including true three-dimensional climbing and falling. The same is possible in the arcade title Marble Madness, released in 1984.At this time, isometric games were no longer exclusive to the arcade market and also entered home computers with the release of Blue Max for the Atari 8-bit family and Ant Attack for the ZX Spectrum in 1983. In Ant Attack, the player could move forward in any direction of the scrolling game, offering complete free movement rather than fixed to one axis as with Zaxxon. The views could also be changed around a 90 degrees axis.[36] The ZX Crash magazine consequently awarded it 100% in the graphics category for this new technique, known as \"Soft Solid 3-D\".[7]A year later the ZX Spectrum saw the release of Knight Lore, which is generally regarded as a revolutionary title that defined the subsequent genre of isometric adventure games.[3] Following Knight Lore, many isometric titles were seen on home computers – to an extent that it once was regarded as being the second most cloned piece of software after WordStar, according to researcher Jan Krikke.[37] Other examples out of those were Highway Encounter (1985), Batman (1986), Head Over Heels (1987)[5] and La Abadía del Crimen (1987). Isometric perspective was not limited to arcade/adventure games, though; for example, the 1989 strategy game Populous used isometric perspective.Throughout the 1990s some very successful games like SimCity 2000 (1994), Civilization II (1996), X-COM (1994), and Diablo (1996) used a fixed isometric perspective. But with the advent of 3D acceleration on personal computers and gaming consoles, games previously using a 2D perspective generally started turning to true 3D (e.g. perspective projection) instead. This can be seen in the successors to the above games: For instance SimCity (2013), Civilization VI (2016), XCOM: Enemy Unknown (2012) and Diablo III (2012) all use full 3D; and while Diablo II (2000) used a fixed perspective like its predecessor, it optionally allowed for perspective scaling of the sprites in the distance to lend it a \"pseudo-3D\" appearance.[14]Also during the 1990s, isometric graphics began being used for Japanese role-playing video games (JRPGs) on console systems, particularly tactical role-playing games, many of which still use isometric graphics today. Examples include Front Mission (1995), Tactics Ogre (1995) and Final Fantasy Tactics (1997)—the latter of which used 3D graphics to create an environment where the player could freely rotate the camera. Other titles such as Vandal Hearts (1996) and Breath of Fire III (1997) carefully emulated an isometric view, but actually used perspective projection.Black Isle Studios and BioWare helped popularize the use of isometric projection in role-playing games in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These studios utilized the Infinity Engine game engine in several of their titles, developed by BioWare for Baldur's Gate (1998). This engine gained significant traction among players, and many developers since then have tried to emulate and improve upon it in various ways.[32] The Infinity Engine itself was also revamped and modernized recently by Beamdog in preparation for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (2012), as well as their remakes of several other classic Infinity Engine titles.Two other titles by Black Isle Studios, Fallout (1997) and Fallout 2 (1998), used trimetric projection.Isometric projection has seen continued relevance in the new millennium with the release of several newly-crowdfunded role-playing games on Kickstarter.[32] These include the Shadowrun Returns series (2013-2015) by Harebrained Schemes; the Pillars of Eternity series (2015-2017) and Tyranny (2016) by Obsidian Entertainment; and Torment: Tides of Numenera (2017) by inXile Entertainment. Both Obsidian Entertainment and inXile Entertainment have employed, or were founded by, former members of Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment; and Obsidian Entertainment in particular wanted to \"bring back the look and feel of the Infinity Engine games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment\" with Pillars of Eternity.[32] Lastly, several pseudo-isometric 3D RPGs, such as Divinity: Original Sin (2014), Wasteland 2 (2014) and Dead State (2014), have also been crowdfunded using Kickstarter in recent years. These titles differ from the above games, however, in that they use perspective projection instead of parallel projection.Rather than being based purely on nostalgia, the revival of isometric projection is the result of real, tangible benefits as well.[32]The term \"isometric perspective\" is often misapplied to any game with an—usually fixed—angled, overhead view that appears at first to be \"isometric\". These include games that utilize trimetric projection, such as Fallout (1997)[15] and SimCity 4 (2003);[16] games that utilize oblique projection, such as Divine Divinity (2002)[39] and Ultima Online (1997);[18] and games that utilize a combination of perspective projection and a bird's eye view, such as Silent Storm (2003),[14] Torchlight (2009)[48] and Divinity: Original Sin (2014).[40] There are also titles that utilize polygonal 3D graphics, but render their graphics to the screen using parallel projection instead of perspective projection. These include Syndicate Wars (1996), Dungeon Keeper (1997) and Depths of Peril (2007). And, there are a number of games that use a combination of pre-rendered and real-time rendered isometric graphics, such as The Temple of Elemental Evil (2003) and Torment: Tides of Numenera (2017), which use pre-rendered 2D backgrounds and real-time rendered 3D character models; and Final Fantasy Tactics (1997) and Disgaea: Hour of Darkness (2003), which use real-time rendered 3D backgrounds and hand-drawn 2D character sprites.One advantage of top-down oblique projection is that images fit more snugly within a square tile.One of the most common problems with programming games that use isometric (or more likely dimetric) projections is the ability to map between events that happen on the 2d plane of the screen and the actual location in the isometric space, called world space. A common example is picking the tile that lies right under the cursor when a user clicks. One such method is using the same rotation matrices that originally produced the isometric view in reverse to turn a point in screen coordinates into a point that would lie on the game board surface before it was rotated. Then, the world x and y values can be calculated by dividing by the tile width and height.Another way that is less computationally intensive and can have good results if our method is called on every frame, rests on the assumption that a square board was rotated by 45 degrees and then squashed to be half its original height. A virtual grid is overlaid on the projection as shown on the diagram, with axes virtual-x and virtual-y. Clicking any tile on the central axis of the board where (x, y) = (tileMapWidth / 2, y), will produce the same tile value for both world-x and world-y which in this example is 3 (0 indexed). Selecting the tile that lies one position on the right on the virtual grid, actually moves one tile less on the world-y and one tile more on the world-x. This is the formula that calculates world-x by taking the virtual-y and adding the virtual-x from the center of the board. Likewise world-y is calculated by taking virtual-y and subtracting virtual-x. These calculations measure from the central axis, as shown, so the results must be translated by half the board. For example, in the C programming language:This method might seem counter intuitive at first since the coordinates of a virtual grid are taken, rather than the original isometric world, and there is no one-to-one correspondence between virtual tiles and isometric tiles. A tile on the grid will contain more than one isometric tile, and depending on where it is clicked it should map to different coordinates. The key in this method is that the virtual coordinates are floating point numbers rather than integers. A virtual-x and y value can be (3.5, 3.5) which means the center of the third tile. In the diagram on the left, this falls in the 3rd tile on the y in detail. When the virtual-x and y must add up to 4, the world x will also be 4.“A well-executed isometric system should never have the player thinking about the camera. You should be able to quickly and intuitively move the view to what you need to look at and never consider the camera mechanics. Trying to run a full-3D camera while playing out a real-time tactical battle is certain to cause a helmet fire in new players as they are quickly overwhelmed by the mechanics.”— Trent Oster, co-founder of BioWare and founder of Beamdog, [32]",

In the modern world, individual pixels are only for the eyes of the designer who is permitted to see the design close up, rather than the audience who see the complete and smooth rendering of the image. However, recently there has been a trend towards pixel art that is doing just the opposite of this and proudly showing the pixels on display, warts and all. Is this new trend of pixel art just nostalgia for a bygone era or could we soon be seeing more pixels finding their way into graphic design and art work?‘The Starry Night’ by Van Gogh re-imagined into pixel art by Joo JaebumPixel art has its origins in early drawing and painting software and was popularised by computer game design through the ’80s and ’90s. It is created on graphics software that allows images to be edited at the individual pixel level. The images that are constructed are reminiscent of early computer games or amateur-made mobile phone video games, both of which would have been created by a pixel artist.An example of a computer software interface used to create pixel art. Image from Joo JaebumWhile a greater number of pixels involved in the design results in a cleaner, smoother image, in most of today’s programs you cannot see the individual pixels. However, early computer programs and devices did not have the capability to display the number of pixels required to create such an image. It was up to the pixel artist to find a way round these limitations by constructing a believable image from a limited number of pixels.  Today, with a few exceptions, the technology largely does exist; however, many artists are continuing to choose a limited number of pixels to emphasise the individual squares, giving a retro quality to their art.The term ‘pixel art’ dates back to 1982, and to the Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre where it was first published and popularised by Adele Goldberg and Robert Flegal. Goldberg and Flegal may well have coined the term but pixel art as a concept originates 10 years prior to this with Richard Shoups 1972 SuperPaint system. The 1970s may well have been the advent of computer generated pixel art, but some rightly claim that it is merely an imitation of ancient art forms, such as mosaic, bead-work and embroidery. If you take a look at the pointillist technique, developed by Georges Seurat and Paul Signac in the 1880s, the similarity with pixel art is apparent. In pointillism, the painter uses small dots of colour to make up an image. With pixel art the painted dots of colour are simply replaced by squares on a computer screen.‘La Tour Eiffel’ by Georges Seurat, created in the pointillist style, is reminiscent of modern day pixel art‘The Channel at Gravelines, Evening’, also by Seurat, uses dots of colour whereas pixel art uses squaresAll prior art forms that use small coloured units to construct larger pictures have undoubtedly had some influence on the continuation of the use of pixels and the popular appeal of modern day pixel art.In the early days of computer and console video games, pixel art was the main way of constructing the images on screen. The results were endearing; who can forget the pixelated worlds of Super Mario, Pokemon or Zelda? All these titles may well have had fantastic game play, but it is the pixelated  images that remain as symbols of video game culture. The rise of 3D graphics, and their ability to more closely mimic reality on powerful games consoles, has seen pixel art become outdated in the professional video games industry.Despite this downward trend, pixel art continues to remain very popular among amateur games design enthusiasts, especially since the mobile gaming industry took off. Compared to computers and video game consoles, mobile phones still generally have a low resolution and memory, and any games crafted for these devices require skillful use of memory and space by the designer. Amateur pixel art enthusiasts have found this to be a great arena to show off their skills in design.It’s not just in the games industry that pixel art is experiencing a resurgence, and many artists and design agencies are now employing the art form in their own stand-alone designs. EBoy are a pioneering graphic design group that specialise in pixel art for advertising and have been doing so since 1998. Their huge list of top name clients, including Nike, Paul Smith, Playstation, Kidrobot and many more, prove pixel art’s popularity and appeal as well as the power an image created with pixels can have on an audience. Kai Verschamer of eBoy explained to us that pixel art can never become outdated due to the fact it is so basic and so enjoyable to work with:“We chose to work with the pixel because we wanted to be able to control the smallest part of the screen. It turned out that the limitations and the modular nature of pixels were big fun to make things with.”eBoy are famous for creating highly detailed, pixelated cityscapesEboy are currently reconstructing the city of Miami using pixels and are planning to work on a number of other pixel art versions of cities in the future.Following the example set by eBoy, there are many modern designers that are using pixel art in interesting ways, creating what can only be described as a “new wave” of pixel art. Below are a few of these new pixel art enthusiasts who have found pixels to be the perfect format for conveying their artistic expression.Joo Jaebum is a pixel artist who is keen to spread his practice across the world and inspire a new generation of digital artists. He recently held a successful exhibition of his pixel art work, which includes many pieces that pay homage to work from renowned artists in South Korea.“Once I was trying to make my profile image in Photoshop. First I dotted my face onto this empty layer with 1 pixel brush tool. That was the start.“Pixel art is a very concise expression but it gets across the essence effectively. With skill, I can express everything through the minimum number of dots.”The familiar work of George Seurat, the master of pointillism, rendered into pixel art by Joo JaebumJoo Jaebum takes classic works of art and gives them an expert pixel art make over. This time it’s MuchaThis time Van Gogh gets the pixel art treatment. Joo Jaebum’s attention to colour and detail is highly skilledAdam Flynn is a graphic designer and photographer from British Columbia, Canada. A graduate of graphic design, he has worked with a number of clients on various projects and still experiments with new design techniques. His ‘Glitched’ series, pictured below, was a graphic experiment inspired by his love of pixel art.“Pixel and Glitch art is so interesting to me because there are many different techniques and seemingly infinite outcomes. When it comes to glitch art, the process is very unique compared to traditional art or design, since when I am working on a piece I have no idea how the final composition will look; it is all a combination of experimentation and random series of computer ‘errors’ that build the artwork. I almost view glitch art as a modern or technological interpretation of the Japanese aesthetic view of ‘Wabi-sabi’, which is finding beauty in imperfection.”Adam Flynn’s ‘Glitched’ series uses broken pixels to produce accomplished works of abstract artHe uses colourful pixels and distorts them with algorithms to create unique patternsAdam’s set of seven prints are available on his websiteJames Svard is a teacher of Architecture and the Built Environment in Sweden. In his spare time, however, he enjoys creating art using his computer and has been doing so since the 1980s, when pixel art was pretty much the only option for digital designers.“I got my first Commodore 64 (one of the first 8-bit home computers) back in 1987 and after a few years I saw it was possible to do audio/visual concepts; what were called “demos” in the scene. On and off, I’ve kept my interests around 8-bit graphics and occasionally participate with graphics and design. I don’t see it as a nostalgic gesture or a retro dream of the past, quite on the contrary. I do images in real life and there is a translation back and forth, whether it’s going to be a purely digital image or an illustration or painting on canvas.“There is something lovely about the restrictions and the 16 colours. They make you think differently about how to compose an image, compared to when you draw by hand, paint etc. It makes you focus on the economy of an image. I use all possible techniques available, from sketching on paper, scanning and tweaking in Photoshop CC, to return to a native graphics mode. This is also a technique I use when I do much of my paper-illustrations.”A pixelated James Svard appears in this pixel art self-portraitThe pixels add an unnerving effect to James’s ‘Wacek’This pixel painting, entitled ‘Yulia’ is very reminiscent of mosaic workWhile at its core pixel art uses some of the basic principles and techniques of popular and ancient art, such as mosaic and pointillism, we are continuing to see more and more inventive and artistic ways of using computer generated squares of colour to create images. Even as computer design software advances, you can expect that there will always be a place in art for the pixel.Kick-start your own graphic design career by studying online towards a BA (Hons) Graphic Design or MA Graphic Communication degree.

Из этой идеи родился \"Pixel Walker\"Это движок, генерирующий собственную, уникальную графику:Все объекты, которые видно на изображении, генерируются случайным образом, исходя из типа объекта и заданных параметров.Я уже придумал несколько интересных проектов на этом движке, и усердно работаю над ними, но об этом я расскажу немного позже!12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031",
      "First of all, if you fell here and don’t know the Godot Engine, it’s an awesome game engine (and it is free and open-source). You can see more on the official website.So, I’m writing this because Godot Engine has some tricks (not hacks) that turn Godot Engine into the best game engine for pixel art games. If you already know Godot Engine, you know that it has a dedicated 2D engine with no hacks and pixels as units. That’s really amazing, but that’s not all.If you already tried Godot Engine, you should probably know that in the default configuration the engine applies filters to your textures. Obviously this is not cool for pixel arts. To avoid this, you need to disable texture filters and mipmap generation (click here if you don’t know what mipmap is).If you try to inspect a texture in the editor, you’ll find an option called flags that contains filters and mipmaps enabled. If you disable them, it will automatically create a “flag” file for that texture. This looks promising but… what if your game has bazillion of textures?Well, that feature is useful only if you need to change flags for specific textures. Fortunately, there is a global way to disable filters and mipmaps in the project settings.Sometimes you need to create a pixel art game that can be resized, for example if you want to create a game for LOWREZJAM, you’ll need to resize the viewport because playing a game in 64x64 is a bit difficult.So, this is very simple to set up. In the Display section, you can set the game resolution that will be used as an internal/native resolution. Then you can enable the screen stretch that will stretch the screen when you resize the window.There are 2 options for the stretch mode: viewport and 2D. For now select the mode “viewport” (I’ll talk about the modes below). Also, you’ll probably want to keep the aspect ratio of the screen, so you can also configure it.Many pixel artists know that rotating pixels is something very ugly, visually speaking. For a very simple reason, a pixel is not something rotatable if you consider how a screen works.On the other hand, some developers prefer to rotate the pixels. Regardless of which one is right, in Godot Engine you can do both depending on the screen stretch mode you use.In the viewport mode, the entire viewport will be resized and the internal resolution will be maintained, this will prevent any pixel from being rotated.However, in 2D mode, the sprites will be resized and the internal resolution will be neglected so the pixels can be rotated if you want. This mode is actually useful if you are working with general/HD art.So, you are creating a true pixel art game, with a low resolution and using the screen stretch in the viewport mode. Now you have a new problem because of floating point numbers in your game code.If you create some animations to move your sprites, or move your sprite considering the delta time, you will have some problems of imprecision in the coordinates. This is because sometimes the position of your sprite will be a floating point number, not an integer. For example, if the X-axis is 0.5, that means your sprite is positioned half-pixel to the right.The problem is that there is no half-pixel if you are dealing with a perfect pixel positioning. This results in some visual glitches when the coordinates are not integer numbers.To fix that, just enable the 2D pixel snap in the project settings (Display section). It’s really simple, isn’t it?That’s all. This is what you need to know to start using Godot Engine for pixel art games. Many developers using Godot Engine should already know these tricks, but I’m sure a lot of people still don’t know. For this reason, I wrote this mini-guide on how to configure the Godot Engine for pixel art games, so you can avoid some of these issues.Systems Analyst and Game Developer at @NovastrikeMEDIA; Supporter of open-source initiative; I 💜 Python and Godot Engine; Dyslexic but learning English and 日本語",
      "By\nMatt Swider\n2018-07-21T05:41:11ZPhonesThe camera is the best part of the Pixel 2 experience. Pictures are consistently in focus and true-to-life while still looking vibrant. Color accuracy is what Google gets right.That actually doesn’t do this camera justice. Photos taken in low-light conditions, likely a dimly lit restaurant, looked as if we had turned on the lights when using the Pixel 2. Everything seemed a lot darker when using the iPhone 8 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 8, which you’d expect to be the two smartphone camera leaders.Watch our camera review of the the Pixel 2 below.Google’s 12.2MP main camera, with an f/1.8 aperture, and 8MP selfie camera, with an f/2.4 aperture, bests its competition in almost all ways. It has a background-blurring portrait mode both on the front and back camera, 240fps slow motion video and settings that get deeper than any Google camera before today.The default camera software isn’t perfect, however. Both Samsung and LG make it easier to snap a timed photo with a convenient hand gesture, while Google forces you to tap buttons. In group photos, this either results in an awkward face for the photo-taker who lunges to press the button while holding the phone out, or having to configure the timer while the group waits. We also miss the easy swipe-to-switch gesture to transition between the main and selfie cameras, which both Samsung and LG do so well.The photo quality is best-in-class, even without a second telephoto camera, and the video quality is steady with electronic image stabilization. This phone has optical image stabilization (OIS) this year and proves steady in our tests, more so than the original Pixel phones.If you’re looking for the best camera on a mobile phone, you’re not going to be disappointed with your photos. It’s now the leader among smartphone cameras.The Google Pixel 2 battery lasts all day with moderate use, which you may not expect given its rather small 2,700mAh battery size. It saves power in a number of important ways.Its 1080p screen is a secret weapon to burning fewer unnecessary pixels, even when the screen remains bright. Google also has fairly smart Android Oreo battery saving options right in the notification shade. This can help extend the battery life beyond a day if you’re careful enough.Running a looped HD video at full brightness and at a full charge resulted in 86% remaining in the battery life tank. That’s about average for smartphones of this size. You’re not going to be disappointed, but you’re also not going to be impressed with how this one performs.While the Pixel 2 charges quickly thanks to fast charging, we’re sad that Google hasn’t found a way to display the battery life percentage whenever you charge a turned off phone. Every other Android phone can do this. When charging a phone from 0%, it’s impossible to tell if it’s at 10% or 100% unless you boot up the phone mid-change. That’s a bit annoying.Current page:\n\nBattery life and cameraGet the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!TechRadar is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

      "< InstallationsBio >I started my career in game development by creating pixel art to modify games, so it's an artform I think of very fondly. There exists a feeling that there's a \"correct\" image you're moving towards, pixel by pixel, and a rhythm from the pixel grid that's very pleasing to the eye. I think this focus on grids has really informed the way I do a lot of things, especially graphic design.Dwarf Fortress is a difficult game to learn and the intimidating visuals discourage many from ever trying. I designed Jolly Bastion to drastically overhaul the atmosphere while improving the readability of the game through a sensible visual hierarchy. The limitations of DF give us only 16 colours and 255 non-overlaid tiles to represent thousands of plants, animals and minerals.A playful font and manual anti-aliasing grant a softer look to the game. Sticking to the shapes of the original ASCII gives maximum readability to silhouettes. A delicate combination of natural colours and hue-shifted shadows in tiles achieves a look of warmth. A complex per-tile inversion of tone grants visual depth to caves and terrain."

    "title": "Dead Cells",
    "text": [
      "Dead Cells is a roguelike-metroidvania hybrid video game developed by Motion Twin. Following about a year in early access, Dead Cells was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on August 7, 2018.\nIn the game, the player takes the role of a body of cells that take control of a corpse in a dungeon, through which they must fight their way out. The player gains various weapons, treasure and other tools through exploration of the procedurally-generated levels to fight undead creatures within it. At times, the player may gain \"cells\", a type of in-game currency that can be used to purchase permanent upgrades for the player if they reach a vendor near the end of each level. If they fail to reach this vendor before dying, they lose all the cells they gained and must start again. Motion Twin was inspired by The Binding of Isaac in developing the game.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nDead Cells is described as a \"roguevania\", a combination of procedurally-generated roguelike games and action-exploration-based metroidvania games. The player controls a mass of cells that occupy and control the body of a deceased prisoner at the start of each game. As they explore a series of dungeons and fight the creatures within, they collect weapons, armor, abilities, power-ups, and money. Some enemies will also drop cells when defeated, which can be used to obtain permanent power-ups such as additional health potions or new items that can be bought or found in later runs. These cells can only be spent at the end of a dungeon section; if a player dies before then, they lose all collected cells.Each level is procedurally generated by merging of predesigned sections in a random configuration along with random placement of enemies and items. The game's combat is said to be similar to the Souls series, with difficult enemies with certain behaviors the player can learn, and where frequent player-character death is a fundamental part of the game. At intervals throughout the game, the player must also defeat boss enemies known as \"Keepers.\" Currently, there are four Keepers in the game—the Incomplete One, The Watcher, The Assassin, and The Hand of the King.\nThe game includes Twitch integration, allowing viewers, via the stream's chat, to influence the game, such as voting for which upgrade paths the player should take.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe plot of Dead Cells is minimalistic, only giving bits of information to the player. Taking place on an unnamed island, the player character is referred to as the Prisoner, a humanoid with a smoky flame in place of a head. The Prisoner is a silent protagonist, but occasionally shows some personality traits such as confusion or frustration (giving the finger on several occasions). The Prisoner is immortal, as every time he or she dies their \"head\" manages to lurch its way back to the starting prison. According to a guard, the Prisoner is said to have been executed for some crime, but the nature of the crime is never specified.\nEvery time the Prisoner dies, the island reconfigures itself, which serves as an explanation for the rogue-like mechanics. In the game, the reason for this is specified as the island being a living organism that evolves over time.\n\n\n== Development ==\nDead Cells's developer Motion Twin had been developing games for the browser and mobile gaming market since 2001. The studio found that competition in the mobile market required more investment to make viable games, and decided to switch focus to develop what they considered their \"passion project\", a game that was \"something hardcore, ultra-niche, with pixel art and ridiculous difficulty\" that they knew would be a potential risk in terms of interested players. Motion Twin's producer, Steve Filby, said that The Binding of Isaac was a significant influence, as there, the way the game proceeds \"is entirely based on the choice of items that you get. That’s the fun of the game.\"Initially, Motion Twin had set out to include more elements of tower defense in the game, having the player drop turrets or similar traps to defeat monsters, but found this was not interesting. They took inspiration of the Engineer class from Team Fortress 2, where the use of turrets and other buildable items helps to strengthen the character's abilities, and took Dead Cells into an action platformer where the player used weapons along with a variety of skills (including some elements they had developed for the tower defense approach). They did not want players to get used to having a single weapon/skill combination that they used indefinitely, and arranged the roguelike elements as to require the player to try out new combinations of weapons and skills as they progressed in a given run to defeat newer foes, and keeping what items they would get in a random manner every time they started a new game. To give the player enough options, the developers crafted about 50 different weapons, avoiding having too much duplication in how each weapon worked so that there would be unique gameplay possibilities with each. The team used an iterative process in gameplay and graphics and art so that each of these weapons also exhibited unique animations or behavior so that the player would get a sense of a tactile response and the special nature of each weapon.Motion Twin opted to use Steam's Early access approach to both gauge interest and to get real-time feedback from players on game features and the balance from procedural generation. Lead designer Sébastien Bénard estimated that 40 to 50% of the features in the final game were drawn from feedback during early access. The early access period was launched on May 10, 2017 with support for Microsoft Windows, and released macOS and Linux versions in early access on June 26, 2018.   In November 2017 the game was also released on GOG.com as part of their drive to provide an alternate way to purchase games that are in development. In January 2018, Motion Twin also stated they are planning on console development for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, with a planned release in August 2018 to correspond with the Windows' version leaving early access. Motion Twin does not anticipate creating a sequel, and instead focused on adding a robust modding system for the personal computer versions to allow players to expand the game following release.Dead Cells was fully released on August 7, 2018 for computers and consoles. Retail editions of the game are expected to also ship later in August 2018.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nAbout a year from its early access release, Dead Cells has sold over 730,000 units, and exceeded 750,000 units just prior to its full release.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

      "Jump to navigationMotion Twin is a small, French game development company located in Bordeaux, France. From there, the 10-man team has created a multitude of mobile games. But what happens when they shift over into making a game for PC/console?That result is Dead Cells, a roguelike, Castlevania-inspired, action-platformer. The game combines all of the fun of platformers, without the hassle of trick edges, with the fun of quick and visceral combat in a non-hardware intensive package. While the game is still in Early Access on Steam, Motion Twin plans to release the game on PC, Xbox, Playstation, and Switch.The devs over at Motion Twin took the time to talk with us in an email interview about their first major step into the PC/console world and what it has taken to come this far. For a more in-depth look at Dead Cells, check out our preview of it here.GameCrate: Let’s get the obvious question out of the way first. Can you tell us when you plan to release Dead Cells officially?Motion Twin: We're aiming for Q3/Q4 2018. That’s a vague answer, I’ll give you that. But with the inherent uncertainty of video game development, we would rather announce a definite release date only when we’re sure we won’t miss it.GC: Steam Early access games have gotten a lot of criticism for over-promising and under-delivering, among other things—What has your experience on Early Access been like so far?MT: On our side, the feedback from the community has been invaluable and quite positive. The Early Access had a substantial, constructive, impact on the game, there’s no debate there. From  the players perspective… Do we under-deliver? I guess you’d have to ask them directly, but based on the press and players’ reviews, we seem to be doing a reasonable job of delivering what we say we will. No matter what happens, we always do our best to deliver and explain why we couldn’t if something stops us.GC: Anything you’d change about Steam’s Early Access process?MT: Not the process itself, but the communication tools we have for interacting with the community on Steam could use some love. We would rather keep the discussion in the Steam environment, but if we do it again, we may consider taking the time to build a decent forum with upvote/downvote mechanics for bugs and suggestions to allow us to reduce the “noise” and identify the priorities faster.GC: How dependent have you been on the early access users to give you feedback about balance and gameplay issues? Or even suggestions that have made the game better?MT: We don’t feel dependent on them, in the sense that we’ve always known what we wanted to build. However, when you receive heaps and heaps of feedback and become aware of all the balancing and design issues that the community finds and shares… then you realize that you’re indebted to them for the many improvements we’ve made based on that feedback. It’s more a question of creating a mutually beneficial partnership, we realize our vision, they point out where it’s falling flat, everyone wins.GC: What are the inspirations for Dead Cells? I’ve seen that the Lead Designer Sébastian Bénard said that Left 4 Dead and Faster Than Light were inspirations for the level design, but what about gameplay/combat, art design, and creature design?MT: Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is the primary inspiration for the game, I mean you just have to look at it to see that, but there are of course a stack of others. On the gameplay side, I know this has become a cliché by now, but we were really swayed by the Dark Souls series, especially some of the earlier versions of the game, when there was more focus on observation and taking your time. We gradually shifted toward a fast-paced game but kept the i-frames on the roll, the rally mechanic and the punishing enemy difficulty, as well, it feels great.On the art side, Mark of Wolves for its slick animations with surprisingly few frames, while the use of 3D in a 2D game was a process we found in Blazblue and Guilty Gear Xrd. No Man’s Sky was also an inspiration regarding the vibrant color palettes.GC: About the level design—How hard was it to find that balance between procedurally generated and fixed assets?MT: It’s definitely an intricate process. Since going full procedural didn’t work out, we then tried various formulas before finally settling on the current mix of about 50/50. Basically you want to build something that feels familiar with each run, yet is obviously different. You can’t design the familiarity with full random, so you have to temper it with a good dose of hand designed rooms and levels.GC: Things like the upgrade scrolls have gone through a couple changes so far. How have you approached balancing the game with things like that, or even the newly added foundry?MT: Lots and lots of spreadsheets! And, well, at the risk of sounding like a broken record… community feedback. Basically we design something, implement and release it through the alpha branch to the hardcore players to see what they think. This usually allows us to see very quickly if we’ve got any glaring oversights in there, then we balance based on the stats from players and their feedback on the forums.GC: This is Motion Twins first venture into the PC/console world. What are some major differences you’ve had to deal with in developing for PC/console instead of mobile?MT: Rediscovering a sense of purpose and happiness we had lost a long time ago? I joke, I joke… But the type of F2P games we were making when the internet was really democratizing gaming have transformed into something else. Now you need an analytics and acquisition team that’s bigger than your creative team to get past in that world. So the big challenge was letting go of our old habits and learning to make games based on those subjective qualities, making  “good” games.GC: What about the challenges of developing for PC, Xbox, Playstation, and Nintendo at the same time?MT: It’s a manpower issue before anything else. We didn’t have the bandwidth to handle it without slowing the development of the game, so we hired and now we’re good to go.GC: Nintendo has been notorious in the past for being hard to work with if you’re a 3rd party developer. What’s your experience been like?MT: Can’t complain! Interestingly, with Sony progressively backing out of the indie scene, we were expecting to witness Microsoft coming back as the major console partner for indies, XBLA style. They have been trying, but instead Nintendo have really taken the open position through a very indie friendly policy and hardware which is just as easy to work with.GC: Now, Nintendo users have often been described as more casual than those who would play games like Dark Souls. Do you think the style of gameplay that Dead Cells delivers might deter some of the Nintendo player base?MT: Probably. Challenging games can feel frustrating, and that may deter some players, no matter the platform. But on the other hand, the handheld nature of Nintendo’s new system seems tailored to the “short run” nature of the roguelite, so we hope it will balance out if there is anything to compensate for.GC: The randomness of weapons plays a big factor in the game. What would you say to people who would prefer to simply reset until they get a weapon combination they like at the beginning?MT: From our perspective, that seems like a big loss of time. The weapons you find at the beginning will quickly become obsolete. We think making do with what you get and trying new things are part of the charm of Dead Cells, so we try to incite players to experiment through the random weapons perks. But if they prefer to reroll until they get the “right” combination and that’s how they get their kicks, then that’s fine with us too.GC: Speaking of weapons—how many total weapons are there in the game? How many skills?MT: Around 60 weapons (including shields) and 30 skills.GC: Does the dev team have any favorite combinations they use?MT: Frantic sword/Ice bow is quite popular currently, but apart from that we all have different tastes. Some swear only by shields while other are turret lovers… of course they’re all wrong: everyone knows that nothing beats a trap and a good bow.GC: If the team could offer advice to new players what would it be?MT: Roll, roll, roll, and then roll some more.GC: What do you guys think of similar games like Hollow Knight?MT: Similar games? They can expect a letter from our lawyer as soon as they release… Just kidding. We don’t have a lawyer.Hollow Knight is a great game which took another approach to its combat system, offering huge amounts of content, and fully handcrafted level design. And that’s without even mentioning its beautiful art style. In the end it’s definitely a different experience.I think, apart from a strict copycat of Dead Cells, there will always be some differences between two games… And having more alternatives to choose from can only be a good thing.GC: Once Dead Cells is released do you plan to continue to add content to the game?MT: We already committed to offer a first free DLC to every owner of Dead Cells in the months following its release. It’s pretty much as far as we’re able think.GC: What comes after Dead Cells?MT: See our last answer! More games, bigger games, better games… But mostly just games.--You can check out Dead Cells on Steam Early Access for $19.99.

      "While many games today seem to release and then (hopefully) get fixed later, Dead Cells has been functional and fun for so long that it’s almost as if developer Motion Twin forgot to hit the release button. Marrying gorgeous pixel art with skill-based combat and cleverly randomised levels, this is a dangerously replayable action game that you can gorge on in long stretches or just in 20 exhilarating minutes before work.Take a deep breath, because we’re about to say the name of the genre. Dead Cells is the latest 2D pixel art metroidvania Soulslike roguelite action platformer to hit PC and console. Video games, eh? It’s a subgenre of a sub-sub-subgenre that actually manages to define more than a few other games on the horizon. It turns out people just can’t get enough of that sweet, sweet, Soulsy combat.Still — seems like a contradiction, doesn’t it? How can a roguelite with randomly generated levels also be a metroidvania, a genre known for its meticulously crafted and explorable worlds?The solution, like most of what Dead Cells offers, fees like a greatest hits of other games that’s somehow evolved into its own unique thing.Dead Cells achieves this by splitting everything up into different biomes. From The Sewers, to the Black Bridge, to the Clock Tower, these areas all have their own tilesets and enemies. The content within each is randomised every playthrough, but there are reliable constants. When you arrive at The Ramparts – a section of rooftops and towers patrolled by archers and mages – it’ll always be a lower level area with appropriately scaled gear.As you’d expect from a roguelike, players have a degree of control over which biomes they visit. Once you’ve obtained the ability to climb vines, or use statues to teleport, or even wall climb, these permanent skills let you access the previously inaccessible. Find the shortcut, and these abilities effectively effectively let you skip a few biomes.All of that spells more variety — though hell, even the repetition is fun in this game. Even going through areas we’ve beaten hundreds of times before, we didn’t get bored of them. It’s easy to lose yourself in that Soulslike flow when you’ve mastered an area and spend hours cutting through its enemies like so much butter.Whether you’re exploring the new, or dominating the old, it’s just a different kind of fun. In Dead Cells, the latter becomes from beating each area quickly, as opposed to just beating them. Why? Because timed rewards are waiting for those who go from slow to flow.We’re still playing this game a year after its Early Access launch, and that simply wouldn’t be the case if it didn’t rest on a rock solid combat system. Based on the “Souls roll,” hitting the dodge button here will grant you a second of invulnerability.Each weapon has its own moveset but importantly, these carry different conditions for critical attacks as well. It’s a unique system that gives each weapon an interesting playstyle and individual flavour.Take the Rapier for example, which crits after dodge rolls. Or the War Spear, which crits if it hits two enemies at the same time. The Twin Daggers crit on the third hit in their combo, and the Whip only crits on targets at the maximum thwack range.You may have noticed each of these has a nugget of risk/reward baked in. They also have different timings, such as a slightly longer attack animation on the Twin Daggers’ third strike. On top of this, all gear will come with randomised modifiers, which will be music to any Diablo fan’s ears.Players will balance weapon moveset familiarity with stats and synergies, each respawn an opportunity for ad-hoc theorycrafting. It satisfies cravings for both action and strategy in each playthrough.Perhaps you’re more comfortable with the Balanced Blade’s moveset, but that slower Oiled Sword might couple nicely with the Fire Grenade you just picked up? Every level has a series of interesting decisions for you to make while the clock is still ticking.It’s also a game that has a surprising amount to do. There are new biomes and bosses waiting for you as you get further and further into the island, but it doesn’t stop there. Beyond the main game and its copious unlocks, the developers have been adding different ways to have fun.For those who want to show off – or perhaps just need to catch a bus – Dead Cells is built from the ground up for speedrunning. Though “official” speedrunning rules would operate differently (Dead Cells pauses the timer in between levels while you upgrade), it’s neat being able to see how long each level has taken and each biome comes with a treasure room that can only be opened before a specific time.There’s also the daily challenge, another randomised gauntlet with a unique scoring system. This mode incorporates how many enemies you can take out while also keeping an eye on the clock. Seeing yourself at the top of the daily leaderboards will require you to keep that kill combo speed buff going for as long as possible.It’s hard to even talk about Dead Cells without sounding like a midnight shopping service – “but wait, there’s more!” – and just a few days ago Motion Twin threw a bunch more shiny new features onto the stack. Support was just added for modders which is always great for longevity, and expect Twitch streamers to be using fun gimmicks like requiring the chat to issue commands to open chests for them.We’ve seen Motion Twin add new bosses, levels, weapons, enemies, items, modifiers, and more over the last fourteen months. There’ve been redesigns, balance updates, and even a few less popular features removed outright to make sure the game flowed nicely.It’s mainly a result of listening to its community — a practice that Motion Twin might be uniquely placed to do, given its novel structure in which every employee owns the same portion of the company. “Same pay, same say” for everyone, according to Motion Twin.This is one of those titles we would’ve been happy with even at the start of its Early Access period. You could easily squeeze tens of hours from it back then, and over the course of fourteen months it’s just added more and more. Motion Twin could’ve flipped the “1.0” switch at any point to rapturous applause from its community.Lucky you then, dear reader, if you haven’t yet dipped into this insta-classic. Dead Cells is an example of how to do things right in so many ways. How to do Early Access. How to listen to your community. How to take inspiration from games while growing into your own style. It also happens to be the best time to jump in and ride the content train that’s sure to keep rolling for a long time to come.",

No checkpoints. Kill, die, learn, repeat.We're huge fans of Roguelikes and Castlevaniaâ¦ So it was only natural for us to give birth to their bastard son, the Roguevania.We especially love the threat, adrenaline and that addictive feeling of having no checkpoints to save you from your screw ups. Procedural generation is also a great way to provide a fair amount of diversity, while we make sure the level design always stays fun. We're aiming to offer a different experience in each and every run and still give the world a meticulously handcrafted feel.Yet, we also wish to add our little something something to the classic recipe of a Roguelike map. Instead of the regular, rigid progression between levels, we would rather leave some room for the player to choose their path. For instance, you could reach the dungeon, by taking on either the ramparts level or the sewers. Some paths will be shorter but harder, or maybe the foes there will be more suited to your playstyle. So, it's up to you to choose your strategy and make it as far as you can.And, it won't be easy. We choose to design the combat to be quite close to what you can find in the Souls games. Every weapon has its own unique gameplay and art, bosses and monsters are pattern-based, but at least, you still get invincibility frames on your roll.

      "Dead Cells is a game that shouldn't work. Created by a small independent studio Motion Twin, and releasing on all major gaming platforms, Dead Cells combines two of the most popular indie genres, the Metroidvania and rogue-like. The pairing doesn't make any sense. A Metrodvania game is all about exploring every corner of a game's environment to deepest level. Meanwhile, rogue-likes, by design, restart the game's layout with every player death.Against all logic though this fusion is a match made in gaming heaven. Dead Cells is difficult and at times very aggravating. Ultimately though the experience is one of rewarding discovery, fluid gameplay and a tremendous atmosphere. Dead Cells brings two played-out genres screaming back to life (over and over again).Related: IGN Releases Statement on Their Plagiarized Dead Cells ReviewThe premise of Dead Cells is simple. The playable character is a unnamed (headless) warrior who is trapped in an ever-changing dungeon and is forced to fight for his survival. Every round of Dead Cells begins the exact same way with the undead protagonist coming back to life in a jail cell. A short sword is always equipped at the beginning with the option of picking up a defensive shield or ranged bow later. Once out of that starting area, Dead Cells opens up into a world that as terrifying as it is alluring, full of new weapons, enemies, and repeated 'game over' screens.It's possible to beat Dead Cells in about 2 hours. The more accurate run time of the game though is around 10-15 hours though as trial and error are baked into Dead Cells' DNA. At first, Dead Cells and its shifting world seem overwhelming but there's always a sense of progression. Even though the world resets with every game over, each death is a learning experience, in a literal and figurative sense.Dying not only teaches players how enemies react and what moves that need to be used to attack them. Is it best to throw a grenade at a teleporting sword-wielding baddie or charge at them slicing them furiously with dual daggers? These questions are asked constantly in Dead Cells and finding the right answer is half the joy of the game. Success can also provide tangible benefits. Defeating certain \"elite\" type enemies and bosses give out permanent items that will stay in the inventory no matter how much Dead Cells hero meets his end. This is where the Metroidvania part of Dead Cells enters the picture. For example, vanquishing the first real boss gives access to a power that allows climbable vines to grow opening up whole new pathways and areas.Of even more importance to progression is the titular mechanic of the dead cells. Certain enemies will drop bright blue \"cells\" when they die. These cells can then be used at safe stations, scattered across the world, to purchase permanent upgrades. Among these upgrades are better starting weapons, more health flasks and a lot more. Dead Cells tracks and saves how many cells have been spent on each upgrade so even in the quickest runs there should be some manner of progress toward an upgrade or item as long as a safe station is reached at least once.These are just the big ways that Dead Cells makes itself a little less punishing. There are plenty of small tweaks and mechanics that keep the game balancing on the knife's edge of difficulty. Motion Twin has crafted everything in such a way that the game is always fun but still tense enough that every encounter has a sense of consequence.While the rogue-like aspect of Dead Cells helps more than it hurt, there is a downside. The world simply isn't as engaging as it should be due to its procedural design. It's always fun to roll, jump, and slash around but the dungeons would be more interesting if they was handcrafted, not created by an algorithm. There are even times when the level that's been formed since your a prior death is unfairly set up, whether because of the new platforming obstacles or an overwhelming amount of enemies in one area. 90% of the time a game over in Dead Cells is completely earned. However, the 10% it's not earned, really does rankle.In the grand scheme though the world of Dead Cells feeling a little less structured is a small qualm. It's even arguable to assert that the excitement of the ever-changing environment cancels out the design not being perfect all the time. Dead Cells does so much right that it's a must-play for anyone with the slightest interest in Metroidvania, rougelikes or just 2D gaming in general.4.5/5Dead Cells is available now for 24.99 on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.Tags:\ndead cellsThePremium grants you  UNLIMITED AD FREE ACCESS  accross our full Network!Have an account?

      "The stylish roguelike dungeon-crawler Dead Cells launched on PC in Early Access, and developer Motion Twin announced today that the full game will debut on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch as well. The release date has yet to be announced, though Motion Twin is hoping to roll it out before the fall.In Dead Cells, players take control of a nameless pile of green cells that possess a skeletal warrior. They hack, slice, and pierce their way through procedurally generated dungeons crawling with increasingly powerful enemies and punctuated with elite foes and boss fights. If they die, they return to the beginning, upgrade equipment that can appear during loot drops, and go at it again.“We always wanted to bring Dead cells to as much of the gaming community as possible but in all honesty, there is some form of egoism in it too,” said Motion Twin’s producer Steve Filby. “Most of us have some form of console and all of us have fond memories from ‘back in the day,’ so there’s that kind of geek dream come true vibe to it all … having our game on console, it’s a personal and professional milestone.”Dead Cells has been in Early Access since May and it’s sold over 600,000 copies. Filby says it’s been an excellent opportunity, helping the Motion Twin team tweak the mechanics and also find the “best parts of the game” and focus on those aspects.“Feedback on the balancing of the game is indeed a big part of it, but being in Early Access brings way more than that if you’re ready to listen to the community,” said Filby. “The whole metagame (the progression of the character throughout the runs) has been burnt to ashes and rebuilt to take into account suggestions from the players.”",

This is French developer Motion Twin's first 'proper' PC title, having previously focused on Flash and mobile games. That all changed in 2015, when the studio decided it was sick of working on these titles.\"When Dead Cells came about it was an idea of a spiritual successor to one of our really successful web games, Die2Nite,\" marketing and communications bod Steve Filby says.\"It was supposed to be a multiplayer online free-to-play cross-platform mobile web tower defence game. As we kept making prototypes, we just realised that we couldn't get the multiplayer to work; we just couldn't find a fun design. It looked good on paper, but when you sat down to play it didn't work.\"The head of Shiro Games, who shares our space, played the single player bit and told us we should make that as it was awesome. We tried to that and it was tower defence, but where the player could move around. We were still letting go of that mobile development and free-to-play web-based mentality. So we went: 'screw it' and made a full action-based platformer.\"But how did the mix of Metroidvania - exploration and platforming - and roguelike - procedural generation, permadeath - elements come about? Simple, sort of. Half the studio loved Metroidvanias; the other loved roguelikes.While nice and diplomatic, this raised other challenges for Motion Twin - namely that the project was quite buzzword heavy.\"When they decided to add the roguelike part in I was on holiday. I came back and they told me - I was like 'You're kidding me',\" Filby laughs.\"My job as producer is to make sure the game gets to market and that we make something that everyone is going to play. I had to take the idea and pitch it to publishers and saying: 'It's another pixel art roguelike platformer' and people are going to look at it and go: 'Well, what's new with this?'.\"It was a massive concern for us all. We were joking around and our art director came up with the term 'roguevania'. We were trying to make this kind of gameplay compelling. One of the difficulties, in the beginning, was getting the pitch into the person's hands because one of the cool things about Dead Cells is the combat. It feels nice. Getting past that initial hesitation from platform holders was a challenge. 'Okay, another roguelike game with pixel art and bits of Metroidvania' - that's just a load of buzzwords put together... that was something we had to overcome.\"In order to overcome this issue, Filby drew up a list of the top roguelikes and Metroidvania titles on Steam to give the team an indication of just how good Dead Cells had to end up being.\"When we started making these decisions, I was just following on behind saying: 'Okay, if you're going to make a roguelike game, these are the Top Ten entries in the genre on Steam - you have to be up here in the Top Three games. You want to add in Metroidvania aspects? Here are the Top Ten Metroidvania games - these are the ones you need to beat',\" he explains.\"So then we played the absolute shit out of all of those games, every single member of the team. We then sat down and looked at what those studios had done so that when we were making design decisions, we knew what we were talking about, we knew what we liked and what we did not. The big challenge was trying to come up with solutions to all the problems those games have faced over the years.\"The roguelike genre has certainly been a popular genre with indie developers, but not without its problems. Procedural generation - though potentially an efficient means of building a large game quickly - is actually pretty hard to get right. So Motion Twin opted for a balance between the randomness of algorithmic level creation and hard rules to make sure the game never felt unfair. \"\"It can go both ways when it comes to procedural generation. There's crappy procedural generation - there are games where you start up a run and you can see from the very first tile that you're screwed,\" Filby explains.\"It can be something you can't get past. We're trying to avoid these runs. That process of getting an algorithm that does that without randomness to make things interesting is long and hard. What we came up with was about 50:50 random and curated. Each chunk of a room is hand designed so that we know that certain jumps are doable, some bits are annoying but we made it that way so that's the point.\"When we moved from completely random to handmade chunks that are stitched together, we had random monster positioning. The problem was they'd come together in combinations that were just unfair. You come across enemies that are going to hit you all at once and you can't deal with them all. Once you sort all that it's very quick; but getting to that point is a long and iterative process.\"The title launched into Early Access back in May 2017. The decision to release this was was partly to do with the fact this was Motion Twin's first 'proper' PC game and - by Filby's own admission - the team were \"absolute noobs\". When it was first raised as a possible launch option, Early Access was wildly unpopular internally.\"We had a bit of an internal battle over Early Access; I wanted to do it and they were really against it,\" Filby says.\"Theirs was a kneejerk reaction about Early Access being full of crap or having a stigma. My argument was to look at what all these other games have done wrong and right in Early Access. It's about approaching the game as a professional development studio.\"We put out what we considered to be the core of the gameplay in a very polished state, missing half of the game. People respected that - they saw that it looked almost like a finished game. It wasn't finished - not even close - but people jumped on board with that. That was part of the strategy right from the beginning. The trick is to respect your community, follow through on your promises and don't oversell what you're doing. Also keep your community informed as to what you are doing.\"You can get the latest news and analysis about the business of PC games on Facebook, Twitter and Linkedin.

      "By Justin McElroy\non May 19, 2017\n            at 10:04amDead Cells is easy to summarize: It's a side-scrolling, Castlevania-style roguelike. But while that pat description may be accurate and frankly pretty enticing on its own, it also belies just how thrilling, addictive and expertly honed this early access game is.This is normally the bit where I'd lay out the story as a framing device, but frankly there's not much to say. You're a person without a head hell-bent on reclaiming cells for your decomposing body. That's about it.Maybe the \"story\" is due in a later version of Dead Cells, but I can honestly say I'm not missing it. When the action is this fluid and fun, it's hard to pine for a nonexistent plot. That action is the real star of the show, and I'm going to struggle to do it justice without just shoving a controller in your hand.Dead Cells somewhat resembles \"Metroidvania\" games, with sprawling 2D stages littered with items, secrets behind destructible walls, etc. But you won't be kept out of areas because you haven't unlocked the right tool, a hallmark of the genre. The only thing standing in your way is about a bazillion bloodthirsty enemies.As you weave your way through progressively punishing (and ever-changing) stages, you'll pick up a dizzying array of weaponry: two main weapons on the face buttons, two more powerful attacks on the triggers that require a bit of time between each use.You'll inevitably swap out weapons as you equip more powerful tools, and this is where Dead Cells really starts to shine.Your whip does mediocre damage ... unless you hit the enemy with its tip, which means a brutally effective critical attack. One sword does critical damage when your health is below half, which makes for a terrifying, thrilling run. There's a rapier that crits after right after you roll, making for much more mobile combat. Another weapon coats enemies in oil, not so great ... unless you have a fire attack to follow it up.Later, I found weapons that made for diabolical pairs, like, for example, a turret that poisons enemies and a fire grenade that just happens to do bonus damage to poisoned enemies.Those bonuses are randomly assigned, so I was constantly lured away from over-reliance on any one style of attack. And every weapon and tool changed my play style so dramatically that I was constantly learning and evolving. It's such a compelling formula that even after a devastating loss, I was always eager to hop right back in and see what new tools and techniques awaited me.And the losses will be devastating. Death means starting back at square one (roguelike, remember?) with everything on your person having vanished into the ether.There is solace to be had, though. As you claim cells from fallen enemies, you can use them to purchase new weapons or upgrade your existing arsenal. That is, assuming, you can keep them until the end of the stage, where your health is refilled and your cells can be redeemed. If you die while you're holding them ... yup, they're gone too.Over time, you'll find that you're able to push just a little bit further into the depths of Dead Cells, where increasingly enticing goodies lie in wait. There are also some special items that allow you to activate shortcuts and skip the early low-yield stages entirely, though doing so often thrusts you into deadly ground that you're woefully unprepared for.That's one of countless trade-offs in Dead Cells. Will you let go of your necklace that allows triple jumping to get one free death? Will you open a cursed chest if it means you'll die in one hit until it's lifted? These choices can be agonizing, but they also keep the game from ever feeling stale.There are no such compromises in Dead Cell's presentation, which blends 16-bit affect with modern, beautiful animation reminiscent of the rotoscoping in the original Prince of Persia. It's something to behold, and helps this already fluid game feel even smoother.There is, of course, still room for growth in this early version of the game. Some weapons, like the turret and magnet grenade that draws enemies in while electrocuting them, are so powerful that I feel frustrated if I'm not gifted them in a playthrough. Also, the benefits you get from parrying with a shield rarely feel worth the risk of putting yourself in the line of fire. I tend to avoid them entirely.Also, the randomly generated stages often create weird blind alleys that feel as though they would have a reward at the end, but don't. It would be nice for a little more variety in each level — once you start to recognize every element of them, it scarcely matters the way they're assembled.in Off-topic\nby mattwhite924in Off-topic\nby katnirtetin Off-topic\nby Kirielsonin Off-topic\nby Saliasin Off-topic\nby 'Shifter'© 2018 Vox Media Inc. all rights reserved •\n    Designed & Developed in housePartner site of The VergeAll Systems Operational\n  Check out our status page for more details.Game InfoPlatform\nWinPublisher\nMotion TwinDeveloper\nMotion TwinRelease Date\nMay 10, 2017",

      "Heat Signature is an action stealth video game developed by Suspicious Developments.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nHeat Signature is an action and stealth video game played from a top-down view. Players take control a member of a group of space mercenaries who embarks on a variety of missions such as hijacking space vessels, stealing technology, assassinating crew members, rescuing captives, and more. Operating from a central base, mercenaries take on missions that require the player to fly the mercenary via a small shuttlecraft to a travelling ship, dock with it, and then infiltrate the ship and return to home base safely. The ultimate goal is to liberate the strongholds of each of the four factions in a randomly-generated nebula. The nebula serves as a tech tree, allowing the player, with each liberation, to unlock various items, such as guns, gadgets, explosives, or pods. Each station within the nebula also includes a defector mission, which are specially developed missions that, in a way, operate as different challenges for the player to attempt; as they offer no monetary gain, these missions are typically completed out of leisure or as a way to practice for standard missions. The layouts of the nebulae, the ships, their crew, and missions are procedurally generated, similar to games of the roguelike genre.Normally, the game operates in real time. At any time, the player can pause the game, which then provides a menu screen that provides additional options for the player to perform, such as switching weapons, picking up or dropping inventory items, or taking remote control of the shuttle, as well as to plan their next move, such as selecting a target for their attack. This can be done indefinitely, allowing for stunts such as picking up the weapon of a fallen enemy, equipping it, and using it against another target all while in this pause screen. Thus, the game often becomes much more about prediction and somewhat turn-based strategy rather than devising and implementing tactics in real time.\n\n\n== Development and release ==\nHeat Signature was developed by Suspicious Developments, a team led by former PC Gamer editor Tom Francis. Development took about three years starting around December 2013, and cost around GB£200,000.The game was released for Microsoft Windows on 21 September 2017. At the time of release, Francis knew that releasing the game was \"biggest risk of [his] life\", as the indie game market was saturated with titles. He had hoped to see at least half the sales that he got with Gunpoint. Within the first week, he reported that the sales of Heat Signature had exceeded those of Gunpoint, and that the game was one of the top sellers on Steam during its initial week.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nHeat Signature received a favourable reception from professional critics.The game was nominated for \"Best Action Game\" at IGN's Best of 2017 Awards. It was also nominated for the \"Seumas McNally Grand Prize\" at the Independent Games Festival 2018.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
      "By\nSteven Messner\n2017-09-21T20:30:47.263ZReviewBy making excellent use of its procedurally generated world and wacky gadgets, Heat Signature is a mission worth taking.I smashed an unsuspecting guard so hard with a Concussion Hammer that his body went sliding down the corridor, comically coming to a stop at the feet of four of his peers. Oops, I thought. As the four other guards immediately began shouting and attacking, the spaceship's captain changed course for a safe station just 30 seconds away. I hadn't even gone more than four rooms without bungling the mission, and now I had just half a minute to salvage it before my character was captured. I never expected being my time as a space-faring rogue in Heat Signature would be so full of hilarious, little surprises.Fortunately, the captain was only a few rooms away. I could get to him easily—assuming nothing else went wrong. Using my Sidewinder, I teleported into the middle of the group of guards. They turned to me and opened fire. I paused, switched gadgets to my Emergency Shield, and activated it. In the split second between their bullets leaving their guns and hitting me, the shield switched on and deflected the rounds back at them. It was a bloodbath. Then, using my Long Range Key Cloner, I nabbed the passkey I needed from a guard several rooms away and entered the bridge. The mission was saved.I've lost count of how many of these moments I've experienced. Moments when my carefully laid plan crumbles to dust and I'm forced to make use of the pause feature to survey the situation and find some new path forward. Heat Signature is a wonderful procedurally-generated playground for those who love to experiment, fail, and adapt.Though it kind of looks like Hotline Miami, Heat Signature shares more DNA with Dishonored 2 except set in a procedurally generated sandbox galaxy. If that sounds ambitious for a game built in GameMaker, well, it is. At any time, even during a mission, other ships are zooming from station to station. During one mission, another ship attacked the one I was infiltrating, turning a stealthy theft into a frantic race to get the item and get out before a missile wiped me out.There is no real overarching narrative to Heat Signature—not one that I was bothered to care about, anyway. There's four big empires that rule the galaxy and you're part of a group of revolutionaries trying to overthrow them. To do this, you infiltrate their ships and murder, kidnap, and steal. There are some characters and story there to try and spice it up, but none of it was engaging enough to make me interested. The fun is solely found in unlocking new gadgets and testing my mettle by tackling progressively deadlier missions.There are plenty of unique ideas in Heat Signature. For one, you don't play as a single character but a revolving door of randomly generated mercenaries. When one dies or is captured, you're forced to pick a new recruit. Each of these characters has their own personal score to settle against one of the empires in the form of a personal mission, but their collective efforts also help convince nearby space stations to abandon their empire and join your cause. Doing so unlocks new gadgets to be bought with your earnings from completing missions. That the map is also a tech tree is one of Heat Signature's best ideas. Each empire has its own unique gadgets, like the Glitchers using teleporters, so I had to focus on what tech I wanted to unlock first as the expense of other options.When I first started playing, I stuck to easy missions to board ships that had only a few poorly equipped guards. I'd set out from my station in my 'pod,' a specialized ship that attaches to the airlocks of bigger vessels like a tick, and be back home in only a minute or two. Even with just a wrench, it was easy to make my way through the randomly generated corridors, knocking out guards en route to my objective.But, now nearing 20 hours of playtime, Heat Signature's challenge is daunting. Guards come equipped with shields and armor and cluster together in groups. Sometimes they'll explode upon death or can immediately teleport to suspicious noises. Sentry guns lock down entire corridors and special mission modifiers might reward me with extra pay if I adhere to restrictions like not raising any alarms or leaving any witnesses alive.It's when Heat Signature is the most difficult that it often spawns the best anecdotes. Like Spelunky, sometimes a simple interaction can have surprising consequences. One time I fired a grenade into a group of guards and when it exploded, it caused one of their guns to ricochet off a wall and accidentally discharge. The bullet whizzed into the adjacent room I was in and struck the fuel cell behind me. This all happened in the span of a second and I only noticed what went wrong because the fuel cell was glowing. I didn't have enough time to run from the impending explosion so I turned on my Emergency Shield to survive the blast but promptly found myself sucked out into space as the whole room exploded.I really enjoy that, in service of fun and experimentation, Heat Signature is quite forgiving. Getting hit once knocks you unconscious, but guards always toss you out of the airlock rather than finish you off. That gives you a moment to remote control your pod and scoop your body back up to try again—albeit with less time should you be injured again. But once you finally die, you and your gear are gone for good, and you have to continue the game with a new character.If you're captured, new recruits will often spawn with a personal mission to rescue you, letting you continue playing as the captured character. There's even a cool feature where your characters might appear in your Steam friends' games for them to rescue and play with.But rarely is being killed or captured an unexpected consequence. In the heat of action—or when things have gone wrong—I can always pause and plan my next step. Fights in Heat Signature have this pleasing stop-go pacing of split second action followed by seconds of careful consideration. This minute focus is very satisfying. I'd smack a guard with a wrench, pause, switch to a gun, shoot another, pause, teleport behind a third guard, pause, and lay a Glitch Trap at his feet that would teleport him to the cold vacuum outside the hull of the ship, leaving him to suffocate as his oxygen ran out. Despite that, I do wish the enemy AI was more challenging. They always patrol and move predictably and sometimes it was either to undermine a difficult mission just by picking them off one by one while on patrol.Despite the boring AI, Heat Signature's missions and pausable combat are enjoyable because of the dizzying variety of tools you can use. Sure, storming a ship with only a wrench is fun once or twice, but I love using Subverters to turn my enemies' shields against them so that bullets are deflected on the inside instead of the outside. Seeing a guard murdered by his own shotgun blast as it ricochets inside his shield is hilarious.Teleporters are another great gadget that I frequently make use of. Swappers can let me switch places with a guard while Visitors let me jump to one room for two seconds before snapping back. You can get pretty creative with these tools as well, like the time I used a Visitor to teleport outside the hull of a ship and then a Swapper to switch places with my assassination target.Stealth shields, electronics-disabling Crash Beams, room-destroying breach charges—the list goes on and on. Any of these items can be found in loot boxes on a ship, but once you unlock the appropriate station they'll always be available for purchase. Different stations might also unlock variants with more uses, longer reach, or rechargeable ammo. And because the galaxy is randomly generated, what gear you'll have access to first is also random.My only major complaint is that Heat Signature obviously pushes the limits of GameMaker. Slowdowns happen every so often and I experienced several crashes to desktop. Because missions are usually only a few minutes long, I never felt like I lost too much progress. It's still frustrating, though.And while I do enjoy the cycle of liberating stations to unlock more gear, it did begin to feel like a grind with no real endgame to look forward to. Once you start to unlock the most powerful gadgets, the intimidating threat that some missions initially pose erodes, and the thrill begins to die. Each liberated station offers Defector Missions which add a fun challenge by restricting what gadgets you can use. They're a great way to learn creative combos I hadn't thought of, like how to kill a room full of guards using only an Emergency Shield. But they ultimately feel like a distraction from a core campaign that struggles to entice after 15 hours.Still, those 15 hours are a great time. Heat Signature inspires creativity through emergent complexity like any great immersive sim. I can't stop regaling friends with my stories of heists gone bad or boasting about my flashes of brilliance in the heat of the moment. Heat Signature is brilliant at teasing these anecdotal threads out of a procedural universe.Disclosure: Heat Signature creator Tom Francis was an editor at PC Gamer for 10 years, leaving in 2013 after the release of his first game, Gunpoint.

      "Heat Signature rewards as much as it punishes. It takes away chunks of your hard-earned progress after even a minor mistake, but also gives you the tools to get out of impossible situations. With the right gadgets and weapons, you can overcome, or sneak by, an army of armored soldiers with only three seconds left on the clock before your invaded ships docks and you are captured. It can be terrifying, empowering, and heartbreaking, all in a single mission. The learning curve is steep, but once you break through, you arrive somewhere in a blissful middle ground between action and strategy.In Heat Signature, you play as a collection of disposable mercenaries who take on missions with difficulty qualifiers from “easy” to “mistake.” As you complete missions, you build your bank and inventory, which consists of weapons, hacking devices, and gadgets that let you teleport around a ship, or swap positions with the bad guys. You begin each mission by jumping into your ship and flying across a vast galaxy to quietly board the ship with your goal. You can pause as often and for as long you want to strategize for each encounter. Sometimes you assassinate someone on board. Other times, you kidnap a person or steal a piece of technology. Occasionally, you must do my favorite activity: Kill everyone on board and steal the entire ship.In one mission, for example, I boarded a ship with a collection of armored guards who could not be killed with normal weapons, and I had to capture one of them. Having prepared for the mission, I brought sidewinders to instantly travel the halls, key cloners to steal their keys, and an armor-piercing gun and sword. When encountering a group of two soldiers I would stab one, pause the game, switch to my gun, take careful aim, and fire it off making sure other soldiers nearby couldn’t hear. Killing small groups, stealing keys, and bypassing the large groups got me to my target, but without a weapon to incapacitate, I had to get creative. Using my gun, I lured the armored soldier to a window and shot it out when he got near. It flung us both into space, and while a timer counted down my oxygen I remote controlled my ship to come pick us up and carry us home so I could deposit my bounty. That was a missions that went smoothly, but during the rough ones plans collapse quickly, and you will fail fast. And If you fail your mission, that character is gone – along with their accumulated money and inventory.All is not lost when you lose a character, however. As you complete missions, you are able to liberate stations, which makes certain items permanently available at the store. Having the continuous progression to grow the store was the main motivator keeping me going. Losing characters is frustrating, and it doesn’t benefit the game in a dramatic way. Starting with a new character means replaying familiar, easy missions with small rewards until you get back to a point where you can rebuy something resembling your previous inventory, and that gets repetitive.The larger goal is liberating enough stations so you take on extremely difficult missions to free the galaxy’s four strongholds. These missions are intense; in one, I ran out of ammo on the gadget that disabled enemy shields and had to resort to blowing up sections of the ship and launching enemies out of windows into space in order to dispose of them. Knocking yourself and enemies into space is intense, and retrieving yourself by remotely piloting your ship, picking yourself up right before your oxygen expires, is exhilarating.The story is offered through dialogue with a small collection of NPCs explaining the universe and its intricacies. Each of your mercenaries also has a difficult-to-complete personal mission. Sometimes it involves getting revenge, other times it might require you to save a loved one. The writing is high-quality, with small jokes littered everywhere and interesting explanations from the few realized characters, but even with the personal missions, I never felt attached to any of my mercenaries. Once I had my heart broken by losing a few, I stopped feeling compelled to read their backgrounds. It doesn’t help that visually, the tops of their heads simply aren’t interesting making them hard to identify with and connect to. By then end, I just thought of them as containers for my valuable inventory.Heat Signature’s strength lies in its ability to make you think fast when you have all the time in the world. On more than one occasion, I sat with the action paused while a countdown in the single digits spelled doom for me, and I was able to use my collection of gadgets to teleport, fight, and hack my way to a position where I could disable the alarm. Of course, it was just as often that I stumbled and was immediately shot and dumped into space by the bad guys. It frustrates as often as it makes you feel like an unstoppable genius, which is a balance worth pursuing.© 1991 to \n  document.write(new Date().getFullYear());\n Game Informer.

We use exceptional demographic records on Asian elephants from timber camps in Myanmar to investigate the long-term consequences of wild-capture during 1951–2000 on their mortality (N = 5150). We show that captured elephants have increased mortality compared to captive-born elephants, regardless of their capture method. These detrimental effects of capture are similar for both sexes but differ substantially according to age. Elephants captured and tamed at older ages show a higher increase in mortality after capture than elephants captured and tamed young. Moreover, the increased mortality risk following capture and taming is still perceived several years after capture. Our results are timely given the continued capture of elephants and other wild animals to supplement captive populations despite the alarming declines of wild populations globally.Animals are captured from the wild in vast numbers each year for various purposes, including well-accepted causes such as conservation, population management and research1,2. The resulting captive populations offer attractive research opportunities for multidisciplinary studies with easier observation and experimentation, and they are often used for general inferences concerning the entire species (for example see ref. 3,4,5,6,7). Despite the acknowledged limitations of captive environments, such populations are also used as the reference group for optimum predation-free life-history or maximum longevity in evolutionary ecological studies (for example see ref. 8,9). While some species are indeed healthier, longer-lived and more fecund in captivity than their free-living conspecifics, others perform less well10,11. Although studies on the effects of captivity on life-history are accumulating2,11,12,13, less is known about the long-term differences between captive-born and wild-caught animals, despite a substantial proportion of captive individuals being obtained from the wild rather than born in captivity. Most of the existing research on the outcomes of wild-capture is concerned with the short-term elevated mortality risk that such operations may pose14,15,16,17,18. By contrast, evidence of the long-term consequences of capture and the resulting subsequent differences in experiences on mortality is less common14,15,16, and the effects on different age groups and sexes remain poorly understood. This is an important shortcoming, because any long-term differences between captive-born and wild-captured animals are currently not considered in research and conservation programs.The capture of wild animals may have long-term consequences on life-history for three main reasons. First, capture can alter behavior, physiology, and immunity19,20,21 through chronic stress or sustained injuries, leading to reductions in survival rates over the subsequent months or years16,22,23. Second, even brief disruptions to early developmental conditions can cause considerable reductions in later-life health, reproduction and survival24 that can persist for decades in long-lived species25. Third, interactions with humans, taming/breaking, changes in social systems and dynamics, interspecies competition, and social isolation within the captive environment can have further effects on post-capture lifespan26. For example, some wild-captured animals may be subject to differences in management compared to captive-born animals for continued periods following capture, for example, due to differences in behavior27,28,29,30. Finally, there may be pre-existing differences between wild-captured and captive-born animals due to inherent differences (e.g. captured individuals can experience a more natural environment before being captured), selective capture of certain type of animals26,31 and selective survival during and after capture process32.One of the most striking examples of frequent wild-capture still happening today23,33 in a species that often performs poorly in captivity is elephants, yet the long-term effects of capturing elephants are largely unknown. First, compared to wild or semi-captive populations, both African (Loxodonta africana) and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) suffer considerably higher mortality rates in zoos34. However, such comparisons do not reveal the effects of origin per se, but instead illustrate management differences because the diet, social environment, exercise possibilities and disease patterns in zoo populations are vastly different to the wild12,13. For example, although not studied in detail, stress levels of captive elephants are reported to increase when interacting with humans35. Moreover, a lack of multigenerational family groups in most zoos means that the early maternal environment of those born in captivity is typically different from wild-captured animals. This prevents the differentiation of early parental effects36 from capture effects among wild-born and captive-born zoo residents. Different zoos also present heterogeneous living conditions, breeding possibilities and climate, and even small variation in factors such as within-year fluctuations in temperature can double the mortality risk of Asian elephants in range countries37.Second, in Asian captive populations wild-born elephants suffer from increased mortality compared to captive-born individuals (but vice versa in zoos, see discussion for more details)31,34,38 but no studies currently compare the age-specific survival of males and females after capture, the effects of different capture methods, or investigate how long the adverse effects of capture persist for individuals of different ages, sex and capture method. Thus, we lack detailed comparisons of mortality patterns between wild-captured and captive-born individuals that otherwise live in a similar environment with shared food and disease source, similar social interactions and breeding patterns. Unfortunately, such data rarely exist for any species, preventing the comparison of the long-term survival of wild-caught and captive-born animals, despite the urgent need of animal welfare specialists, veterinarians and ecologists to identify such effects for the success of the individuals and consequently populations.Here we take advantage of exceptional studbook data recorded on timber elephants in Myanmar (Burma) by the local government for a century, to demonstrate the adverse age-specific mortality effects of capture from the wild and subsequent taming in a long-lived mammal. Live-capture of wild Asian elephants to replenish captive populations has been practiced for more than 3000 years30,39,40. Consequently, a third (~15,000) of the remaining, endangered global population of Asian elephants now lives in captivity in range countries41 (including captive facilities, temples, private owners and working camps). The largest such captive population exists in Myanmar, with ~5000 captive elephants mainly employed in the timber logging industry41. The capture of wild elephants to supplement the timber elephant population has been performed using three different methods; (i) stockade for whole group, (ii) immobilization by sedation, and (iii) milarshikar (lasso) of chosen individuals (see results and methods for details). Capture is controlled by the government: offtake numbers have varied between 22 and 283 individuals captured per year from 1970–1993, with >2000 individuals captured in total by the government over the 22-year period42, however these values may be underreported43. Few restrictions on capture existed before 1968, but since then a minimum shoulder height of 1.37 m (~5 years age) has been enforced. The immediate mortality rate during the capturing process and taming is unknown to us and not included in our study. However, estimates are high, varying between 5 and 30% or potentially even higher in the same time period depending on the capture method40,42. Although wild-capture in Myanmar was banned in the 90s44, smaller-scale capture primarily focused on individuals involved in human-elephant conflict continues.Here we produce a detailed analysis of the age-specific effects of wild-capture in Myanmar and investigate whether (i) capture increases the mortality risk of elephants compared to captive born individuals, (ii) the effect of capture on mortality depends on the age at capture, (iii) the effect of capture on mortality depends on the time since capture, (iv) there is variation in mortality based on the capture method used, and (v) there is a sex difference in the effect of capture on mortality. Our dataset enables us to answer such questions. First, it includes longitudinal repeated measures of mortality risk for 2930 females over 50,054 elephant-year observations and for 2220 males over 32,972 elephant-year observations. Of these elephants 2072 were wild-captured during 1951–2000 and 3078 were captive-born during 1925–1999. Consequently, the dataset offers a robust sample size to test the effects of capture over entire life-spans. Second, wild-caught and captive-born elephants live, forage and work alongside one another, and the same governmental regulations apply for both types of elephants concerning data recording, workload and rest periods. The elephants are not provisioned, but instead forage unsupervised in forests at night, and the same basic veterinary care is available to all individuals. Their social environment includes genetically related and unrelated animals of both sexes and all ages that they can choose to interact with during nights and free-time unsupervised in the forest, including allomothers and grandmothers known to increase calf survival in the population45,46. Both wild-caught and captive-born elephants undergo taming based on similar principles and methods before entering workforce31,47. Calves born in captivity spend their first 4–5 years in relative freedom unused to human handling and commands, and are then separated from their mother and trained to work. Wild-caught elephants follow similar procedure after capture, but are likely to be exposed to harsher treatment depending on their sex, age and personality. Thus part of the effects between captive-born and wild-caught elephants can be due to differences during taming period. Finally, detailed information exists on the age and time of capture for wild-captured or birth date for captive-born elephants as well as living region for both, enabling us to control for confounding factors such as geographic and temporal variation in living conditions and mortality. Our results demonstrate a considerable cost of capturing elephants from the wild on both their short and long-term mortality, regardless of the capture method used. The practice of capturing elephants for sustaining captive populations is not only detrimental because it reduces wild populations of this endangered species; it also fails to provide a viable solution for sustaining captive populations. The long-term differences between captive-born and wild-captured elephants shown by our study are currently rarely considered in research and conservation programs.We first characterized the general mortality pattern of the studied elephant population, which we used in the following analyses to investigate the effects of capture from the wild on subsequent mortality risk. The elephants followed a typical bathtub age-specific mortality (Fig. 1), with mortality risk being higher at young and old age. To study mortality precisely, we relied on multi-model inference48 based on an extension of Siler’s mortality function49 applied to 83,026 elephant-year observations from 5150 elephants. Our approach accounts for uncertainty in survival of elephants before their capture (left censorship), after their follow up (right censorship) as well as for uncertainty concerning the best model choice (see methods). For elephants aged between 0 and 55 years, maximal mortality was predicted during the first year of life with a mortality rate of 10.74% for males and 8.17% for females (model averaged prediction at age = 0, for the best living region and birth cohort; Supplementary Tables 1–3). Mortality then decreased by half every 2.28 years for males and 2.00 years for females, leading to the lowest mortality rate predicted at 14.07 years for males and 13.95 for females. After that, mortality increased slowly with age and doubled every 10.64 years for males and every 9.05 years for females. In addition to age-varying mortality effects, the Siler’s function contains a parameter that models a mortality term that is independent from age. This was estimated to nearly zero for the birth cohort and living region associated with lowest mortality (i.e., Magway 1960; see Supplementary Tables 1–3). Departure from this ‘optimal condition’ resulted in an increase in yearly mortality of up to 0.83% depending on the region, and up to 0.43% depending on the birth cohort (Supplementary Tables 1–3; note that Fig. 1 represents the most common condition in our dataset—Sagaing 1980—and not Magway 1960). Overall, males showed higher mortality than females at all ages (Fig. 1), resulting in a predicted median lifespan of 30.81 years for males against 44.73 years for females for captive elephants living in ‘optimal conditions’ (Supplementary Table 4). More simple models of the general mortality pattern considering a single type of mortality or no effect of sex showed very poor explanatory power (see models 14–17 in Table 1).Second, we quantified how being captured from the wild between 1951 and 2000 (2072 individuals, born during 1902–1991; Nfemales = 1340, Nmales = 732) modifies the general age-specific mortality pattern in each sex compared to 3078 (Nfemales = 1590, Nmales = 1488) captive-born elephants born during 1925–1999. We found strong evidence that both males and females captured from the wild experienced an increased mortality compared to captive-born elephants. To show this, we estimated parameters precisely describing how capture (or any other effect correlated with it) triggered the mortality rate of elephants to depart from the baseline curve we just described (see Methods). Irrespective of how elephants were captured, we found that capture increased mortality (beyond the known immediate increase in mortality associated with the capture operation itself40,42, which is not included in our dataset). This increase in mortality increased with the age of the elephant at capture (Fig. 2a) and was maximal during the year of capture (Fig. 2b). The best model fit does not consider differences between capture methods (model 10; Table 1) and predicts an increase in mortality in the first year following capture of 2.72% beyond the baseline mortality if the elephant is captured at age 5, 3.19% at age 10, 4.13% at age 20, or 5.99% at age 40. Once captured, the increase in mortality risk decreases with time. Based on our best model fit, we estimate that the excess in mortality associated with being captured reduced by half every 1.92 years. Consequently, the excess mortality per year associated with being captured reduces below 0.1% 9.15 years after capture for those elephants captured at age 5, 9.59 years after capture for those captured at age 10, 10.31 years after capture for those captured at age 20, and 11.33 years after a capture for those captured at age 40. The pace at which the mortality rate of elephants returns to the baseline level the years following capture did not depend noticeably on the elephant age (Supplementary Tables 1–3; note also that black and gray lines are almost parallel in Fig. 2b). Similarly, although males have higher mortality in general (Fig. 1), the sex of elephants seems to exert a negligible influence on the effect size of the mortality increase in the first year following capture and on the long-term recovery time from the effects associated with capture (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 1–3). Together with already very high immediate mortality rates associated with capture operations40,42, our results demonstrate a considerable cost of capturing and taming elephants from the wild.We found some weak evidence that the clear increase in mortality associated with capture and taming actually differs depending on the capture method; this suggests that whichever method was used to capture an elephant had little influence on its survival past the event of capture and that all methods were associated with a similar long-term mortality cost. In our dataset, 378 males and 805 females were captured by a stockade method (trapping all elephants in the same area) during 1951–1999 between ages 1 and 50 (mean ± SD: 14.32 ± 9.43 years; median: 12.00 years); 253 males and 377 females were immobilized using sedatives during 1963–2000 between ages 1 and 51 (mean ± SD: 12.54 ± 9.14 years; median: 9.00 years); and 101 males and 158 females were captured using milarshikar (“lasso”) during 1968–1981 at ages 1–43 (mean ± SD: 9.99 ± 6.25 years; median: 7.00 years) (Fig. 3a, b). Whereas the stockade method is unspecific and generally results in many more adult elephants being captured with extremely high mortality rate during capture and taming period (not assessed in our study but estimated to be 30.1%40), immobilization (9.7% immediate mortality40) and milarshikar (4.6% immediate mortality40) techniques are more targeted. Immobilization is often used to capture elephants that are involved in conflict with people, and milarshikar for targeting young, apparently healthy individuals. Our model comparison reveals an important model selection uncertainty which prevents us from concluding unambiguously about the possible long-term differences between the capture methods in affecting mortality risk. On the one hand, the best model fit did not support any difference between the capture methods in increasing mortality risk (i.e., all were associated with an increased long-term mortality risk). On the other hand, the model with the lowest AIC presents a probability of selection only 1.27 (evidence ratio) times higher than the second best fit (ΔAIC = 0.48), suggesting that a replication of our analysis on another dataset from the same population could lead to a swap in the models fitting the data best and second best (Table 1). This second fit does suggest that the methods of capture influence differentially mortality (Supplementary Tables 2–3). Similar inconclusive results were also obtained by running the analysis as a survival analysis based on logistic regression or as a Cox survival analysis, which we do not present due to the limitation of these alternative approaches when it comes to studying precisely the effect of capture. In any case, model predictions—which we produced by model averaging so to precisely capture this model selection uncertainty—suggest that the different capture methods have relatively similar effects on long-term mortality (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 4). Stockade and immobilization methods of capture appear to have very similar effects for the ages at which most elephants are captured. Milarshikar may lead to a slightly higher increase in mortality in the period following capture than other capture methods (Fig. 2a) but this is also the method for which the recovery after capture is the fastest (Fig. 2b). Again, our data clearly support that all capture methods are associated with increased long-term mortality in both males and females in a similar way (Table 1).To fully assess the influence of capture conditions (captive born or three capture methods) on elephant lifespan, we first predicted the median lifespan of elephants for these different conditions. Irrespective of the capture method, the age at capture, and the sex of the elephant, capture resulted in the reduction of the median lifespan by several years (Supplementary Table 4). Even in the most optimal combination of conditions (5 years old females living at Magway, born in 1960 and captured by milarshikar), the median lifespan was 3.17 years lower than for the captive counterparts. In less favorable conditions, the median lifespan of captured individuals was reduced by more than 7 years. To represent the overall effect of capture on survival, we predicted the probability of survival associated to each single elephant-year observation and averaged them so to obtain a single predicted survivorship curve for each capture method (Fig. 4). These predictions thus also take the individual differences in birth cohort and living region, capture method and age at capture, into account and differ from other predictions used in this paper which studied the effect of some parameters while holding all the others constant. Immobilization, followed by stockade, was the most detrimental method in terms of overall survival in both sexes. However, in agreement with the results presented above, there is very little difference between the capture methods. Instead, the figure shows that the difference between wild-born and captive-born individuals (irrespective of the method of capture) is as pronounced as the general difference in mortality between males and females in elephants.None of the above results presented were confounded by general differences in age between wild-captured and captive-born individuals, capture practices or keeping systems in different logging regions of the country, or across the study period, which were controlled for in all models.Baseline yearly mortality rates of males and females in Myanmar timber elephant population. Lines depict predictions from model averaging of all model fits presented in Table 1. Predictions were made for an average male (black) and female (gray) that would have been born in captivity from the birth cohort 1980 at Sagaing (the time and place accounting for the highest proportion of our data). Other conditions do not impact the general bathtub shape of the mortality function. Dots represent yearly mortality rates for each sex directly computed using raw data without accounting for capture status, birth cohort or living region. The diameter of the dots is proportional to the number of yearly elephant observations (Total = 83,026)Additional mortality related to capture. This panel represents the short-term (a) and long-term (b) increase in mortality following capture for the three capture methods. Lines depict predictions from model averaging of all model fits presented in Table 1. Here, predictions would be identical for different birth cohorts and living regions, and although predictions are here computed for males they are virtually identical for both sexes (not shown). Short-term effect refers to the increase in mortality from the baseline level for the year following capture. This does not consider the immediate mortality during capture which is not recorded in our dataset but it could include effects caused by the taming procedure. Long-term effect refers to the increase in mortality from the baseline level as a function of the time elapsed since capture. We show the long-term effect of capture for an average elephant captured at 5 years old (black) and at 20 years old (gray)Capture frequencies by elephant age at capture and time period differentiating the three capture methods. a The number of 1 to 51-year-old elephants (males and females combined) captured by the immobilization, milarshikar and stockade methods. b The number of captured elephants in our dataset 1951–2000 by the immobilization, milarshikar and stockade methods.

The predicted survival curves for captive-born elephants compared to elephants captured from the wild by immobilization, stockade or milarshikar methods for males (black) and females (gray). Lines depict predictions from model averaging of all model fits presented in Table 1. In contrast to Figs. 1 and 2, here the predictions are adjusted by the age, sex, origin and birth cohort of each observation in the dataset and then averaged by sex and capture method. Again, this does not consider the immediate mortality during capture which is not recorded in our dataset but it could include effects caused by the taming procedure. We used this type of prediction to account for the fact that different capture methods target elephants from different ages. For certain young ages for which no observation was available for a given capture method, we assumed that mortality was identical for such observations as the captive-born elephantsWe took advantage of data available on wild-captured and captive-born Asian elephants in Myanmar to demonstrate the detailed, age-specific, adverse effects of capture from the wild on mortality in Asian elephants. We found that elephants captured from the wild had higher mortality rates than captive-born elephants at all ages. These effects stemming from the consequence of capture and also possibly from differences in how elephants perceived the taming process resulted in the reduction of (median) lifespan by several years. Second, we found that capture effects were more harmful the older the elephant was at the time of capture. Third, we found that the mortality of wild-captured elephants was the highest during the first year of capture decreasing slowly thereafter over the following years. Despite the paucity of research on the effect of capture and taming, higher mortality among wild-captured animals as compared to captive-born has also been reported in some studies with limited sample size on marine mammals50,51 and primates52. In addition, that age increases this mortality cost has also been reported in killer whales51 and in macaques52. We call for more studies of this kind to assess how general the negative effects of capture are across species.The highest mortality increase in the year following capture is likely to be mainly related to capture-related injuries and trauma, as well as the subsequent harsh taming and breaking causing some of the recently captured animals that survived the capture-operation itself to die within a short time after entering captivity. However, in addition to acute stress from capture and training, wild-caught elephants are likely to suffer from chronic stress53, although there are currently no studies directly comparing stress hormone levels or health of wild-captured and captive-born elephants in similar keeping systems. Long-term stress may lead to immune system dysfunction, higher mortality and reduced longevity54 with reduced subsequent fitness53. Such effects of stress are also known to differ according to age55. Acclimation of the elephants to new environment presents challenges: in Myanmar, captured elephants are first broken and then trained to walk with hobbles to restrict their movement while night foraging, and the older the elephants at capture, the more difficult it is to move around with hobbles (to which captive-born individuals are used to after their taming around age 5), which is also likely to restrict their nutritional intake. Also, older elephants take longer to tame than younger elephants and have likely been subjected to harsher taming and breaking process than younger elephants after capture. However, it is noteworthy that in our study population, captive-born elephants, too, go through taming after living comparatively free and unused to human handling and commands for the first five years of life, and similarly to wild-caught elephants, such taming is known to markedly increase their mortality56. Another factor potentially affecting long-term success is competition with locals (or unfamiliar food resources), which was hypothesized to be the reason for wild African elephants translocated to new areas suffering higher long-term mortality and having poorer body condition than elephants of the local population57. Finally, social disruption and defeat may have severe effects after capture for this highly social species with long-term effects on cognition, behavior and survival58. Although capture of very young (under 5 years old) animals is avoided (Fig. 3a), most elephants are captured at a relatively young age, normally when they are still dependent on their mothers, allo-mothers and older herd-mates for protection and guidance, and have not yet attained adult body mass. Such separation from herd-mates early in life is likely to be a powerful adverse experience in elephants59. Nevertheless, our results suggest that it was older rather than younger animals that suffered the most detrimental consequences for their survival following capture.A previous study suggested that the duration of the negative effect of capture on female elephant mortality would last approximately eight years34. Also inter-zoo transfers reduce Asian elephant survivorship in the long-term, an effect detected up to four years after the initial transfer34. Our results extend previous work, and suggest that capture effects depend on the age at capture and may as well slightly depend on the capture method. In all groups, noticeable negative effect on mortality lasts roughly a decade and reduced the median lifespan by several years. Long-term studies on other species monitoring post-capture mortality rates have investigated the mortality consequences only for a relatively short time after capture, with the long-term effects being defined mostly as 30 days to few months after capture, the maximum follow-up duration being five years14,15,16. To our knowledge, there are no comparable studies investigating capture effects on mortality for decades in any species (but see Saraux et al.60 on effects of tagging). However, stress levels after capture and translocation indicate that the long-term adverse effects may indeed continue several months after capture also in other large mammals, such as in zebra for 11–18 weeks61 and rhinoceros for 9 weeks62. In contrast, results from some primates63,64 and carnivores65 suggest that handling, restraint, and confinement may have no effect on well-being, reproduction and longevity of these animals . Further work is warranted to confirm such patterns in different species and conditions.Interestingly, there were little differences between capture methods in neither males nor females, and the recovery rate was similar at all ages. Although the differential effect of the capture methods appears weak, surprisingly, milarshikar presented the highest increase in short-term mortality but this method was also associated with the fastest recovery. Part of this effect may stem from selective disappearance that is known to bias survival estimates in demographic studies32,60,66; different capture methods may focus on individuals that differ in terms of pre-existing trauma e.g., due to previous human-elephant conflict, or in terms of adaptability to captivity and general health. With milarshikar, the captors in Myanmar usually target young animals in good condition, and it may be better suited to selecting the healthiest-looking individuals than other methods such as the stockade that are less discriminate. Furthermore, animals captured by different methods are subject to different levels of mortality during capture operations that are likely to remove the weakest individuals from the sample to different degrees, thus affecting how robust the remaining survivors may be. Finally, given the increased mortality rates following capture, it is feasible that only the most robust wild-captured animals or those more adapted to semi-captivity contribute to older ages. Therefore, accurately assessing the negative effects of capture (or comparing capture methods) on long-term mortality, with the potential initial bias towards capturing individuals in good condition and large (presumably) selective mortality following capture, is challenging. Note however that the taming condition are similar irrespective of the capture method in our population. These challenges aside, our study design benefits from a keeping system in which wild-caught and captive-born elephants are subject to similar veterinary care, taming procedure, access to food, working regulations and data recording that allows us to control for many confounding factors. Furthermore, potential biases in sampling patterns would most likely under-estimate (and not over-estimate) the true negative consequences of capture and taming on elephant survival. Ideally, an evaluation of the safest capture method would include quantitative data on the injuries and fatalities occurring during capture operations40,42, as well as its subsequent consequences on mortality, but only data on the latter were available in this study. The same is true for the taming procedure. These data show convincingly that all capture methods are detrimental both in the short-term or long-term, and capturing and taming wild elephants thus pose a substantial risk on their survival across several years.Although the use of elephants for logging is not a situation that applies to many other populations and species, capture of elephants continues for legal or illegal purposes (for example see ref. 23,33), and capture of various other species from the wild is practiced for diverse purposes each year (for example see ref. 1,2,67). Therefore, our results are timely and have three main implications. First, long-term effects of capture are currently not considered in research design and conservation programs, but our results show that capture and taming can negatively influence animal performance for several years in  elephants. Therefore, using wild-captured animals to supplement medical trial populations  in some species (for example see ref. 68), or as reference groups for species-typical parameter values (for example see ref. 3,4), may lead to erroneous conclusions and both immediate (capture-related) as well as long-term effects of capture should be taken into account in further studies.Second, our results offer interesting comparisons to welfare in zoo collections. In contrast to the situation in our semi-captive Myanmar population, captive(zoo)-born Asian elephants in European zoos have poorer survivorship than wild-captured animals34,38. Although wild-captured female Asian elephants entered zoos at a median estimated age of just 3.4 years, they show better survivorship as adults than zoo-born counterparts. Why do wild-captured individuals fare better than captive-born in zoos, but not in the semi-captive keeping system in Myanmar? Overall, elephants suffer considerably higher mortality rates in zoos when compared to wild or semi-captive populations, such as the timber elephant population studied here34. Indeed, captive-born elephants in the Myanmar population show comparable mortality to wild elephant populations34, and the contrasting performance of wild-captured animals against the captive-born in zoos and timber camps highlights the problems that zoo elephants face. The reasons for the lower performance in zoos should be studied in detail, for instance, the effects of early-life stress and higher nutritional plane of animals, which have been suggested to cause this controversial pattern38. Thus, taken together, rich datasets available for diverse elephants together show that early experience can have profound and sometimes unpredictable effects of wild animals kept in captivity.Finally, ~1000 Asian elephants currently live in captivity in zoos, safari parks, and circuses world-wide12,41, but these populations are not self-sustaining due to high mortality and low fertility rates69. Consequently, 81% of the current European zoo populations were imported from range countries in Asia12 (75% in North America69), 60% being wild-caught and 21% transported from timber camps12. Although capturing elephants from the wild may be sometimes necessary e.g., for conservation, veterinary and anti-poaching activities, similar large-scale wild-capture as in our study population to supplement captive population has occurred also elsewhere in Asia, because these captive populations have insufficient reproductive rates to maintain population sizes43. Captive-born elephants are regarded by keepers as more intelligent, less aggressive, easier to train, tractable and more reliable in temperament than those captured from the wild30. Our study implies that capturing wild individuals in elephants (and potentially among other species with slow life-histories11,50,51,52) is costly for individual longevity and alternative methods should be sought to boost captive populations in order to avoid further capture from endangered wild populations.Ancient Myanmar kings captured and tamed elephants as early as the fifteenth century, primarily for their armies30,40. Since the early eighteenth century, successive Myanmar governments have practiced selective logging of teak using elephant draught power in timber extraction30,40. Today, half of the captive elephants in Myanmar (N ~2700) are government-owned and used in forest camps as riding, transport and draft animals. At night all elephants forage in forests, as part of their family groups unsupervised. Breeding rates are natural and not managed by humans with many captive-born calves thought to be sired by wild bulls, and calves born in captivity are cared for by their biological and allo-mothers45,46.The Myanmar government has monitored their elephant population for over one hundred years, fully recording the life-history of captive timber elephants. Our dataset has been collated from elephant log-books and annual extraction reports archived and maintained by the Myanma Timber Enterprise. The state ownership of thousands of elephants has enabled the recording of the following data for all registered individuals: registration number and name; capture status (wild-caught or captive-born); date of birth; mother’s registration number and name; method and year of capture (if wild-captured); year or age of taming; living region; dates and identities of all calves born; date of death or last known date alive; and cause of death. The individual elephant log-books are maintained by local veterinarians and regional extraction managers in order to check each elephant’s health condition and working ability. While the ages of captive-born elephants are known from precise dates of birth, wild-caught elephants are aged by comparing their height and body condition with captive elephants of known age. The extent of depigmentation (freckles) on trunk, face and temporal areas, and the degree of folding of the upper edge of the ear increase with age, while hairiness of the tail tuft and degree of corrugation or wrinkliness of the skin reduce with increasing age. The Myanmar elephant catchers and trainers take careful consideration of all physical features in estimating age of wild-caught elephants. The error in these estimates is unknown, but is likely to be within a couple of years for young animals that continue to grow70 (under 20), which form the majority (72%) of those captured (N = 1497/2072).Capturing is usually practiced in the cool season by three alternative methods39. First, a stockade method involves driving whole family units or elephants within the same area into a stockade. After capture, one animal at a time is forced out to nearby \"cradles\" designed for taming procedures31. Most elephants captured by stockades are females, including matriarchs, pregnant females, juveniles and mothers with suckling calves, and due to capturing entire families/groups of elephants, the mean capture age is higher than that of the other two methods. Second, an immobilization method has been practiced since 1961 using Etorphine hydrochloride31,39, an opiate-derived narcotic analgesic producing pharmacologic effects similar to those of morphine, which is used in quantities approximating to 1 mg/400 kg. The sedated elephant is tethered and given diprenorphine as a reversal agent at two times the dosage of Etorphine and then dragged to breaking camp by trained elephants. Finally, a milarshikar method involves chasing the chosen wild elephant using trained elephants and noosing them when isolated from the herd, and then dragging them to the camp as above. Those with tusks, suckling calves, or that are pregnant are avoided, and milarshikar is generally not suitable for capturing mature elephants >2.3 m in height because of higher stress and trauma during the capture and breaking procedures.All captured elephants undergo a taming and \"breaking\" procedure immediately after capture (normally at nights to avoid heat stroke) that lasts minimum of one month depending on individual temperament, with older elephants taking longer to tame than younger31 or captive-born individuals47. The taming undoubtedly induces stress for the animal and compromises the welfare, especially during the first few days. Newly caught elephants and 4–5-years-old captive-born calves are first put into crushes (or cradles47). Trainers use food and water as a reward for successful training. Later, trained elephants are brought alongside the crush and fed/handled in view of the captive. During the taming progressing, the elephant is held via the breast band (cradle) or tied to a tree. Elephants commonly resist training and reject food/water for the first few days. Males take longer than females to become tame and are more likely to be traumatized by physical punishment and/or self-inflicted wounds through struggling31. Subsequently, the elephant is trained to respond to verbal commands, such as\"stop\", \"come\" or \"still\". Although captive-born elephants are separated from their mother and tamed at 4–5 years of age using similar methods47, they grow up having regular contact with their maternal herd and to some extent mahouts (riders). Consequently, the wild-captured elephants are likely to go through rougher taming period and are likely to suffer from more stressful psychological and physical trauma during taming31, and the initial adaptation to captivity usually exceeds the one month duration used for captive-born calves. Following the initial adaptation there is a less stressful phase that may last more than 10 years, in which elephants adapt to captivity and their position as subordinates to mahouts31.After taming, elephants are classified as trained calves and assigned permanent individual registration numbers, mahouts and logbooks for recording biodata (sex, temperament, musth, mating, calving, veterinary intervention etc.), and our study utilizes these records (but excludes events and mortality prior to this point). They are used for light work and transport until the age of 17, at which point they are utilized within workload and rest period restrictions set out by government legislation: all state-owned elephants are subject to the same regulations for hours of work/week, working days/year, and tonnage to extract/elephant. For example, in 2010 all mature elephants (17–55 years of age) worked 3–5 days/week, for 5–6 h/day (maximum 8 h), with a maximum extraction rate of 400 tons/year. Working females are given rest from mid-pregnancy (11 months into gestation) until the calves reach their first birthday. Mothers are then used for light duties but allowed to nurse the calves on demand39. Elephants “retire” at 55, but their records are maintained until death.The entire studbook at the time of the analysis included 8006 elephants born (or estimated as born for wild-caught individuals) between 1858 and 2000. Full lifespan is known for 3826 elephants, whilst right-censored lifespan was used for 2975 elephants that were either alive in 2000 or disappeared earlier without an exact date of death. All calves born in 2000 were removed (N = 69) from the analyses, given they were censored under the age of one. Elephants born before 1900 (N = 250) or captured before 1951 (N = 1239) were also excluded because of incomplete records, as were 83 individuals with erroneous death data, 6 calves born with unknown sex and 4 individuals captured older than the maximum age investigated in the survival analysis (≥55 years). The remaining 5150 animals born during 1900–1999 (F = 2930, M = 2220) come from 39 timber extraction areas within 10 of the 14 regions in Myanmar: Chin (N = 21)/Rakhine (N = 148) (joined due to low sample size from Chin), Ayeyarwady (N = 92), Bago (N = 531), Kachin (N = 620), Magway (N = 607), Mandalay (N = 716), Sagaing (N = 1463), Shan (N = 531), Tanintharyi (N = 50) and unknown (N = 371).We used discrete time survival analyses inspired from a logistic regression modeling framework71 and Siler’s survival function49 to investigate the effects of capture on survival until age 55. The approach we used allows: a detailed analysis of the effects of time-dependent variables on the elephant’s probability of dying over discrete time intervals (years); individuals to enter the analyses at varying ages (birth or capture age); and inclusion of data for those individuals with missing exact death date (still alive or disappeared individuals as censored observations), thus avoiding a biased sample towards those dying at a young age or with complete records only. Captive-born elephants were incorporated into the analysis from their birth, and wild-caught elephants from their capture age onwards. This analysis allowed us to estimate the elephant’s risk of dying in each year from age 0 to 55 years, while investigating the effects of capture status or methods and other variables in comparison to captive-born elephants. Survival was investigated until the age of 55 for males and 54 for females, because beyond this age data was insufficient for all capture methods or capture status (the maximum age of death/censoring: captive-born 55 years; stockade 83 years; immobilization 62 years; milarshikar 56 years).We predicted yearly probability of death according to the following non-linear model:This model is an extension from the model introduced by Siler49 to specifically model the effect of covariates on mortality. The first line of the equation is similar to Siler’s original mortality model. The only modification is that we here allow the Siler’s original coefficients (here called w1, b1, w2, b2, and w3) to vary depending on the sex, region and birth cohort of the elephants. Within a given sex, region and birth cohort this part of the model is thus identical to the original formulation. This first equation represents what we call the baseline mortality, that is the mortality not accounting for the effects of capture (although it could be seen as the mortality of captive elephants, the parameters are estimated using information from all elephants, which is why we call it “baseline”). The baseline mortality model is made of 3 components. The first component—called the “mortality for immature animals” in Siler’s paper—models the decrease in mortality rate during early life, the second one—called the “mortality for senescence”—models the increase in mortality rate at old age, and the third one—called the mortality for mature animals—models a constant mortality rate, independent from aging which we thus prefer calling “mortality independent from ageing”. Importantly, all three components contribute to the mortality of elephants at all ages since the mortality is the sum of the three components; only the numerical values vary in a way that gives more weight to a given component at a given age. The original model was introduced by Siler49 to efficiently account for and disentangle these three types of hazards shaping the survival of many organisms. In the particular case for which the “mortality for immature animals” and the “mortality independent from ageing” are null and only “mortality for senescence” is considered, the model reduces to the Gompertz equation72. If only the \"mortality for immature animals\" is null, the model corresponds to the modification of the Gompertz equation71 proposed by Makeham73,74.The baseline mortality rate is thus described by 5 meta-parameters (w1, b1, w2, b2, and w3). We considered that the first four parameters could differ between sexes (subscript “s” in the equation above, 2 levels: males, females). We also considered that the mortality for mature animal (w3) differed between sexes, birth cohort (subscript “t”, 4 levels: 1940, 1960, 1980, 2000) and living region (subscript “l”, 10 levels: unknown, Ayeyarwady, Bago, Kachin, Magway, Mandalay, Rakhine, Sagaing, Shan, Tanintharyi), and we considered that these three sources of variation were additive and did not interact leading to 2 + 4 + 10 = 16 possible values for w3. To fit the most complex model for baseline mortality, one must thus estimate 4 × 2 + 16 = 24 parameter values. We rely on the following half-life metrics to describe age effects: during immaturity the annual mortality rate decreases by half every log(2)/b1 years; during senescence the annual mortality rate doubles every log(2)/b2 years.The second line of the equation describes the effect of capture and taming. The index I is thus equal to 0 for captive-born and 1 for wild-born elephants. Then follows a product between two main terms. The first main term represents the short-term effect of capture. It models the effect at the year of capture. The  mortality increase by w4 for an elephant of age zero, then w5 describes how the effect modeled by w4 changes with the elephant age. If w5 is positive this short-term mortality increases with elephant age, if it is negative the short term effect decreases, and if it is null the short term effect is independent from the elephant’s age. The second main term models how the short-term increase in mortality changes with time since the capture event. The initial mortality cost decreases if b4 is positive, increases if b4 is negative, and it remains constant if b4 is null. The last meta-parameter—b5—models how the elephant age influences the effect of b4: if b5 is positive the effect of b4 increases with age, if b5 is negative it decreases with age and if b5 is null, the elephant age bears no effect of the long-term effect of capture. Each of the 4 coefficients of this second part of the mortality model (w4, w5, b4, and b5) could be considered as null, constant (1 parameter value for each of these 4 meta-parameters), vary according to the sex (2 parameter values for each), or vary according to the capture method (subscript “c” in the equation above; 3 parameter values for each). Only models for which those 4 meta-parameters were considered as null did not account for the effect of capture. All the other parameterizations do account for a possible effect of capture. Hence, meta-parameters w4, w5, b4, and b5 with subscripts “1” and “s” in Table 1 do consider the effect of capture as such but not differences between capture methods. To fit the effect of capture for the most complex model (model 1 in Table 1), one must thus estimate 4 × 3 = 12 parameter values. The most complex model thus contains a total of 36 parameters.We estimated the parameter values by maximum likelihood using R v 3.4.4 (R Core Team, 201775). Specifically, for each year from birth/capture age to 55 years, we coded the mortality of each animal as a binary variable (0 = alive vs. 1 = dead during the observation year), with each animal exiting the analyses at death or last known age alive (censored observations). Given a set of parameters, the mortality model can be used to predict the probability for each observed binary event and the product of these probabilities directly gives the likelihood of the model (as in a classical Bernoulli model)76. One can thus look for the parameter values maximizing such likelihood. We performed such estimation using a bound-constrained optimization by quadratic approximation (BOBYQA77) implemented by the package nloptr 1.0.4, an R interface to the NLopt library78. We assumed that all parameters of the model are positive and did not constrain their upper bound and confirmed that this assumption was correct based on estimation obtained. We approximated the standard errors (SE) on each parameter estimate, for each of the model presented in Table 1, by refitting each model 40 times after resampling the original data at the level of the individuals with replacement (i.e., non-parametric bootstrap). Those SE are presented in Supplementary Table 3.We compared the predictive power79 of 17 different fitted models (Table 1) based on their Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and proceeded to a multi-model inference48. The different models correspond to different biological hypotheses. Models 14–17 (Table 1) consider no effect of sex and no effect of capture. They differ in how mortality is assumed to change with age. The model 16 corresponds to the classical Gompertz mortality model72. All other models considered the effect of sex on the mortality, starting with the model 13 which considers the effect of sex but no effect of capture. Moreover, 3 groups of 4 models were considered to model the effect of capture: one with an effect of capture method on the effect of capture (models 1, 2, 3, 4), one with an effect of sex on the effect of capture (models 5, 6, 7, 8), and one with no effect of sex and capture method on the effect of capture (models 9, 10, 11, 12). Within each group, we consider 4 possible aging effects: an influence of ageing on both short-term and long-term mortality due to capture (models 1, 5, 9), an influence of ageing on short-term mortality only (models 2, 6, 10), no influence of ageing on both short-term and long-term mortality (models 3, 7, 11), and an influence of ageing on long-term mortality only (models 4, 8, 12).To compute estimates accounting for the model selection uncertainty we performed a so-called model averaging by weighting the estimates of all models (Supplementary Table 1) by the AIC weight of each model48. The AIC weights estimate the probability of model selection; that is, the frequency at which a given model would be best across all samples, or equivalently the probability that the best model in a given random sample really is the best model in the population. We computed the weight as suggested by Burnham and Anderson48. We obtained 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the traditional Wald method after deriving the weighted average SE of each estimate following equation 5 in Lukacs et al. 201080. Parameters not estimated for a given model were assumed to be null and were considered as such during the averaging.To assess the influence of each method on elephant lifespan, we used the computation of median lifespans, the minimal age below which half of the individuals are predicted to be dead. We chose not to use full life expectancies because we did not estimate mortality after 55 years and thus predictions for life expectancies would be unreliable. Because our formula (equation 1) bears no simple relationship between hazard and survivorship, we estimated median lifespan numerically from the cumulative products of yearly survival probabilities. We then interpolated between these yearly measurements assuming piecewise constant hazards (i.e., lnS(k + t) = t lnS(k + 1) + (1−t) lnS(k), with k the age in years and t the increments within years).There are no ethical issues related to the demographic data on Asian elephants because it is collected from historical records and no experimental protocols were used in collecting the dataset.The computer code and small subset of data accompanying this study are provided as an R package available from https://github.com/courtiol/SileR.

      "This interview is part of our Road to the IGF series. You can find the rest by clicking here.Randomly-generated starships await to be raided in Suspicious Developments' Heat Signature, a game of dealing with all of the things that can go wrong while doing so. Security guards, futuristic gadgets, and ships blown to pieces can all make for challenging situations to deal with, and the player just has to make do with the hand they're dealt.Gamasutra spoke with Tom Francis of Suspicious Developments to learn about the nuances of creating stressful situations that can pop up for players to deal with, and how having consistent logic helped create some neat potential solutions in the Seamus McNally Grand Prize-nominated title.I used to be a games critic for PC Gamer for 9 years. For the last 3 of those, I started tinkering with Game Maker in my spare time, and made Gunpoint with artist John Roberts, composer Ryan Ike, and 3 others. That sold well enough for me to make indie games full time, and Heat Signature is the first big game I've designed since then.It started with an interview like this, with me on the other side - I was asking Spelunky creator Derek Yu if he thought his chunky level generation could be adapted to 3D. Afterwards, I thought about how I'd approach that, and thought of spaceships as a good type of level where you could destroy any part of it and it'd make sense that there's nothing outside. It was just a pipe dream, I wasn't even a developer at the time, but after Gunpoint I realized I knew enough to make a game like that in 2D. So it sort of came full circle.We used Game Maker Studio 1.4. It's still the fastest tool I know to get something up and working, and I was surprised it let us do things like the seamless galactic zoom without too much hassle.I started it alone in December 2013. Around August 2014, I had enough of the game working that I put out a call for artists and composers, and not coincidentally John Roberts was the best choice for art again. For music I hired John Halpart for the main score, and Christopher James Harvey for a few extra tracks.At the start of 2017 it had been 3 years, and I was itching to finish, so I hired John Winder to help me with the programming side of things. Valve had invited me to co-work from their offices, and John's technical skills plus our chats with Valve led to features like finding your Steam Friends' items in-game.We finally released in September 2017, so 3 years, 9 months. Never again.I think most of it comes from creating rules of the simulation, rather than special cases with a particular intent. So, when you fire a gun, we have that create a noise in a certain radius, and guards investigate suspicious noises. I didn't add that to create a specific scenario, or even to make the game harder or easier. It's just a rule that makes sense, is easy to learn, and applies in all situations.That means it can be a tool: fire to trick a guard into opening a door when he comes to investigate. Or a problem: you can dodge this guard's bullet, but the noise of him firing is going to attract everyone else. Same goes for other rules, like 'a heavy, fast moving object hitting someone will knock them out'. You can throw a concussion hammer at a guard across the room, but equally a grenade that takes out an engineer can send his wrench flying at you hard enough to knock you out cold.I usually find if you make a consistent logical simulation, players create their own catastrophes.The hard work is in building the simulation, and the payoff is that it's then really easy to invent and add cool items. For two and a half years I was mostly just doing the first part, lots of simulation work with only a few boring items like guns. Then, in the last year, I was able to add a flurry of fun gadgets almost as fast as I thought of them.So the Slipstream, a device that slows time and lets you move 5x faster than everyone else, only took a couple of hours to add. We already had variable time-scale, the physics of bullets and movement were already timescale-dependent, so it's just a few lines of code to change that number, and make an exception for the player.Now you can outrun a bullet, and all these other unforeseen consequences happen for free - for example, you can just run through glass. A ship's window is just checking \"OK, we just got hit by heavy object travelling at 20 metres per second, time to break.\" So that trick just works because the physics of it adds up. I didn't even know you could do it until after launch.That was a very happy accident. I do generally want to avoid making my games too skill-based, not least because I'm bad at skill-based games myself, but I hadn't really managed that in Heat Signature until I came to add an inventory screen.This was just to help you change weapons without fumbling for the right key in a tricky situation, and initially it blacked out the whole screen while you picked a weapon. Then I tried only dimming the game world behind the menu, then I tried not dimming it at all, then I tried moving the inventory list out of the way to the side, then I tried letting you aim shots directly from this screen, and suddenly I had more of a strategy game than an action game.I discovered this is a huge win for an open-ended, emergent type game. These games, Heat Signature included, generally allow for loads more interesting solutions than the player has time to consider in the time window when they'd work. A pause-and-play system completely removes that limit, and suddenly the frequency of those story-worthy \"Aha!\" moments exploded.To be honest, this feature was probably a mistake. I think it works as a nice 'last resort' or 'exceptional circumstances' solution, but it was so insanely expensive to make that it probably wasn't worth it. The number of bugs and crashes and extra code complexity in other features that came from the fact that any given part of a ship might just stop existing, that a ship might split into three different ships, was crazy.So, to your question, what it adds to the challenge is fairly minimal, but I think it does add to the fantasy: knowing you *can* hijack a ship and have a space battle in it and blow a piece off and then board that piece. That probably adds more to the excitement of being in this world than it does to the mechanically interesting solutions available to you.I've been playing Into the Breach for a year now, and it's fantastic, even better than FTL. I think I've put in over 100 hours. Would be very happy to lose to that!Visibility is the one we all talk about these days. I think that's sometimes seen as \"How to market my game\" but I don't think that's the hard bit. The hard bit is making something that's more worthy of attention than the other 200 games that came out that week. That bar is rising, and if you don't pass it then the marketing part is impossible. If you do, marketing is still a thing you've gotta put work and thought into, but it's nothing like as hard as passing that bar in the first place.Everyone worries: what if my good game gets drowned out by all the trash that can get on Steam now? But overall sales are up, and it's not the trash they're buying. So, the scarier scenario is: what if my good game gets drowned out by games people like more?",

I was relieved to see the scores were great, and after 3.5 years of work, that was all I wanted to hear: I didn’t want to know what their caveats were.Once I calmed down and read them, though, I was delighted: they were not only very positive, but they told entertaining stories and made intelligent points.

Keys went out to the first 2,000 people to do so, but I’ll also be keeping the testing list active and inviting people to future alphas from there, so you can still get on it now if you haven’t already. Clarification: this says you can still get on the list, not you can still get in on this alpha test. That test is over and there’s no date for the next one.If you’re in the alpha:  Continued28 commentsHello!

That’s partly because I’ve barely touched it since then. I showed the game to developer friends and the press in LA and SF a few weeks ago, and got lots of great input and ideas, but the main thing I came away thinking was: the on-board game needs to be more interesting. And I think better ship interiors are the foundation of that.

Anything that doesn’t work in place of ‘six’ there, like 3.4 or -2, is not natural. They’re kind of ‘numbers you can see’.I’d like to use the term in game design to mean specifically that: numbers you can see. Things that are represented so simply and wholly and countably that you don’t need to display an actual numeric figure to tell the player how much they’re seeing. They can just see.

This is very unfinished, very unoptimised, and time-limited: I will close it down in two weeks and then you won’t have it anymore.

      "Did you play Gunpoint? Gunpoint was very cool, and designer Tom Francis has since been working on another sandbox action game with the sci-fi-themed Heat Signature. The new game will be out September 21, and there are two cool but bizarre promotions in store for launch week.There’s always more to explore on the final frontier with the best space games on PC.The first is an opportunity to have a Steam trading card bearing your name. If you play the game before September 28 and make a brief clip of something interesting happening to you, you might just have the opportunity to be bought and sold for pocket change on the Steam Market. Who could say no to that opportunity? Check out the details here.You’ll also have an opportunity that week to pick up the Everything Gun, a wildly impractical item that inhales objects around you and shoots them out as projectiles. Picking up the item during launch week will unlock it as a potential random drop in perpetuity, but otherwise it’ll be pulled from the game as of September 29.Heat Signature is all about infiltrating enemy spaceships and enjoying all manner of emergent chaos that results. You’ll hack turrets, throw wrenches, or explosively expose enemy guards to the vacuum of space. Or (more likely) you’ll murder yourself in the process. It also enjoyed a bit of apartnership from Valve on its development.ShareClicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.PromotedHow to master Monster Hunter: World’s deep combat system7 reasons you should return to RuneScape and Old School RuneScapeWhy a visit to Monster Hunter: World should be your videogame summer vacation",
      "I first mentioned my love of Heat Signature on Waypoint Radio back in August, and in the time since, it hasn't gotten any less fierce.In it, you play a series of intergalactic fixers who take on risky missions across a tumultuous nebula. I say a \"series\" of characters because every playable character in Heat Sig is procedurally created, with their own equipment, personal goal, and rad name. And I say \"risky\" missions because, well, what else do you call an assassination attempt on a teleporting chief of security attempted in the middle of a warzone?There's so much more, to be honest: Teleporters, grenade launcher, another type of teleporter, airlocks, a third sort of teleporter, swords. Honestly, there are even more teleporters. There are a lot. Learn about all of those and more in our stream of the game, above.Heat Signature is available now.Have thoughts?

Ты возьмешь на себя роль грозного и могущественного колдуна, который захотел создать своё смертельное подземелье, где будут лишаться жизни плохие и надоедливые персонажи. Тебе нужно будет выстраивать большое количество комнат, в которых ты будешь располагать страшные ловушки для своих жертв. Также не забывай выстраивать запутанные коридоры, из которых очень сложно будет найти выход. Не забывай, что территорию требуется охранять, поэтому расставь по всему подземелью своих верных солдат. Стиль игры очень прост, но этим то и заманивает KeeperRL. Каждый раз, начиная новую игру, мир будет полностью меняться, поэтому тебе будет всегда интересно проводить здесь время. Каждый раз всё новые подземелья, существа, комнаты с ловушками и персонажи.

Сыграйте роль злого колдуна и изучите черную магию. Экипируйте своих миньонов и исследуйте мир, убивайте мирных селян и жгите их дома. Постройте свое подземелье, расставьте ловушки и ждите нападения злых героев.  Когда вы берете под контроль ваших миньонов, игра превращается в классическое roguelike с пошаговыми тактическими боями. Вы можете сыграть как за приключенца так и за хранителя подземелья.  Управляйте подземельем.  Вы углубитесь в гору и построите дюжины  комнат, коридоров и ловушек. Ваши миньоны будут тренироваться и делать оружие и броню.  Узники будут замучены. Вы изучите новые технологии, такие как алхимия, мутация животных и магия!   Roguelike механика.  Симуляция мира на очень высоком уровне. Создания используют предметы и зелья со свитками. Это дюжины специальных предметов, заклинаний, атрибутов и специальных атак. Вы можете рубить головы, конечности, ослеплять или травить врагов. Если вы не будете аккуратны с огнем, то можно сжечь лес.  Большие, процедурно сгенерированные карты.  Вашими соседями станут замки, деревни, другие подземелья и специальные локации. Уничтожайте героев, драконов и ведьм для добычи.  Каждая сыгранная игра будет не похожа на предыдущую.

      "The founder of up-and-coming review aggregator OpenCritic has accused rivals Metacritic of using the site’s data without permission.I wonder what scores our list of upcoming PC games will average out at.In a press release sent out today, founderMatthew Enthoven said, “We didn’t know if we should be proud or outraged when we took a look at Metacritic this morning and saw that they had OpenCritic’s review data and information on their site.“On the positive side, we were excited to see another industry giant stand alongside companies such as Insomniac Games, Nvidia and Telltale in presenting OpenCritic as an authority. However, we’re frustrated that we did not receive recognition and have requested that they either credit OpenCritic or begin licensing our API and databases.”Basically, OpenCritic seem to have found a way to more efficiently grab the review data to fill up the site once an embargo lifts. According to Enthoven, Metacritic are just swiping at least some of this data from them, rather than sourcing it from the outlets themselves, without crediting them.“If you can’t see how they copied us, we wouldn’t blame you – we make subtle, near-invisible changes to various review data to tag it using a system we call ‘horsemen’, Enthoven explained. “For example, with PCGamer’s Blood and Wine review, we added a redundant slash after pcgamer.com. With Twinfinite’s review, we capitalized the “W” and “B” in the review URL.“We can’t detail every example as it would give away our tells, but these two are notable: Metacritic’s Blood and Wine page currently has these exact horsemen listed, leading us to believe that they’ve begun sourcing reviews from OpenCritic. These changes don’t interfere with the user experience and are unique to OpenCritic. We checked to make sure that these links did not appear on popular websites such as Neogaf and reddit. We also feel confident in claiming that we listed these URLs first. As with most games, OpenCritic was faster: in this case, three hours faster.”The ‘horsemen’ were built into the system to protect the site’s work, in the same way old cartographers would add fake place to maps and phone books would leave in fake numbers – it’s like a fingerprint for their work, basically.I really like OpenCritic’s setup, as it doesn’t alter scores because they’re not on the /10 scale and it actually credits the critics, going as far as having a page for each one. Mine even has my face on it, it’s great.As Enthoven puts it: “We’re the only aggregator that correctly credits authors in addition to publications. We’re the only aggregator that lets users pick-and-choose their trusted publications. And unlike Metacritic, all of our scores are presented as simple averages with no hidden weightings, using data that can be verified by the public.“As we announced last January, our API alpha is in full swing and will soon shift into beta. We hope that Metacritic and others will consider joining our beta and licensing our API.”I emailed Enthoven to see what the company plans to do about the current situation, to which he responded: “We don’t intend to proceed beyond this statement and the letter that we’ve sent to [Metacritic owners] CBS Interactive. The legal precedents are not in our favor, nor would we want to engage in any legal proceedings. We can think of no faster way to drain funds and lose momentum.“Our intent here was to send a strong message to Metacritic that we are a serious competitor and that we will continue to call them out on practices that don’t advance the industry overall, including sourcing from us without credit.”ShareClicking on links in articles to retailers or publishers may mean we earn a small commission.PromotedHow to master Monster Hunter: World’s deep combat system7 reasons you should return to RuneScape and Old School RuneScapeWhy a visit to Monster Hunter: World should be your videogame summer vacation",
