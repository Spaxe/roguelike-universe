Z.H.P. Unlosing Ranger VS Darkdeath Evilman,
Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon,"There are also some unreleased tracks that can only be heard in the game: While searching for the oracle, Chocobo encounters Raffaello, who had visited the fountain prior to its current state. The boy runs back to the farm, leaving Chocobo to follow him. Near Stella's house, Chocobo overhears Raffaello asking Shirma why he was different from everyone else. After a brief reassurance from the white mage, the boy leaves to play some more. At the farmhouse, Raffaello explains that he feels something evil growing inside of him. Though everyone tries to help his situation, he apologizes and runs away. Shirma chases after him and suddenly collapses. As this happens, the light in the sky suddenly disappears. Stella tells Shirma to rest, but the girl told her that if she goes to sleep, she will have another nightmare. After going to sleep, Chocobo enters the nightmare and defeats it. Afterward, Freja stops by the house and informs the others that the sun has disappeared, suggesting that the oracle of light is losing their power. Stella immediately knows who it is and continues to watch over Shirma's health. Chocobo, on the other hand, finds Raffaello at the town piazza and is able to cheer him up. Cid finishes the airship he has been working on, but it is missing a power source- Timeless Power. He reminds himself that Irma has the item he needs. At this time, Volg, who had been searching for Irma, enters the garage with an idea of where she might be. He leads Chocobo to a strange woman named Amouri, who is enamored to see an adorable bird. After Chocobo restores her memories, it is revealed that Amouri is really Irma, who had lost all memory when she arrived in Lostime. Realizing that she was acting against her personality, she insists that she would prefer to be left alone. Back at the farmhouse, Shirma experiences another nightmare. Once Chocobo clears it, Shirma remembers that she is the Oracle of Light and that she has a sister named Croma. After light returns to Lostime, Shirma takes her staff to the clocktower, knowing that it is actually a missing hand from the face. Once it is back where it belongs, Raffaello is able to open the door to the clocktower. He tells Shirma and Chocobo that he has to go inside, much to his dismay and uncertainty about his future. Chocobo marches in after him. About halfway up the tower, Chocobo encounters Croma again, who, after a battle, informs him that Raffaello is not on Chocobo's side, something he does not believe. Cid and Chocobo meet with Mayor Gale in his house to discuss the events that happened. Mayor Gale explains that the kinder Raffaello is still alive, but has a limited amount of time before he, too, is absorbed by the Destroyer. They could reach the fortress with the airship, but without a power source- Timeless Power, they can do nothing. Irma, overhearing the conversation, gives Cid the treasure, saying that it was payback for being used as a pawn. With Timeless Power in hand, Cid is able to complete the airship. However, Chocobo shoves Cid aside and boards the airship on a mission not to defeat the Destroyer, but to save Raffaello. As Chocobo enters the fortress, Raffaello attempts to fight off the Destroyer's hold over him. Once Chocobo arrives, the Destroyer takes complete control and overwhelms Chocobo until he receives the Oracles' powers and defeats the Destroyer in his true form. With the Destroyer destroyed, Memoria returns to the rest of the world and the Floating Fortress begins to crumble. Upon collapse, Chocobo falls out, only to be saved by Cid's airship piloted by Raffaello, now free of his previous self and as a human child with Croma by his side. As of now, all is at peace, the town has been renamed Foundtime, and Raffaello leaves to parts unknown to atone for his sins. "
FTL: Faster Than Light,"By Daniel Wallace FTL: Faster Than Light is an addictive indie roguelike developed by Subset Games. Following its incredibly successful Kickstarter origins – in which over 1000% of the original $10,000 goal was pledged by over 4,000 backers – the game is now available directly from the game’s website or via Steam. FTL focuses on intergalactic exploration, space ship combat, diplomacy and the difficult roguelike experience. For the uninitiated, roguelikes are games defined by the aforementioned tricky gameplay, randomly generated universes and dreaded permanent death. You are the captain and it is your responsibility to guide your ship, crew and precious cargo to the Federation – all the while piloting through the dangers of space, fighting off pirates and avoiding the Rebel fleet. You will also have the opportunity to forge allegiances with the galaxy’s variety of races; the Rock Men, Engies, Zoltans, Slugs and Mantises, each with their own specific traits and perks. As captain, your crew is relying on you constantly for direction. Who will man the guns? Who will pilot the ship? Should full power go to the engines or the shields? Each of these decisions has their own bonuses when in combat with other ships. For example, assign a crew member to weapons and they will recharge faster after use, meaning you can keep up the pressure with faster attacks. Likewise, keep a crew member in their respective area for long enough and they will eventually be promoted, further increasing these bonuses. This also makes it that much more painful to lose any of your crew. Take one missile too many to your engines and the Engi manning your shields will die, meaning you will have to shuffle around any remaining crew members – and desperately hope for a replacement. When ‘jumping’ into a node your ship may come across another, whose intentions will become clear shortly after. The crew may want to trade, they may even need help (through one of the game’s numerous quests or in the form of a distress call) or they may simply want to destroy you – in which case you will have to deal with them accordingly. FTL’s combat is reliant on both strategy and blind luck; the latter of which can be incredibly maddening at times. Picture the scene: after a long, drawn out battle with a Mantis pirate ship, your ship is bruised but not out for the count, your hull scarred but not destroyed. Your crew fought the fires bravely and did their best to patch up the ship’s systems. You jump to a new node and there’s yet another ship lying in wait. No – wait. That’s no ordinary pirate – this is a behemoth of a ship. Three shields, two missile systems, a pair of lasers and drones ready to tear away your shields and destroy what remains of your hull. In short, you’re in trouble. You target their shields – without them you will be able to slowly take down their weapons and drone systems. Your first volley of shots all miss and the shields are still up. Okay, no big deal, you can get them once the guns are recharged… But you miss again, again and again. Meanwhile, the monstrosity you stumbled into is tearing away at your precious ship that you have guided so carefully until now, every single shot finding its mark. Your crew members start dying from the fires eating away at your ship from the inside and your systems go offline. All hope lost, your ship explodes. Game over. Throughout your journey to the Federation fleet, you will come across a vast variety of multiple choice events. These events can have any number of repercussions depending on the choices you make. One such event sees you coming across a marooned crew member of some long-crashed ship on an isolated planet. You can decide between leaving him/her/it alone on the planet, or offering them a place on your crew. Bring them aboard and you can put them to work. However, what’s to say they are safe? Who knows how long they were left down there? They may have gone mad and attack the moment they are off that rock! The only way to know is to take a gamble. There are also special ‘blue’ options available depending on your crew and how you have equipped your ship. These options will always be far more beneficial than a standard choice, usually offering bonus materials but sometimes even unlocking a new ship. True to its roguelike nature, FTL generates the galaxy randomly every time you play. You may have to travel through nebulae, pirate controlled sectors, each of the race’s homeworlds or some other type of alien space. Each individual sector generates randomly each time, and whilst exploring them there are a number of environmental hazards you may be unfortunate enough to fall foul of. Asteroid fields that will eat away at your ship (and thankfully, any other ship you may be locked in battle with), solar flares that ignite the interiors of any ship foolhardy enough to remain too close and ion storms that cut your ship’s available power in half. These hazards all encourage tactical play – especially the latter – but also generally infuriate; when in an ion storm without sufficient power, you usually have to decide which of your systems to power. Oxygen or shields, engines or drones; either way these fights are usually the trickiest in the game. The most aggravating aspect of ion storms is the apparent immunity given to AI ships inside them. While your own reactor’s power is cut in half the same is never true of the enemy ship, often creating a scenario where a fully shielded hostile ship tears your hull apart with multiple weapons and drones while you struggle to manage your meagre power reserves between oxygen or engines. This is not the only aspect of the game where it can feel as though something is missing. Throughout your journey you will come across a number of stores, each allowing you to trade ‘scrap’ for a variety of goods. Anything from new crew members, new weapons and augmentations that will improve your ship. While you can buy supplies from these vendors, you can only sell a selection of your excess resources. On occasion this can be disappointing, especially when you are only ten scrap short of that awesome upgrade you have been looking for while carrying more missiles than you will ever fire. At first FTL is a surprisingly fun game. You will fail your mission a few times and maybe unlock a new ship. You will learn a few strategies and understand what to prioritise on your journey. Eventually this initial excitement will wear off, probably after your ship is torn apart yet again after falling on the wrong side of the random number generator a few times too many. Fortunately, the game stays interesting through the randomly generated galaxy and by offering new ships to campaign with. For some reason you will still find yourself going back for more, albeit in smaller, more sporadic doses. Eventually you may even win a campaign, and in doing so rediscover that initial excitement. While being far from perfect, FTL remains entertaining for those able to shrug off many, many defeats. 7 OUT OF 10 Leave a comment Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: Connecting to %s © 2009-2013 Martin Mulrooney and Alternative Magazine Online.

Torneko: The Last Hope,
Dungeon of Doom,
Dungeon Hack,"Thursday, Dec  1, 2011 GameSetWatch.com is the alt.video game weblog and sister site of Gamasutra.com. It is dedicated to collecting curious links and media for offbeat and oft-ignored games from consoles old and new, as well as from the digital download, iOS, and indie spaces. Read More November 25, 2009 12:00 PM | I mentioned way back in some of the earliest columns that Rogue's inspiration was likely the hack-and-slash play of old-school D&D mixed with the thinking (if not the actual geomorphs) behind the random dungeon generation tables in the 1st Edition AD&D Dungeon Master's Guide. Perhaps partly due to these roots, Dungeon Hack is actually a fairly good game.  It's not nearly as complex as Nethack, but that fact works in the game's favor as much as argue against it.  However, some superficial aspects of the game may cause one to conclude that it does not deserve to be called by the term 'roguelike.' 'It is strong magic that can point to maps!' The object of Dungeon Hack (explained in a pretty cool, for a DOS game, animated opening cutscene) is to obtain a mystic orb from the bottom of a large dungeon.  Along the way are many monsters, traps, magic items (some of them cursed), tunnels to explore and map, and puzzles to solve.  All of this is per roguelike normal.  We'll come back to those shortly. Monsters roam the halls step-by-step, much like in the later classic Might & Magic games, although in this game they do so in real-time.  So long as the player has seen a square of the dungeon himself, any monsters it contains will appear on the automap as a red dot, a feature which makes both exploring and avoiding trouble much easier. Even though the main view window is a directional, 1st person perspective, and combat relies on the player's facing, the useful automap, the turn-based (though still real-time) movement, the fact that combat does not take place in its own mode but in the same as exploration, and the variety of actions possible during that combat, helps to keep the game's roguelikeness intact. Dungeon Hack solves the problem nicely.  It allows players to select from an extensive roster of pre-made characters that cover all the fantasy archetypes and then some.  It also lets the player make a character using a well-developed creation interface, allowing for extensive rerolling and locking aspects like stats, class, race and alignment,  When one of these things is locked, other items gray out to show incompatible options. How do you want your maze of twisty passages all alike? If this looks daunting to you, keep in mind this screen only appears if the player choses 'custom' on a difficulty selection screen.  Setting Easy either there or here automatically puts all the sliders to their easiest settings.  Setting Medium puts them all in the middle, and Hard puts them all at maximum pain levels.  Notice some of the setting names.  'Water level' means a flooded dungeon level that may appear midway through the dungeon.  On it, the player takes a small amount of damage each turn unless he has some means of water breathing, either by potion, Ioun stone or spell. Magical zones are special regions of the dungeon that have unusual properties, such as anti-magic.  Magical traps means things like statues that periodically emit a burst of magic missiles, which must be evaded through good timing.  Through this screen, many game features a player finds personally annoying can be disabled without changing the rest of the play experience. Note the dungeon seed readout at the bottom.  In this number is encoded both the complete set of options chosen by the player, and a random number seed that can be used to recreate a dungeon at a later time.  This system, combined with the permanent death option (which erases saves when the player's character dies), would actually make tournament play feasible. The special powers of many roguelike monsters can be traced back to similar powers found in the D&D Monster Manuals, and some of them retain those powers in Dungeon Hack.  One monster that has caused a lot of consternation among players is the Living Muck, a pudding-like beast that consumes weapons used against it.  And level-draining undead monsters are so dangerous in this game that a special dungeon generation option exists to disable them.  These powers are what make facing roguelike monsters more than simple bags of statistics, and their inclusion here, in a style of game where monsters are expected to have sharper teeth than in a traditional CRPG, is welcome. The 2nd Edition D&D Class Reunion Fighters must make use of magic items to get through all environmental obstacles, either that or just eat the damage.  They can demolish most low-level monsters with a single hit, though, so it makes sense as a trade-off.  I have yet to try to get one through a water level however; it is possible that the class becomes unplayable at that point. They may also have a backstabbing ability, but I am not sure.  They are a challenging class to play.  As per the RPG archetype, mages are physically weak and have very few hit points, but have magic spells with a wide array of combat and utility applications.  Being a more-or-less by-the-book classic Dungeons & Dragons game, the magic system used in Dungeon Hack is strictly Vancian, that is, you set up camp, decide which spells to memorize, then click rest and they are regained. Under the standard 2nd Edition D&D system, hit points regained through rest were quite low, requiring many days to heal a seriously wounded character.  Dungeon Hack uses this system, and it is startling to see the game report '130 hours' as a typical time to get back to maximum health.  But as a nod to playability, so long as the player doesn't rest too close to a presently-active monster he will almost certainly be able to rest as long as he needs to heal. Since monsters are not a credible limit on healing through rest, the game instead uses the traditional roguelike check on health regaining: a food requirement.  New adventurers begin with two rations, and more are found in the dungeon.  Food actually doesn't seem to decrease much (if at all) through mere exploration; it is almost entirely a check on spell replenishment and healing.  Because of the food consumption needed to regain hit points the normal way, a popular creation choice is to multiclass Cleric. The Environmental Persecution Agency Dudgeons & Drag-ons There are a few weirdnesses that should be addressed.  It is possible to outrun your own thrown items simply by running rapidly down a corridor, and thus get hurt by them.  It sucks to accidentally do this with a thrown potion with a damaging effect.  (Hint: nearly anything can be thrown by dragging it to the view window.)  Many magic items must be used by putting them in your hand and then clicking on the hand, which seems needlessly obtuse even though it does help to keep cursed items, which make it impossible to empty a hand, appropriately troublesome.  (So you know: the Scrying Mirror item, which identifies objects, is used by putting it in one hand, the item you want to identify in the other, then clicking on the hand with the mirror.  Spells are cast by making sure that your spellbook is the only thing held-- it works like a two-handed weapon --then the spell you want to use.  And yet, thieves' picks are used by dragging them over the lock you want to pick.) And the keypad controls make it easy to get mixed up a bit in the heat of a hurried escape, turning your character around when you mean to side-step or vice-versa.  Movement and some actions can be performed easily with the keyboard, but attacks, equipping and item use require the use of the mouse, causing a bit of manual confusion that can be frustrating for a game that isn't actually trying to be an action game. To Be Continued.... Does Dungeon Hack deserve to be called roguelike?  We will have a look at that question soon, when we cover one of the most useful tools for defining roguelike games there is: the Berlin Interpretation.  Next time. Tags: 'pretty cool, for a DOS game, animated opening cutscene' Whats the connection here ? What could possibly stop a DOS game from having a quality intro ? Trivia: Dungeon Hack uses the AESOP game engine; Eye of the Beholder 3 uses it too, though a slightly different version. Also, IIRC, the Dungeon Hack dungeons are generated by an external exe which simply outputs a text-file which in turn is read by the main game... Really?  Maybe I can catch that file during generation and have a look at it.  Thanks, paxed! Hm, my bad, I misremembered; MAZE.EXE outputs binary data blobs (plus one text file) I remember this game!  I recall the Gauntlets of Ogre Strength being kinda game breaking. Obligatory random notes: From the original demo the dungeon generation originally looked like it was much more like your standard roguelike, with pre-built rooms and random generation of paths between them; along with lots of 'empty' space so that even at the end of the level the secret rooms might be missed. By the look of things they must have ran out of time and just went with some sort of flood-fill maze algorithm. There's actually a rather large bug produced by the fact they had a seperate maze generation program to the main game (separated, I presume because the original bytecode interpreted mazegen was too slow). The game has a hard limit of something like 2048 unique object identifiers, so if you had the level generator set to maximum number of dungeon levels, keys, food, items and so forth, you'd run out of stuff around level 17 (from memory). So you'd have locked doors, but no keys to open them. No magic items would be dropped around the place, and so forth. Also I believe the maze algorithm actually built the dungeon from exit to entrance. That way it could place a key-locked door, then record the key in a list so that it could remember to place it later on. This is the reason why you'll find that if you've set keys to 'maximum', you'll find a pile of keys in the first few areas, often three of four right at the stair entrance! It minimises the problems of making a dungeon that was technically incompleteable due to door keys being behind door locks. Though this was still possible if you had a large number of keys being generated. Since there was only a small number of possible varitions, if there were more then one of the same key on the level you could unlock the 'wrong' door with it, leaving one key locked behind it's lock. I only ever saw this once or twice in all my gameplay though, and there was a walk through walls cheat anyway that you could use to get around that. I can't ever recall actually completing the game as anything other then a pure cleric or multi-class cleric-something. Fighters had problems with the lack of identification mirrors and easy healing so they'd chew up all the food even on the more generous settings. Thieves weren't too bad, at least they could identify magic items, but still just went through food like it was going out of style. Mages did get the ability to create food, though this was at a rather high level, and I found the fight-cast-sleep cycle got pretty boring before you got to that stage anyway. Clerics didn't have a problem with non-identified cursed items due to the remove curse spell, had plenty of healing spells so never really needed food (and even then they got create food soon enough anyway!), could wear most of the armour and actually do decent damage with weapons. Not to mention Spiritual Hammer is totally the overkill spell in the game anyway since once you get it you don't use anything else other then a pair of them from then on! :) "

Infinite Space III: Sea of Stars,"19 Comments » The main addition to the randomised worlds could well be the dynamic nature of other denizens of the galaxy, hopefully lending the often static playfields a stronger sense of life. Robust modding support is also planned. Weird Worlds was quite fun, I wish it was a little more complex though. Weird Worlds was indeed awesome. Imagine how much better it could have been if they would have kickstarted it. If it had a little more depth in the exploring and travelling.. Still, I think I’ve played it more than FTL. Heck yes! Weird Worlds was great fun in 15-minute snippets; here’s hoping with a decent budget they can fill out the game to the huge depth it deserves. Awesome, one of my favorite Indie devs! I still fire up Weird Worlds from time to time. i tried to resist the urge to pledge (yeah yeah, i know that was futile, but i did try) but then the vid showed a pic of 2 cats and before i knew it, i was throwing monies at the screen. Loved Strange Adventures and Weird Worlds, so I’m pretty stoked Digital Eel is still out there keeping this sort of thing alive. Wary about the truly 3D space, the combat, the touch screen interface etc, but not wary enough to still my excitement. Digital eels are my favorite kind About time! Yuss, long overdue. Really hope they make it. Hot damn.  If they just make the combat 3 dimensional I won’t need to dream about that combo of Infinite Space and Flotilla anymore. Backing!!! HOORAY! This is 12 on my excite-o-meter, which only goes up to 10. I love how the second tier is limited to 50000 copies. If it had been any other dev, I’d have thought it was a typo. Not familiar with their previous games, but it looks promising, though I must admit I don’t quite understand the gameplay. Is it like a more elaborate Trade Wars? Shrunk-down 4x space strategy? A meta-game about designing game assets? Also, RPS staff: I whitelist your site for the benefit of your ad-serving money schemes, but do you really need so many trackers? Ghostery reports 12 on this page. Not quite a Sea of Trackers, but perhaps a small pond. Strange Adventures in Infinite Space is free. as in free beer, only better. cheers! Thanks, I’ll take a look!

NetHack,"This blog post looks at the current situation, and at the various possibilities for resolving it. One of the most common places to see Unicode output is when rendering the map.  Most NetHack variants now do this, because it's one of the more portable ways of displaying the line-drawing characters which are commonly used for walls. NetHack 4 uses a somewhat different method.  The game core mostly doesn't deal with what map elements look like at all (actually, it is aware of a default ASCII rendering for each tilekey, but the only intended use of this is to draw the map in the dumplog when a character dies).  The game core communicates with the interface in terms of 'API keys' (which have a 1 to 1 correspondence with tilekeys, but are spelled differently for historical NitroHack-related reasons).  The interface translates the API keys to tilekeys, and then looks up the appropriate renderings in the current tileset.  When playing tiles, the tileset will contain tile images; when playing on a terminal (or fake terminal), the tileset will contain Unicode characters together with information on how to draw them (color, background, underlining, etc.). Here's an excerpt from one of the NetHack 4 tileset files: Anyway, the big offender here is the very first character on the farlook output. Here's the output from vanilla NetHack with DECgraphics: Apart from the map, the other place where Unicode might potentially be iuseful is in strings inside the game: character names, fruit names, monster names, and perhaps messages printed by the game (currently NetHack is only officially in English, but the occasional non-ASCII character crops up even in English, e.g. 'naïve'; interestingly, these spellings are dying out in favour of non-accented ones, perhaps due to the use of computers). This is not currently a problem that most variants handle; for example, NetHack 4 currently uses the same text input routines as NitroHack, which disallow non-ASCII characters. When storing the strings in memory, there are three real options, which also affect how easy it is to rewrite string handling functions: There are also some things to watch out for regardless of the encoding used.  For example, the character name is often used as part of the filename, and Unicode in filenames is a pretty nonportable topic in its own right. If you have any comments or suggestions, let me know, either directly via email, or by posting comments on news aggregators that link to this blog post; I'll be looking and responding there, and summarizing the bulk of the sentiment I hear about for the DevTeam.  Perhaps there's some important point that everyone's missing that will make the choice obvious. "
The Binding of Isaac,"There are also 'micro puzzles' which use pickup items (coins, bombs, keys, hearts, cards and pills) to allow the player to acquire special items, gain access to shops/hidden areas, kill enemies and affect the gameplay in other ways. Users playing the 'basic' game who find themselves struggling will be given helper items, whose purpose is to aid the player and make the game easier for them. For players who are doing well, the game will have more challenging bosses, extra chapters, and an overall increase in difficulty. The Fighter The Cleric The Thief The Wizard The Druid The Blue Baby The Berserker Unlocking each character will also unlock their special item as a pickup in the main game regardless of which character is being used. There are also unique familiars that are unlocked by completing the full game with each character. There are several types of items in The Binding of Isaac. Each floor has a random boss that must be fought before moving on to the next level. The Basement, The Caves, The Depths and The Womb each have their own specific bosses. In the Wrath of the Lamb expansion pack, a new alternate floor was added for each existing floor. These are the Cellar, Catacombs, Necropolis, and the Utero, respectively. The final stage of The Depths/Necropolis will always be a fight against Mom. Mom's heart is unlocked after defeating Mom the first time, as well as the Four Horsemen. After beating Mom's heart nine times, it is replaced by It Lives. After beating It Lives once, and thus completing the game 10 times, the level Sheol is unlocked, as well at the new final boss, Satan. Once certain conditions are met, more unlockable bosses can be fought. Every boss has multiple colors that affect their properties and they can also appear in mini-boss rooms, usually with different properties that make them easier. The Seven Deadly sins are bosses that can randomly appear in any shop or secret room. Each of them has a 'Super' version that were added in the Wrath of Lamb expansion pack and Pride has an 'Ultra' version. (Can sometimes be accessed before being always unlocked by having a devil room appear after defeating Mom's Heart.) (Can only be accessed if you have the Polaroid trinket) The Binding of Isaac: The Wrath of the Lamb was announced in January 2012 and was released May 28th on Steam. It includes over 100 new items, more than 20 new enemy types, five new chapters (including two new final bosses), and six additional room types.

Teleglitch,"Dec 11 I don’t know if there’s a name for that type of question that members of the same generation ask each other — things like “Where were you when JFK was shot?” or “when Sputnik went up?” or “when the Wall came down?” — ones that give folks a feel for each other, that establish they’ve lived through the same tragedies and triumphs, like a person’s rough backstory is encapsulated in the answers. I like those questions. Sometimes it’s good to know we come from the same place. I came along too early for my question to be about 9/11 and too late for anything with Cold War flavoring. “Where were you when Clinton was re-elected?” doesn’t have much ring to it, though I can answer it (kitchen). I’m having a hard time thinking of anything else I could use. Oh, maybe Clinton’s impeachment. I was in the kitchen for that too. Where were you when you first played Doom? “It looks so real!” I said as we shot the first zombie grunts. This was, incidentally, before I’d ever heard of zombies. “I know,” she said. She was grinning like she was letting me in on the greatest secret in the world. To us, at our age, maybe she was. I hesitated to ask my next question, but I got it out anyway. “Do you ever feel guilty playing this?” A zombie had just turned into spatter-and-ribs from standing too close to an exploding barrel. My first exploding barrel. She’d shot it — chances were I wouldn’t have figured it out on my own. She shrugged. “Nah. But some of the monsters have bad words in their names — I don’t say those. It tells the names in my dad’s strategy guide. One of them is called the Baron of H.” The damage was done, and weeks later I begged my dad to get me Doom on the Sega Genesis 32X. He went over to my uncle’s to check it out. I remember him asking questions over my uncle’s shoulder while we watched him play. “So why is Doom rated M?” he asked. “Because there’s blood and guts lying around everywhere.” My uncle chainsawed an imp, and those glorious howls filled the room. I winced. I was sure my dad wouldn’t let me go to my uncle’s house anymore, let alone buy this sick filth and have me filling our quiet living room with the howls of split demons. “Can the other monsters hear that?” “They can hear the music too, and they don’t do anything about that.” My dad laughed. Santa got it for me next Christmas. My mom didn’t seem to approve much, and I have no idea what conversations might have taken place outside of my earshot about all the gore that was now broadcast on our living room TV. I was too busy pushing up against walls to find secret rooms to care. Sometimes I’d catch my dad playing it, late at night when I came downstairs for a glass of water. I’d mill around and watch him play until he figured out I was still there and told me to go back to bed. He was better at it than I was — he never made it very far, but only because he played on the second-hardest difficulty, while I was still pussyfooting around on the easier modes. He was clinical about it, counting every bullet and memorizing the position and type of every monster. He mastered strafing long before I ever did. And you know what? I miss that. I miss catching my dad playing my games. I miss Doom. Or at least a remembered version of it, improved and tinted rosy by time and nostalgia and dozens of other games that didn’t measure up. There I was, stranded in some sort of twisted corporate facility, completely lost, and entirely unsure of which dark hallway to explore next. I’d found a massive industrial blast door that I suspected needed its power restored, but I couldn’t figure out where the power control terminal was. Worse, I’d transformed my ordinary pistol into a rapid-firing autopistol, which turned out to be a mistake because I’d burnt through all my 9mm rounds in half as many firefights. Now I was left with a shotgun with a handful of shells and a half-empty revolver. I’d eaten all my preserved meat and drained all my medkits, leaving me with nothing but some empty cans, a couple boxes of nails, some microchips, and a motor in my backpack. Oh, and one bomb that I’d taped some nails to. As bad as things were, they got worse when I opened the next door and two dozen skittering mutants leaped at me. I ran back into the hall, forcing them into the narrow corridor where my shotgun could do its work, but still they came. Nothing left to do, I backed up as far as I could and tossed my nailbomb. The screen shuddered with color like an old TV’s dying tube and my speakers burst with static. When everything was still again, the dozen remaining mutants were in pieces and I was wounded. Still, hope. The bomb had split open part of the wall — a secret! Giddy, I ran inside, and found some more potted meat, which I immediately scarfed down, and another explosive. Some 9mm rounds too, not that those would last more than two seconds. Even so, it was a good find. I took one of my empty cans, filled it with the explosive, and tamped it all in with some nails. Now I had a cangun — a single-use all-wrecking handheld tool of mass destruction. I’d be able to survive at least one more encounter. I found the power switch nearby and went back through the heavy doors with little trouble, but on the other side I was immediately overwhelmed by an ambush from all sides. Tiny zombies scuttled out of pipes in the wall while a larger monster hurled what looked like poo, except it hurt a lot more. No problem — I’ve got a cangun. I ran around and around the room, getting everyone to follow me in a lumbering grunting sweating imitation of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, then sprinted back to the entrance. As everyone closed in for the feast, I turned, can in hand, pulled the wire sticking out the back, and Nothing breathed but me. The room had shaken for an instant, filled with smoke and the blur of heat, and everything was shredded by a hundred nails traveling at a thousand miles an hour. The exit teleporter is in the next room. Safe. That’s Teleglitch. And it’s not only like Doom — it’s better. Oh, there are differences, but they’re the sort that feel just right in the context of a fast-paced survival-horror shooter. The perspective is top-down rather than first-person, though Doom basically existed on a 2D plane anyway, and this way you get to see all the fantastic lighting and line-of-sight mechanics at play. The maps are randomly generated, which can make them a bit wonky and can make the level wildly easier or harder depending on loot and monster placement, but that means you never really lose that sense of displacement, of being an intruder in a foreign and infested place, and every corner or door could have a box of munitions or a shotgun-toting lunatic behind it. Doom didn’t have a crafting system to let you turn your machinegun into a depleted-uranium driver, or illegally modify your grenade launcher to fire five of the sticky bastards, or build a motion detector so you could avoid the pipes where the smallest and most obnoxious mutants live. But it could have, because it fits right in. The goal of the game’s three designers was to create something akin to those older shooters — its plot even feels like a tribute to Doom’s “teleportation experiment gone wrong” backstory — and they’ve succeeded. Nearly everything feels right. It’s tense and terrifying. The setting is alternately lonely and too-crowded. The plot is completely optional. The gunplay is frantic, and the outcome never certain. The visual and audial distortion that accompany combat or performance-enhancing drugs lends added punch and confusion to the combat. Even the game’s mapping system is pitch-perfect, updated as you explore and filled with nifty details like the names of various research wings and security barracks, and sometimes filled with helpful data from terminals, like the locations of loot lockers or the exit teleporter. If I had one complaint, it would be with myself. It’s possible to skip to later levels (templates, really, since they’re randomly created with each play), but only once you’ve completed the level after it — so beating level 4 will let you start on level 3 in later plays. This means that I’ve replayed the early scenes over and over again, and because I’m no longer the same kid, with the same blinding reflexes and unwavering dedication, I suspect I’ll never get to enjoy what the later templates have to offer. Even so, I’ve been having a hell of a time with Teleglitch. It does a great job of capturing what made those old shooters such a joy to play, and even improves on them in some ways. Try it. Be a kid again. Running from a zombie horde. The game’s map. Fighting huge armed mutants while high on stimulants. Corridor shooter. I, too, can vouch for Teleglitch. I played the beta demo a while back and found it lots of fun. Since then it’s only improved. I often feel hunted and harried when playing it, then I’ll find a decent gun, a couple of fistfuls of rounds and maybe the ingredients for a cangun (BOOOOoooOOOOoooOOMM!!!) and then I feel like the avatar of War itself. Then I’ll miss a load of shots, use the cangun on a big mutant and die, quivering, in the corner of some overgrown garden area while a pack of diminutive zombies feast on my still-warm gizzards. I award Teleglitch 17 out of cos{[arccos(A cos α) – arccos(B cos β)]/2}. Would definitely play again. Awesome article. Doom is still the raddest. Truth.

UnReal World,"Although it’s a lesser-known roguelike, UnReal World has garnered a cult following for its complex combat and survival systems, as well as its unique portrayal of Finnish history and mythology. Unlike many dungeon crawlers, UW is extremely open-ended, allowing the player to play a number of non-combat roles such as hunter, hermit, fisherman, or trader. More often than not, the elements are your worst enemy, and understanding how to survive in an Iron Age Finnish wilderness is one of the game’s major challenges. What kind of channel do I have to frequent to stumble upon this kind of game? Looks absolutely awesome Yeah, I love this game. The developers keep to improve it year over year. Such great guys really deserve some of my money. Ah I remember this from a few years ago. Guess I’ll try it now! Very tempting to give it a try! A longer one…I tried it for a couple of minutes, but the walls of text and keyboard controls made it very difficult for me to get into something I’d call a quickstart. Had to realize this obviously requires some amount of time to get familiar with the controls and possibilities. Unfortunately I don’t have enough time… :( I wonder if this game would make a good Android port. I don’t think it would at all ! I find touchscreens clumsy enough for a few directional keys, but I can’t imagine for the quantity of commands this game needs … This game is sweeet!! I played many many many hours when I picked it up first (like 5+ years ago I think). It seems to have come quite some ways since then too! THANK YOU Sami Maaranen and Erkka Lehmus for sharing this gem! Holy moses! Its one of my all time favorite games, and probably the most complex game ever made! They deserve donations more than any other game developer. I hope they can continue the development, or even make another game. Slight fantasy elements from finnish mythology would make me go happy happy joy joy. Agree. In the meantime I managed to play a little more and it turns out to be a quite complex game…Like it a lot!!! The Independent Gaming Source: A community of independent game developers and players. "

Rogue,"An elderly couple who were tricked into letting a rogue builder pave their driveway were mystified when a series of dodgy tradesmen kept calling at their home. The visits took place over five years but the homeowners could not work out why they were being singled out. But now police have the answer – the original builder had left a ‘code’ pattern in the driveway to tip off other cowboy traders that the owners were an easy target. The builder, who massively overcharged them, at £4,000, left the job unfinished in August 2009 but at the centre of the driveway he had placed a squared pattern of different coloured blocks. The residents had not asked for the pattern but thought nothing of it – until other tradesman began calling at their home in Plymstock, Devon, all offering to carry out work which did not need doing. The house calls included four builders offering to re-do the work the original trader had left unfinished. And in November a man told the victims that they were entitled to £14,000 compensation for the poor work but claimed he would need £6,000 in order to release the cash. The couple asked the man to call back – and went straight to the police. Officers are now warning other homeowners to check their driveways for unwanted patterns. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said yesterday: ‘There are grounds to suspect it is there to identify the house as a potential target for these type of offences. ‘Each time the victim has had visitors offering work the men attending have changed. He does not have any details for the men, but states they have been a mixture of English, Romanian and Irish males.’ One of the homeowners, aged 70, said yesterday: ‘We paid for the work to be done, but they never sanded or sealed the driveway. A second lot came along, then another group, then another. I believe the paving symbol, which I didn’t ask for, is a signal for other people to look out for. ‘My concern is they could be targeting other elderly people. There could be some gullible old woman living by herself thinking she has to pay up. I think these people will continue to try their luck with others.’ There have been several instances before of conmen and criminals using a secret code to identify potential victims to each other. The most notorious is the so-called ‘Da Pinchi Code’, where burglars use chalk symbols to let other criminals know whether a property is worth targeting. The marks are made in the pavement by would-be thieves to indicate who lives in a house and whether there is anything worth stealing. One sign in Manchester, in the shape of an open book, says a vulnerable female resident is the occupant. Another symbol of interlocking squares indicates a homeowner who is ‘nervous and afraid’. Since the distinctive pattern was laid, a series of rogue traders have called round the house offering unwanted services A cowboy builder left a coded pattern in the driveway of an elderly couple to let other rogue traders know they were an easy target Police suspect the symbol could be a sign dodgy builders leave to identify a 'potential target' Since the pattern was left on the unfinished driveway in 2009, at least four tradesmen have called round to fix it. One offered to sand the driveway down, something the original builder said he would do. A second trader said he would seal the drive - also something the first workman promised. Next a man offered to do the guttering on the property, before the most recent builder said the couple were due £14,000 compensation for the original builder's shoddy work - but he would need £6,000 upfront first. Other callers are also believed to have offered other work. We are no longer accepting comments on this article.

The Sorcerer's Cave,"Player(s) start by selecting a party from the various encounterable characters in the game. Characters are differentiated by Fighting Strength, Magic Power and various unique abilities. All explorers start on the central 'Gateway' tile, and progress by drawing area tiles (tunnel, chamber, or various special chambers). If the tile is a chamber, the player then draws a number of smaller 'encounter' cards, and must deal with the characters/objects drawn. Encounter cards represent valuables, magical items and characters. Assuming characters are present, the player must either withdraw, attack or approach - in which case a dice roll determines whether characters are neutral, friendly (joining your party) or hostile (prepare for combat). The winning player is the one who escapes the cave with the most treasure. Rules for both solo play and competitive play are given, with several variations on victory conditions offered. "

Dark Cloud,"Today I added two more people to the list of individuals imploring me via e-mail to develop Dark Cloud 3. I'm sorry, folks ,but I'm not going to do it. Since the fall, I've received nine e-mails from people imploring me to make a sequel to Sony's Dark Cloud role-playing game series. Here's a typical e-mail: 'Can you please make a Dark Cloud 3? I have very good memories of that game and its sequel. Many other fans and I would love it if you'd make one. I would preferably ask you to make it for Xbox 360 as well, since I only have a 360 and not a PS3. Thank you.' Another e-mail was even more emphatic. I will quote it in full. Subject line: 'Dark Cloud 3.' Body text: 'Make it.' Some people included the word 'please' in their e-mails. Others did not. But I must admit, no words will sway me. I refuse to make Dark Cloud 3. So, no, I will not make Dark Cloud 3, no matter how you ask. But I do agree that Dark Cloud 2 was pretty good. Advertisement "
Dungeon,"Back in 1996, we released Daggerfall, the second game in The Elder Scrolls series. In just a few months of working here at Bethesda, I’ve come to learn that it is a beloved title for many fans because of its depth and ambitious gameplay. When did you first get into the Elder Scrolls, and when did you first get involved with modding the games? I’ve played all Elder Scrolls games except for Arena. Daggerfall got me involved as no other game before it. I’ve been hooked ever since. As far as modding goes, I took my first steps with the Morrowind Construction Set and released a couple of mods, but I didn’t really get into it before Oblivion. I’d say at least 500 hours in a 5 month arc. Well, I had already released mods involving heavy scripting and weather modifications, but I had to learn all of the Construction Set’s features. I also learned how to create 3d models for the game. I’d say worldspace building and learning 3d modeling were the two most troubling aspects. Oh, and the voice acting, since me and my girlfriend did about 20 english-speaking characters and we’re Italian… As far as smaller issues go, I had hundreds, such as discovering how to make a faction icon appear in-game (trickier than it seems) and so on. I have to say that the modding community helped me out a whole lot in a myriad of situations. Really incredible bunch of people. Probably the most helpful were ScripterRon (Ron Hoffman) and dev_akm (Aubrey K McAuley), the guys responsible for the Tes4Gecko utility. It is really indispensable for making big landscape mods work all the way through. Thanks guys! The quest is quite detailed but not so long, not more than a couple of hours I’d say. The detail went mostly into building this island trying to make it different from everything else in the vanilla game. The quest is fairly different too, and it introduces the storyline I hope to develop in future mods. The quest takes place on Cybiades island, which you can travel to in the Daggerfall game. It was a deserted island then, you’ll see it’s quite livelier now:). I put in quite a few references to the lore and specifically the Daggerfall storyline. There is one surprise that all fans of Daggerfall will surely appreciate. Let’s just say the storyline suggests a link between some of the heroes introduced in various Elder Scrolls games. The landscape. While retaining Oblivion’s graphical qualities, it has a Daggerfall feel somehow. At least that’s how I see it. It is slightly barren and haunting, but that’s exactly how I wanted it to be. There is also a Morrowind touch I think. I tried to flesh out the characters with a distinct personality and some quirky details, and this at the end reminded me of many Morrowind npcs. Yes, I’m about to start working on a dungeon expansion to the island, which should bring the storyline a step forward. Well, I’m caressing the idea of going forward with the Daggerfall theme actually. But what I have in mind may be too much work: I’d like to release a Betony mod, rebuilding the whole island with fully detailed cities, npcs, dungeons, wildlife… For Cybiades I have used almost all the features in the Construction Set, but Betony is quite bigger so I don’t think I would be able to pull it off. No, I’ve done something for some first person shooters years ago but I really am mostly into The Elder Scrolls games. Well, I have to say it would probably be the ideal job for me, I absolutely love it. But I’m Italian and not so young anymore, so it will remain an unrealized dream. Great Work!!! And congratulations from Brazil!!! Thanks guys. Brazil, yeah! I love Kaka! in regards to remaking Daggerfall and even Arena: …those 2 games were made before their time to shine …oh they shined alright but they would dominate today if remade …Morrowind was the first game to be made in the true start of the PC “gamer era” …I think many Elder Scroll fans who never started till Morrowing ,or even Oblivion,  would appreciate being able to experience The Elder Scrolls from the beginning …you might even find new ways to go with future elder scrolls by the refnewed input from players who experience what is to offer in Arena and Daggerfall …I would imagine that many fans who HAVE played daggerfall would enjoy playing it over without the bug problems it once had as well …Please reconsider …look at Arena and Daggerfall for what they could be …a completion to the piece of art that is “Elder Scrolls” for the “gamer era” …with the increase in gamers, they acually WOULD be new games, and a completion to an ongoing masterpiece that has some missing parts Stephen Thanks for the message.  At this time, we don’t have any plans to remake our previous Elder Scrolls games. What are you talking about. If you make Daggerfall again with oblivion graphics it would be great hit. Because name Daggerfall is already branded. People that bought Daggerfall in the past is going to buy Daggerfall again providing that it is vista compatible. You are right though we do need ro stop lingering in the past but there is alot of us out there that just loves the crap out of this game, minus the bugs of course hehe. In fact it has inspired me to become a graphic designer. Thanks to you and your team. Nice going Daniele! I hope you incorperate the diverse skill system from daggerfall as best as possible, it would be fun the climb up the temple of the one (as suggested in a npc dialoge) To the guys at Bethesda, there was something truly magical about Daggerfall, that Morrowind, Oblivion and Fallout 3 simply do not have. Yes, the graphics are better, yes the games are less buggy, but there’s just *something missing*. The weird, haunting music by Eric Heberling really helped too. Seriously, hire him back.

Mission Thunderbolt,"Last night, former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was on ABC News to discuss continuing foreign aid as well as his philanthropy work. During the interview, he was asked about Steve Jobs’s less than kind words about him in Walter Isaacson’s bio: specifically, the part where Jobs (unfairly) says that Bill Gates had no original ideas and got rich just by ripping other people off. Gates’s response is gracious enough. He says that Steve Jobs and he had a long history with each other, and their relationship as colleagues-turned-competitors was complicated, but that he doesn’t fault Steve for anything he said about him. For me, though, the weird part is when Bill Gates says he helped create the original Mac. Maybe Gates doesn’t spend all his time ripping off other people’s ideas, but he sure seems to like ripping off posthumous credit for them. Here’s Gate’s full quote on Steve Jobs: I like Bill Gates a lot, but this sort of comment isn’t exactly proving Steve wrong. Comment » Subscribe to Cult of Mac Share this article A lot of the early software available for the Mac came from Microsoft.  In fact, many Office titles originated on the Mac before being ported to Windows.  So, in a sense, Microsoft helped “create” the Mac Prior to Windows 95, Windows was nothing like the Mac OS.  The Mac OS at that time was completely different.  Based on software created by IBM, which Apple bought it from.  A lot of the early software available for the Mac DIDN’T come from Microsoft.  Apple built their own “Office” apps, and “Paint” apps.  Which was better than Microsofts current (at the time) software.  Microsoft ripped off the Mac OS to create Windows 95, which is the base of all Windows OS up to this day.  The only contribution that Microsoft put into Apple, is 1. The competition, making Apple “think different”, and creating something Microsoft didn’t have.  And 2. They bought $150 million worth of non-voting Apple shares.  This was to help themselves from going under, and at the same time, also helped Apple from going under too.  But to say that Microsoft helped in building/designing the first Macs is way off base. Bill Gates does have a point. If it were up to Steve Jobs alone computers would be purely an upper middle class luxury. Even though there is no doubt in my mind that Apple products provide the best experience, and I am willing to pay for it, I am willing to admit that there is a place for $299 Desktop systems and $329 laptops. That place is in the hands of lower income people who live paycheck to paycheck and for whom computing is not a big priority (i.e. reading the news, Facebooking, and checking e-mail, which is probably like 90% of the computer market today). Imagine if $1,199 was the cheapest full Desktop system you could buy. There would be a whole lot of people who would not have computers in the house or even more people who would not update as frequently (which would limit software innovation). And the $1,199 price tag is only that low because of competitive pressures from lower cost systems. If there was nothing cheaper available, Apple would probably charge a lot more. And then there’s Gary Kildall. I’m with Steve Jobs on this one. This is an unfairly biased attack at Gates. I love macs, could never see myself going to Windows after so many years but I think to accuse Gates of not working to create macs is unfair. Just check your facts… I for one agree with Teds. This is an unfairly biased attack at Gates. What else could Gates do? Al Gore already took credit for inventing the Internet. And this does prove that Gates is a genius. He did, after all, wait until Jobs died so he couldn’t call him out on it. That’s a rather long winded statement that has nothing to do with fact that he DID NOT help create the Mac. All you are arguing that if it wasn’t for Gates then all computers would be more expensive. Which is a ridiculous argument in of itself since it’s something that you really can’t prove. Just because Gates did it first doesn’t mean that it would have never been done. There are PLENTY of cheap Apple product knockoffs. Just look at anything running Android. Well, Gate beat Jobs in this respect: He’s not dead. Also, while the code may have been incompatible, many of the “desktop” paradigms were strikingly similar. The Mac was the first to release a successful computer with a graphical user interface on January 24, 1984, and MS released Windows almost a year later on November 20, 1985. They both featured a GUI with “windows” and a “desktop” with “icons”, etc. I am pretty sure that they both talk about helping each other out when it comes to mac and windows. they both helped each other, this is the video I believe it was in. “Well, Steve, I think there’s more than one way of looking at it.  I think it’s more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had already stolen it”. Don’t feel bad about not knowing these things.  A lot of Apple fanboys tend to base their heart-felt (cult-like) praise for all things Apple (and Jobs) in a skewed version of the truth.  Kinda like Jobs’ “reality distortion field”.  Oh wait…I’m sorry…you might not know what that is.  Read the AUTHORIZED biography and learn about it. Bill gates – world best software guru… Steve jobs – world best salesman… Bill gates was the richest guy in the world for long time and known philanthropist… Steve jobs never belong even in top ten richest guy and known ass hole… STOP IDOLIZING STEVE JOBS… HE WAS AN ARROGANT PRICK… NEVER INVENTED ANYTHING, JUST A GREAT SALESMAN… I never said Bill Gates was the reason computers can be made cheaply, I just said if all we had was Steve Jobs then computers would be expensive. First, Gore really did invent the Internet as we know it today. He carried and won passage for a set of crucial legislation that changed the Internet from a closed system used by government, large corporations, and research universities into something that was commercially viable. One of the main things he changed was the rule against advertising and commercial promotion, originally prohibited on the Internet. Gates’ firm did contribute mightly to the Macintosh, particularly in its early days. Apple did not produce an office suite (Macintosh Office was a Lisa, modified to be a MacXL as a server, a laser printer, and the AppleTalk network, not a set of applications). Apple produced MacWrite and MacPaint. MacWrite was fine for most simple things (in those days, command-s was superscript in those days, not save, and one needed Cassidy & Green’s SpellWrite to have spell checking), but Word was necessary for any complex writing task. Word started as an application called Multi-Tool Word for Xenix systems. It was ported to DOS in 1983 to little success and to the Mac in 1984, to great success. Word for Windows doesn’t appear until 1989, well after the Mac Plus was making great strides. A MacPlus with a 20 meg, SCSI hard drive, armed with Word and PageMaker, along with a laser printer, was a formidable machine in those days. Nothing in the PC world could touch it. Yes, that system was about five, maybe six, grand, but it was vastly cheaper than the type setting equipment it replaced and made possible low-cost, high-end looking materials in about any office. Gates also contributed Excel, a spreadsheet, something Apple greatly lacked. Excel for the Mac appeared in 1985, and the first Windows version doesn’t came out until over two years later in 1987. Without the software from Microsoft, the Mac platform would likely not have survived, let alone thrived. While the Mac mainly made strides in nitches, such as publishing, those were nitches kept the platform alive during some very dark days. Frankly, without Word and Excel, I doubt the Mac could have survived with just PageMaker alone, assuming PageMaker would have been writen for the Mac in those circumstances. If Word for Windows had debuted in 1987, that might have killed the Mac platform. We all rather take for granted the amazing abilities of Word, particularly compared with MacWrite. The only real competitor was WriteNow and it has now been lost to history when it wasn’t ported over to the new PowerPC chip set (strange, really, when one considers the owner of WriteNow was originally Jobs). MacWrite couldn’t even handle footnotes originally. Thus, Word was the word processor choice for students, writers, and anyone with serious work to do. Thank you, Mr. Gates. I don’t know if you intended to help or did so by accident, but you really did contribute to the Mac in greatly positive way. Bill Gates created Windows so you could see the future of technology, but not totally get your hands on it- Steve Jobs put the future of technology in our hands! Seems like a poor attack at Gates. While it’s obvious he did not directly contribute to the engineering of the Mac, he was key in the beginning with providing software. It’s clear he just mispoke and wasn’t trying to take credit for anything. Bill wasn’t very well prepared for this interview, was he… just a perfect answer! Too much LSD will do this to you! Don’t try this at home kids. Actually Xerox’s PARC design centre came up with the GUI Apple used in Mac OS, not IBM. Apple allowed Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a reduced rate, in exchange for 3 days with the PARC designed computer, which used the first mouse to navigate on a “desktop” and used folders and windows rather than a command line. People believe Apple stole the idea, but they clearly had an arrangement with Xerox, who in fact, dropped the idea of making computers because they believed there was no future in it for them. Microsoft were writing software for the new Mac OS, which they had full access to, and hence lifted chunks of code to develop windows 95, which they didn’t have an agreement for. Seeing as Apple hadn’t patented or licensed the OS, they failed when they sued Microsoft for stealing the OS code. Which is why microsoft will never have an original idea, only copy what others have done. Now try to say it without being a total jerk. You’re not completely right either, so don’t sound so self-assured. I’ll let you pick apart your posts for the mistakes, but trust me: they’re there. The reality distortion field exists outside of Apple as well… Casady (not Cassidy) and Greene… Did the original Word have spell checking? Remember, Pagemaker was released before there was really an MS Windows. The version for Windows 2.0 was terrible compared. And crashed a lot! No fonts, no good printers… It was a terrible world, from what I remember. Back in 1987, video graphics on PCs were limited to Hercules mono (the best card at the time), or CGA (YUK!) and EGA (not great either). VGA if you had a PS/2. (I forget when Matrox became a player). Pagemaker would not have done well on those at all. Heck, the Commodore 64 with GEOS was almost a better choice than a PC at that time. (That should be a joke…) At that time, there was no Excel either. It was MultiPlan (Microsoft’s best revenue generator at the time). While I agree that MS may have helped Mac sales, I’m not sure who helped who more. There was no version of Windows that made people want to use it for graphically intensive work at the time, and the PC hardware was a mess of IRQs and bad DOS memory managers, TSRs and drivers. Windows 95 (8 years later) was the first version of Windows to provide real competition for the Mac. I wonder what would have happened had Gary Kildall decided not to play golf when IBM came a callin’… Two words: Macintosh BASIC. Yes, Bill has a right to say they worked together in creating the Mac. See, while the now infamous quote from Gates, about how he went to steal a neighbours (Xerox) TV only to find that Jobs got there first, is true because (and no one knows if Microsoft did visit Xerox and see the Alto in action) graphical interfaces were viewed as the future of computing, it’s undeniable that it was upon seeing the Mac while Microsoft battled ahead with the vastly inferior DOS, that Gates decided he wanted his own version of what was on the Mac. The Alto didn’t inspire both Jobs and Gates, it inspired Jobs first and Mac OS was born. It was then that Mac OS “inspired” Gates, who went on to rip it off while working on software for the Mac. Also, people from that era will remember that while Windows copied Mac OS, it was inferior in it’s presentation, lacking the graphical prowess (overlapping windows, etc) found in Mac OS. As for co-creating the Mac itself? Bullshit, Bill … and he knows it. My heart is shaped like an Apple, and have some different opinions about Mr. Gates. But I got to hand it to him, he took it like a man and I respect him for it. Gates could have decided to be rude or angry but instead he remained calm and relaxed.  I have gained more respect for Gates because he clearly chose to speak positively about Jobs; his composure and positivity tell a lot about Gates’ character. Either his handlers suck, or he doesn’t use any, because he never seems very prepared. He likes to talk about his philanthropic efforts now and everyone always wants to talk to him about Microsoft and many times get gets visibly annoyed by it. Nonsense Mr Gates. You are not able to claim a philosophy or attitude in systems design, meaning innovation! It is similar to a successful innovation vehicle such as BMW where the tire manufacturer are also only a ‘supplier’. Remember also that Gates & Co purchased ‘DOS’ from Nixdorf Computer AG, Germany. Gates further developed and only IBM brought ‘DOS’ to world wide success. remember? Yes, Steve had Bill help him out in the early days of Apple. It’s weird that you don’t know that… being a Mac enthusiast blogger How was I being a jerk? I was merely pointing out where his version of reality was distorted. And yes, while I may not be COMPLETELY right ( I didn’t bother to cite contracts or give explicit details like you did) the gist of what I wrote was correct.  Let’s pick it apart (as you suggested): “The OS was based on software created by XEROX” This is a factual statement.  Is it not? “Microsoft’s office based apps (specifically Excel) were superior to Apple’s, especially in the early days (Apple’s were shit)”. Ok…this could probably be argued as being personal opinion. There are folks out there (Apple fanboys) who feel nothing produced by Jobs and company could ever be shit. It should be noted, however, that God…er…Jobs was enamored with Excel (straight from Isaacson’s book) as it was certainly more robust than the spreadsheet module included with AppleWorks for the Apple II (so much so they didn’t bother porting it to the Macintosh until much later).  In addition, although MacWrite was ok, it was not as good as Word (not by opinion…by the numbers). “Um….no. They both ripped off Xerox” I made this statement in reference to the fact the original “idea” for a GUI interface came as a result of what Jobs and Gates saw at Xerox. Sure, Apple licensed the “idea” from Xerox (Microsoft subsequently licensed it from Apple for Windows) but when Apple faithful distort reality and believe Apple invented it, I say no.  They extend this distortion by saying Microsoft lifted chunks of Apple code to create Windows 95.  Maybe so.  The courts, however, did not agree.  To be clear, both Microsoft and Apple have been guilty of ripping each other off through the years. “Um…no. Microsoft was nowhere near going under” They weren’t. Is the gist of all this not correct? Please point out where I’ve made a mistake. OK, just to make sure I understand the folks agreeing that Bill co-created the Mac with Steve… if I write an app for the iPhone, do I get to say “Steve and I worked together, creating the iPhone”??? “How was I being a jerk?” By inserting snide comments that dismiss your detractors as the “Apple fanboys”, the followers of “God…er…Jobs” or the “Apple faithful”. “‘The OS was based on software created by Xerox’ This is a factual statement. Is it not?” Not entirely. As you admit further down, both Mac OS and Windows were inspired by Xerox. Saying they were based off of it (to me) implies a common code base, which is certainly not the case. Yes, your statement about Apple software being “shit” early on is completely objective. I have no loyalty to Jobs or Apple other than what they have earned. But one could make the argument that Word, Excel and other MS Office programs’ success was directly proportional to the success of the OS as a whole. Or not. There are any number of arguments that can be made once objectivity is thrown out – which is why objectivity SHOULDN’T be thrown out. “Um…no. They both ripped off Xerox.” Again, this implies foul play by Apple and MS, which wasn’t the case. It may not have been an idea that originated at Apple, but it was all above board. And if I may be allowed a colloquialism, Audre Lorde once said, “There are no new ideas. There are only new ways of making them felt.” Xerox didn’t have the original idea either – everyone is inspired by something. The original mouse was pioneered by Doug Englebert in the 1960s, and the original GUI by Ivan Sutherland (also in the early 1960s). These men in turn were inspired by others with “original” ideas. “Um…no. Microsoft was nowhere near going under”. No, they weren’t. You were quite right. Mistakes are relative, as are truths. Your mistake was in being so absolute that you painted yourself into a corner. sir1jaguar… Likes to use a lot of periods… After each statement… Not really sure why… Guess he likes them a lot… Ah, yes, Casady & Greene. They were a wonderful company back in the day. They had a spreadsheet program, fonts, games, you name it. They were so inventive and creative. I really miss them. I don’t know if the Multi-Tool Word version had a spell check, but the first Macintosh version did. For its day, Word was surprisingly sophisticated. I agree PageMaker really didn’t have any choice but the Mac platform, given its visual representation of a page (the most radical use of WYSIWYG at the time). I can still remember discovering Times was substituted for New York when something printed and all the trouble that caused me until I figured it out (yes, that substitution was clearly noted in the documentation). Still, I could do things with PageMaker that were noithing short of remarkable. Still, I am not sure PageMaker alone could have saved the Mac. Even then, PageMaker imported text and most things were written in Word at the professional level. If anything, Word spured on MacWrite and WriteNow. Excel for Mac comes out in September of 1987 and was a big hit from the start. With PageMaker and Excel only really available on the Mac in 1987, 88, and most of 89 (Excel for Windows comes out in December of 89), I think the Microsoft products gave the Mac a big advantage back in those days. Keeping them available on the Mac back in the Dark Days of the early 90s I think saved the platform and the company. Thus, I think Gates can legitimately claim he “did key software” for the Mac and those products did help in very positive ways create the Mac as we know it today. If you write an app that turns the iPhone from an interesting curiosity into a viable platform, an app so useful and widespread it helps define the platform, and then, when the iPhone is having trouble competing, you keep producing great updates for the iPhone so the Apple can fix the problems, then, yes, I think you helped co-create. Fortunately, the iPhone didn’t need that and it didn’t happen. I think we can say VisaCalc helped create the Apple II. I think your point is that Visicalc is one of the applications that helped make the Mac popular and successful, and that allows Visicalc’s developer to claim the title of creator of the Mac. Wow, that opens a whole new world to me as a “creator”. But why stop with “hey I wrote an app for the thing you made, so that makes me a creator of the thing you made”? For example, what really made the Macintosh a success was all of the users who bought and used one. I was one of those people. Ergo, I am also a creator of the Mac…!!?? And I didn’t even use Visicalc. “By inserting snide comments that dismiss your detractors as the “Apple fanboys”, the followers of “God…er…Jobs” or the “Apple faithful”.” I see nothing snide about those comments nor the context in which I made them.  In fact, I was being quite direct about what I feel accurately describes a person who can blindly dispense with the truth and state things as fact, with little or no research.  Is this not what “fanboys” do?  Is this not what Eric27 did? Take a look at some of the other comments here.  Have any trouble discerning who’s who? And no…I don’t dismiss all detractors as “Apple fanboys”.  You’re kind of a detractor. I don’t consider you a fanboy (despite your avatar and username).  Why?  Because you’ve obviously done your homework. “Saying they were based off of it (to me) implies a common code base, which is certainly not the case.” Oh come on…you’re reaching here.  You know damn well I wasn’t trying to imply they were from a common code base.  Geez…the thought never even entered my mind.  I was simply pointing out to Eric27 it was Xerox (not IBM) he should have been referring to.  You inferred incorrectly here, sir. “Yes, your statement about Apple software being “shit” early on is completely objective.” Never felt cornered.  Always felt as though I was in the middle of the ring, going toe to toe. Umm, my point is either Word & Excel helped make the Mac platform, or Visicalc made the Apple II platform. As far as i know, Visicalc was never released for the Mac platform. Do I think the definition of “create” is expansive enough to include those not on the Mac128 development team, yes. Do I think users had much to do with the creating the Mac. Yes, I would argue we did, but our individual contributions are hard to trace. The contributions of Bill Gates are relatively obvious, as are those of Jeremy Jaech, Mark Sundstrom, Mike Templeman, Dave Walter, and Paul Brainerd (the PageMaker team); Spec Bowers, Alan Albert, Dan Chadwick, Jega Arulpragasam (from Wang, who are the core who gave us FileMaker);  John Warnock and Charles Geschke (who gave us PostScript);  Gary Starkweather (who gave us the laser printer);  Hartmut Esslinger,  Andreas Haug, and Georg Spreng (founders of Frog Design, who, along with Steve, made great industrial design a part of Apple all the way back to the Apple IIc);  David Bunnell and Andrew Fluegelman (who gave us MacWorld); and, of course, Steve Jobs. Jobs didn’t invent them Mac on his own, nor was it solely his vision. There was a whole team at Apple that made the Mac. Does anyone want to write Jobs contributed more than  Jef Raskin (who was working on the Mac well before Jobs was), Bill Atkinson, Burrell Smith, Andy Hertzfeld, Guy Kawasaki, or Bud Tribble? If Jaech said he’d help create the Mac with his PageMaker software, would anyone challenge him? If Starkweather claimed the laser printer helped create the Mac, who would disagree? Touché. Well reasoned and (mostly) snark-free. I’m definitely not a fanboy (my name AND avatar are actually intended to promote my stance on platform agnosticism – “mac ” and “google” combined). It was a reach to claim you were implying a common codebase, although that was my initial impression when I first read your comment. Oho, a bit of snark there – you can call him whatever you want. Mr. Jobs, Steve-O or borderline sociopathic nut-job. You’re not going to offend me, as long as you can back up why you label him that. My point was not that they invented it, but that no one can truly claim to be the author of a completely original idea – all are based off of inspiration and precedent. Fanboys DO cut a lot of corners and say he “invented” the mouse, the GUI, etc when it would be more accurate to say he refined these paradigms to where they were accessible and then popularized them. Again, touché. Your corner might not be as inescapable as I first thought. We don’t disagree near as much as either of us initially thought. Cheers! I respect your position. I just disagree with it. Not necessarily any of the individual points, but rather the whole of your argument that the Mac (or the Apple II, or the iPhone, or Windows, or MSDOS, or the Zune) was “created” by anyone who happened to write a successful application for the platform. My example of how I helped create the Mac because I owned one was sarcasm (I also owned an Apple II, so my list of contributions to the computing world is expanding during our back and forth). As for the team that did create the original Mac, Kudos! I still have  the old mac with everyone’s signature molded into the case. Yes, these endeavors are almost always the work of more than one person. And even when it’s mostly just one person, that person is standing the shoulders of giants. When I look at the amazing technology we hold in our hands, I don’t look at it as the achievement of just one person, or one company, or even one industry. It’s culmination of what started with some guy in a cave who thought fire was pretty nifty. But to try and twist all that to say that Bill is the creator of the Mac is just plain silly. IMHO. I absolutely agree we stand on the shoulders of giants and  the technology available today is nothing short of amazing. I am old enough to have used punch cards and was dizzy with joy for getting access to a computer with them, so all that I have now makes me feel like I live in a sci-fi adventure novel sometimes. Fire is a rather nifty thing. I don’t think Bill created the Mac, but was a significant contributor to it. I think he had more programers writing more good stuff for the Mac almost anyone save Apple. You know the old saying, victory has many parents, while failure is an orphan. The Mac has been triumphant, converting essentially everyone to GUI, even its opponents. I give Steve the most credit, but I say Uncle Bill put in a pixel or two. Well said, and we end this discussion in agreement :) My original (and only) beef was with the comments that seemed too eager to grant co-creator status to Bill. It just seemed to lower the bar a bit too much – not unlike how nowadays they give trophies to every kid on every team. I remember in my day, we used to… OK, I’ll save that for another thread. Casady & Greene was a nice little company… Good people, and great software. Strange that it was in Salinas (well, close) and not in Silicon Valley. Then again, Digital research was in Monterey. I wish there was an iPad port of Mission Thunderbolt. (Calhoun, you listening?) Seems I got some dates wrong regarding Excel. It was ’85 when it was released for Mac. I thought it was later. I agree, PM was not enough to save Apple, and MS continuing to make Word and Excel for Mac was certainly helpful. That price issue was always the real killer. $5000+ for a Mac, vs $999 for a basic PC, and about $2500 for a good one. The Mac was a great machine, but most could not justify the cost. And the accessories… Windows added to a PC was a no-brainer, and I’m sure most copies of Windows 3.1 were pirated :-) Nobody can deny that BG and MS made great software for the first Mac. He and his company had the experience, and they had worked with Apple to create Apple II Basic (Woz just wouldn’t do floating point…??), so having them create the first Mac software was a natural choice. Whether it can be said that he helped “create” the Mac… That’s debatable. My god. Mmm… reading “Steve Jobs” by Walter Isaacson I found the following quote referring to Bil Gates: “We did the Mac together” Jobs said. “How did that work for you? Very well. Now we’re going to do this together and this is going to be great.” This was in reference to Steve Jobs pitching Bill Gates to get involved with his new company NeXT. From the founder of Apple himself, it seems like the case is closed. This week's most... Read our latest... "
Sword of Fargoal,"Some background information about Sword of Fargoal, this is not Final Fantasy 12 or anything of the sort, SoF is oldschool to the point that many of you that watch the MC #40 will probably be turned off by it (which would be a bad thing).  What is so great about a game that literally has no animation for the characters on the screen?  Barely any sound effects and very sparse graphics that make you wonder why they aren’t better probably won’t change your mind.  If, that is a big if, you give SoF a chance though, let it take you by the imagination you will be rewarded many times over.  SoF is an RPG of sorts, you have creatures to fight, gold and other loot to pick up and this really powerful sword at the bottom of this dungeon you are attempting to delve into deeper and deeper (SoF is similar to Rogue and other games). The graphics being bare leaves quite a bit to the imagination of the gamer which will help players get sucked in even more.  Along the top of the screen of the original SoF game is your player information, hit points, experience points and amount of gold acquired.  This area also acts as the status bar, when you fight a creature, it’s type will be shown here, when you find loot, it is listed here too.  When you start a level, you are presented with very little other than a screen that is all shaded in and this small area around your character that you can see.  Moving around the dungeon will reveal more of the level, just be careful, there are monsters in that darkness (and lots of loot and the rest of the game). This episode of Matt Chat features gameplay footage of the Commodore Vic-20, Commodore 64, PC remake and even the iPhone release (don’t get your hopes up, the graphics are understandably kept simple, though dated). The other great thing about this episode is that Jeff McCord did an interview with Matt and reveals some very interesting tidbits about SoF, his early programming career and how he survived in Palo Alto early on. If you want to find out more about the wonderful game of Sword of Fargoal then definitely check out Matt Chat #40, opportunities to hear from the creator of a game like this don’t come around often.  To Jeff McCord, you rock. "

Smart Kobold,"My top three recommendations come first, the rest are in no particular order. The game itself is well designed, with a simple but effective story.  You begin weak, and have to pay the village healers extortionate prices whenever you get hurt.  If you have enough money you can also get broken equipment that you find repaired.  However the game really changes pace when you start to discover magic spells, each of which has a profound effect on this pattern of play.  The ending is clever and made me think. Overall it seems Jeff has taken a break from his pattern of highly original roguelikes, instead choosing   to apply his accumulated knowledge and focus on making this year's entry as fun as possible.  In my opinion, he has succeeded. The thing that really makes this game special is that you can't die - the game prevents you from making any move that leads to immediate death (even if you have no way of knowing that's the case - due to chance or a danger you haven't seen yet).  Gameplay varies between a traditional roguelike and a puzzle where you're planning each move carefully.  Overall I found it to be a good little challenge. I enjoyed playing, but was almost put off by the difficulty.  This game punishes you when you make a mistake, and you should expect to die frequently at first ... especially if you don't read the README. I played the game online, and found it easy to get into with a clear and helpful interface.  The detail of the setting drew me in, as did the AI which appeared to be reasonably sophisticated.  Combat was  straightforward.  However the game was let down by technical difficulties - I experienced two crashes,  and numerous times the game slowed down badly when there were lots of monsters about. The game has quite a range of items, sadly let down by a fiddly inventory system.  Other than that it kept me amused for a while, though I was never really sure what the goal was.  My favourite bit was being told a monster had destroyed my trousers! What I did see was promising, it evoked the feeling of being in a cave full of creepy crawlies, worrying about my fading light and dwindling health. My one complaint is that the game becomes sluggish after I've been on the same level for a while.  Apart from that it's quite polished, and even features a mini map. Finding it a bit much, I decided to focus on just a few elements to begin with.  I chose healing, arcane and earth and was soon blasting bolts of rocky death and curing myself when I got hurt.  Having mastered that I began to dabble with fire and cold as well.  This was quite a lot of fun.  I can't help but feel the game would be better if it had some kind of unlocking system, rather than giving you all 10 elements up front, and it would definitely benefit from more intuitive controls.

Tower of Guns,"It is a tower though, and there are definitely guns involved. Most of them are automated, mechanised and pointing at whichever body part you consider to be your tenderest. If only there were some method of fighting back at your disposal. Oh wait, there is! Using other, different guns. First-Person Shooter plus Roguelike. You get a different tale every time you restart, though repeats will begin to creep in around your tenth attempt. It’s a loose framework around which to hang the reason for your escapades, but like a good short story each one sketches just enough detail to serve its purpose. Like those games of yesteryear, there are secrets to be found in obscure locations. I’m talking “this part of the wall looks identical to the others, oh wait it’s transparent and there’s stuff behind” obscure. Most of the time you only carry one weapon (chosen at the start,) but it’s possible to find outlandish secondaries in hidden levels or locations. The Roguelike aspect isn’t just restricted to repeating, randomised levels and regular death. It’s also present in the perk system and the kind of pick-ups you can grab on each attempt to scale the tower. At the start of the game you can only opt for a triple-jump ability or the negation of fall damage, but as you progress and achieve various feats of heroism (or fragility) more perks become available. Things like increased speed for an armour trade-off, or the “Too Young To Die” easy mode (unlocked after a damage threshold has been reached) which gives you a huge advantage against basically everything. New guns unlock in much the same way. You start off with a pair of slightly rubbish ones, and end up with access to rat-a-tat laser rifles and a hand cannon that can compete with your foes in the comedy oversized shell stakes. Blowing up enemies makes them scatter delicious collectable items all over the floor, including blue shards that can power your weapon up to more impressive levels. Taking damage will reduce that power level, so there’s an incentive to stop and destroy things rather than just attempting to duck and weave masterfully through every location. Especially since each level ends with an imposing boss encounter. Problem is, the guns feel a bit wimpy. I’m not someone who has any interest in weapon authenticity, and intense talk about the FEEL and IMPACT of guns in games honestly gets a bit disturbing. But even I can tell that the plop-plop of bullets against enemies who flash for a bit and then vanish with a canned explosion is a bit dissatisfying. While dancing around enemy bullets is intense, besting them with your own firepower doesn’t feel as triumphant as it should. These guys just want to be your friends. Violent, explosive friends. For example, at the moment I’m being guided by a plucky robot with a toupee. And sometimes you’ll end up someplace REALLY WEIRD. Hot tip: Try circle strafing. Yes, I’m playing on easy mode here.

Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space,"Your journey is all about exploring, and the star systems are randomly generated each time you play, meaning that the game can potentially provide endless enjoyment. Discovering new items and events that you hadn’t found before is really entertaining, while taking down hordes of baddies against all odds provides plenty of thrilling action. A number of key elements have been expanded on since the last game, adding to the content and providing more customisation options. There are now traders to be found on planets who will swap items they have on sale for spoils from your cargo. Far more items and events have also been added to the roster, while you’ve now got the ability to alter how many years your journey lasts. Games can play out between 15-45 minutes, depending on your chosen options. The timescale during play is also quite an issue – you’re given far more time to complete your journey in this sequel, even when you’ve set it to 10 years. While it’s great that we now have the option to set the time limit, 10 years is in fact the minimum, and we would have liked to have set it even lower than this and created that great sense of urgency from the original game.

I would play SAO so hard. (I would actually prefer to be held inside the game because it gives you a way better experience that way, but hey there are people who value their real lives after all) i would rather live in the game then the real world, they better make the technology  we need to play the game ASAP. i realy bad want to play the game like it is in the anime were u could move around using ur mind. i would love that very much…. please let me play too!! make a website and and get donation from people will we really die though if my mom or sister ever attempted to remove the game from my head or something?? ;-; It’s not as connected as you think. I haven’t actually come across any current tech that can actually put your mind into a game. So I am pretty confident when I say your mom can pull on your helmet anytime she needs you to take out the trash or come down to the dinner table. Have a button on the helmet that sends a message to the person wearing it, that says something like, “Someone IRL Is Trying To Contact You.” but if he pulls it of , it’s all the more impressive it would actually be possible not to harm a person if you don’t stop the impulses that come from the brainstem, that way all the automated things our body does would still work (our heart beatings, our breathing and such). Ha its good to dream :p Not using sleep-mode/dreaming state/REM for a thing like this would most likely cause harm to your nerves. to play sao you would need to do a surgery + take drugs not necessarily, when you are dreaming (most people) don’t move around. (sleep walkers) so as me and ixozuxiz mentioned, it would solve that problem. although you are right about the surgery that could change in the next few years No, there is already a system that blocks motor impulses from your brain to your body, it is calle Sistema Reticular Ascendente, (don’t know name in english) ant that neuronal system is the reason why you don´t stand up and walk while dreaming, also you don’t need to do any surgery, you only have to realize how to interfer with that system via an external electrodo, and somehow I feel that is actually the easy part, the hard one is going to be to simulate a whole new world in your brain. oops i should have checked lower on the posts. im glad i wasn’t the only one who thought of this. Only problem, DMT is a heavily scheduled hallucinogenic tryptamine all across the world (excluding Brazil in the form of ayahuasca) if you can get those laws changed you could do this. Effects are very short lived unless constantly injected. Tolerance builds up rapidly. Those are a few problems with that method… :/ you cant really control any thing will you sleep it would be impossible to put us in a dream stasis Not impossible just inprobable Majority of the public is uncomfortable with medical use in gaming. But it may be possible to push the body into a chosen state through proper stimulation. yeah i agree above me, i heard/see from youtube videos of and invented mind drawing i supposed. he can draw from the computer using his mind. i believed that will be the first step until we reach the technology from SAO. if someone wants to create it i would be happy to join/work, i believe in my knowledge and peoples knowledge. this will be the first step of it. just contact me in this no. 09263090594 phil. area. Hey mackens What state do you live in I might be able to hire you because I have discovered a way to do almost everything except the game part and my friend works for Microsoft so all I need is an extra hand. The best part of my studies is that I dont need to mess with the brain. I send a syndro-cell (my new nucleus I invented) signals to send to the nucleus which causes a chain reaction and changes the five senses to see, feel, and smell the projection linked to the syndro-cells. I haven’t discovered the taste part though sadly. What’s your email too? what your saying makes no sense a simple nucleus would have no relation to anything that is needed to accomplish what we want unless your simply trying to state that your trying to say that you would take that and replicate something for a analog in game but still what your saying makes no sense you don’t need to recreate anything at all ( if that’s what your implying ) of course you would ( like in the anime ) need to emulate all the feelings tastes and sound but that’s really easy compared to the rest of the project you can’t have two off the same impulses over lay each other and how would you control this replicated analog all you need to do is take the electrical out put signals from the cerebellum and overlay them in game on top of a analog while not messing with core motor functions and allowing them to stay passively active irl one more thing you don’t invent a cell you discover or find ( inventing a cell sure that seems right ha ) If someone actually makes a Nerve Gear, I will like love them forever Worshiped as God Brilliant that would work perfectly the taste wouldnt matter i dont see any problem with it not being able to taste it would be nice but hey Every game can come with a flavor cartridge that can plug into the helmet. It runs the flavor of the virtual object down to a strip that lays over your tongue (Strip hooks to two or more selected teeth and lays over tongue) Now you can play with your bread and taste it too. ‘Just don’t bite your tongue! Hahaha! Personally I’d want him to find out how to input tastes, for true VR I’d want all five senses. I’m curious about this new Syndro-Cell…any chance you could explain it further? I didn’t find anything of it on Google… hope they create it before i die This is completely irrelevant but just for a laugh, wouldn’t you put 0118 999 881 999 119 725 3 as you phone number instead… …Why? Actually you wouldn’t need to stop the signals from the brain to the body, just dull them enough so that the body won’t react to the point where it seems that it doesn’t react at all. If you dull and redirect the signals, and the system is sensitive enough to react to the electrical impulses, it could work. Though it would probably need some type of life support or log out alarm as a safety measure. Idea, on the safety measures thing, have a thing in the helmet the contacts the paramedics if you’re brainwaves come to a complete halt. really only thing is that you would already be dead and they would show up to a dead body but good concept doing that might accidentally stop the more important functions such as breathing. i think if you induced a dreaming state and then just controlled the dreams to be the game that would solve the need for a safety measure but i’d still put one there just in case. also the technology for “mind controlled gaming” already exists. i did a paper on future user interfaces for computers and found some really cool stuff. Actually an induced sleep paralysis would work and they have already done a lot of research into what causes that, not that there aren’t enough other issues to overcome. it is almost impossible to control dreams and you cant really do anything inside a dream think about it Not really :/ actully if you have the right amount of focus and will when entering sleepmode you will not control your physical body but your dreamself this being the virtual body allowing you to focus all physical nerves to your dream you can control the setting your intresets and even taste or hear your dream will asleep you can feel around your dream or taste food in your dream without moving your body this resulting to movement and control of your dream so if you think about it you could turn your dream into a server and connect with other people while they are asleep this resulting the MMO sleepserver or SAO when you dream all of the movement impulses are in you brain they don’t travel down the brain stem or such and you would not be able to intercept them so trying to pick up the electrical signals created while dreaming is  impossible so out of the question and once again would be unreliable even if some how it could happen Actually if u use this dream thing u just need to use cerebral cortex  and use the messages that are sent by electromagnetic waves the brain sends, and if this works it will have abit of problems. One of them is that it would interfere with the feelings of the mind and u might change greatly by messing with their self concise  and their personality so I’d rather more steer away from that it may mess up badly. We just need the technology they had in Inception. why dont you some what combine them and keep the human body “awake” enough  for the breathing to be at a minimal while also dulling the human impulses as breathing takes no thought and breathes automatically unless told by the brain to stop and how you cant choke yourself to death your body and brain wont let you but here its your heart that does the work so if you just keep the brain dulling out of it it may work but if you do people wont walk around while playing the game so lets get to it guys!! in essence a full body coma without harming the brain in any way shape or form, thats the conclusion i’ve come to. to the part of brain waves and patterns it would be easy enough to create a head gear similar to nerve gear with a scanner that hovers above your spine reading all the nerve patterns and signals and sending them into the game, I do agree with you that dulling the signals down say with an inhibitor for the muscles only would indeed work. “when you dream all of the movement impulses are in you brain they don’t travel down the brain stem or such and you would not be able to intercept them so trying to pick up the electrical signals created while dreaming is impossible so out of the question and once again would be unreliable even if some how it could happen” this is a comment i made regarding trying to  use a dream its the same concept as this coma idea but for example a scanner hovering over your spine you’d be on your back that would be a bit bothersome would it not and quite expensive You don’t need to breath in a virtual world, so that signal doesn’t need to be redirected You won’t need to mess with the brain just the nucleus …Look up what a Nucleus is, please. Dumbass… the only problem is is that you cant really dull impulses or anything else without doing something to interrupt the entire transmission which at this point it would be easier to just redirect completely and if you dull them how then would you move the human analog in the game? Or you can do sleep paralysis. You do it every night so you don’t do things irl that you do in you dream. u seem like u know a lot.lol XD Thats why you use nucleus cells from yourself in your skin its not harmful unless you consider 1 skin cell gone harmful. Not trying to be rude just trying to inform ^-^ ok i not sure if you read textbooks but a nucleus is the heart of a plant cell all cells look it up da Soooo sounds like you’ve got this down Lol, i mean, the occulus rift (however you spell thatXD) has a good idea, but like with the galaxy s4′s eye tracking, so you don’t have to scroll, if that was in by the screen for some screen turning action, then we’ve got ourselves another step! the only thing is its not a true step towards VR as we think of it. it makes more people think of VR to be just that not something like sao. but it dose start to get Vr across the field of gaming which is helpful but again not same idea as sao I think that has already been done with something, though I don’t remember what… When we sleep/dream, our brains disconnect from the motor systems in the body.  If one could emulate that process, you could have people dream in a shared simulation.  A little like inception. that’s very true but keeping that severed connection stable and un harmful would be the only problem because while we sleep we are mind is still connected to the motor functions but doesn’t send many impulses it would be hard to keep a constant level of disconnection without harming either one and it becomes very easy to awake so to speak. Frankly, I’m amazed that people have got some legitimate theories…also, while the actual hardware would take immense funding and the device would have to be tested a hell of a lot. The coding aspect is also important – how would you connect a brain ( conscience included) to a server. There would be problems if a powercut cut the server- or someone hacked it. People ( possibly, I’m snatching a straws) could have their brains put into a coma…? I think that if they went with the signal being sent to and from the server/brain via whatever transmitting device, then a sudden cut in power would result in it simply shutting down and the person waking up. Perhaps said transmission device could include a safety feature that automatically gets the person out if it loses the connection? And its circuitry could be designed to break if it is made to go beyond a certain limit, to protect from comas (that’s how fuses work.) …Truth be told, I’m coming up with this from scratch, though. XD also a battery that can keep it on during emergency log-out That actually sounds like a good idea. Dude, I’ve been thinking about the same theory for about a week. I generally think it could work, and I’m curious, would you maybe wanna talk about it? I would LOVE to see the Nervegear and the world of SAO in real life. With the death? Well, there’s a lot of smart people on Earth. I’m sure somebody knows xD actually no because during rim sleep your body secretes a hormone that paralysis the body and he could just use the helmet to manipulate the brain to secrete this while only intercepting the pain and movement signals from the brain but yes you would to have a very in depth knowledge of neurology and bio-engineering and be able to program with the best The day that someone figures out how to transfer ones consciousness to a game will be the day that the world ends (transferring terrorist’s consciousness to robot with explosives on board) Someone has actually successfully made a working “Cortana” like from Halo.  It only lasted for a few minutes, though, until it killed him…  looks like we still have a lot to learn actually it’s no difference between skyrim and here, just the modding would be optional. They sayed it’s like microwave signal’s. Correct right? It’s easier to cooperate with company’s that you have ally’s in. Funding would be a lot easier.Who wouldn’t want to have something to claim rewards to? especially something of this magnitude. But not everyone needs the mirror part of the game It would be just like sleeping if you think about it. All you’d need is a way for the headset to put the body to sleep while keeping the mind awake. Not as hard as it sounds considering we do that on a daily basis as part of a natural process. If one were to work very hard, SAO is completely possible. Oh and the whole “finding a way to keep breathing” thing. Why would you need something to keep your body breathing? The only way your body will stop breathing completely is if something is crammed down your throat, or you have a disorder/disease preventing you from breathing. No developer in there right mind would make something that would interrupt the breathing cycle. If you try to stop breathing, you pass out, and start breathing automatically. If that was invented the price are 1m or 2m or higher It would be badass though and if done people would worship him as god. Honestly it might be easier than we’d expect, go look up REM sleep and the waves that the brain sends out to put you in a full paralysis every night! We’ve also already managed to not only connect a camrea to the visual cortex so that the person can regain sight (even a blind man got to see for the first time), we’ve also already controlled robot arms with just our thoughts so it should definitely be possible to control a virtual avatar using the same method. my friend the world will be in your debt if  it works! hey i would be happy to fund you also but im creating a software just like this im am so close i just cant figure out a few algorithms but the full dive process is so close to being produced we just need about 1 million more US dollars to complete the project i have a huge donor already lined up for it and am hoping the process will be completed i already have a patent on my work but i would be happy to have someone else who can help with it. if you want email me back on this email and ill have one of my assistants talk to you about this. I could help alot I hope you are serious. cmattingly28(at)gmail.com Which patent? I’d like to look into it. so you expect us to give you 500000000$ and say yes to it? let me just sum that up for u hell no! Hey man I wanna be a beta tester…lol. seriously though man I want to be like kirito a beta cheater do you mean a beater Same here man who doesn’t Focus on connecting the advanced nucleus cells located in of your brain to a new type of piece of a cell. The trick is to develop something that the advanced nucleus absorbs so it can pass to the five senses and tricks them into seeing the projections into the new type of piece of a cell. that’s all my studies have gotten me to so far see if you can get any further ^-^. If you find out anything more please tell me I am friends with a game developer who works for Microsoft. Email me at cmattingly28(at)gmail.com Guys here is how to control your character and you can use an occulos rift for sight  now you just need something that can trick your mind into thinking that it’s feeling something or tasting or even smelling and you might be able to do that by sending impulses to your brain just an idea and I know it’s not complete VR but it’s pretty stinking close ^_^ I would too as long as I get to be a beta tester (; It’d be kinda boring to be an Admin, you can have anything in the game just by using the main menu. I’d be glad to fund it. Anything to make my dreams into reality… It’s possible to use sensors to pick up the electrical signals transmitted from the spine. Take as an example: The sensors placed on an actual moving person so you can register what signals move what muscles. Then you’ve more or less turned the helmet into a controller. Added bonus, also look into the senses of the body. Smell, touch ect. Did you know devices that can produce hundreds of different scents exist? You can give a player the sensation of being in a field of flowers or even on the battle field with special pads with controlled air pouches. When the person is shot in the midst of battle motors push and pull air out of the pads giving the feeling of being shot (without the pain obviously). In a previous comment I made, I mention REM state (Rapid Eye Movement) it’s a state of deep sleep in which the voluntary muscles are paralyzed so that the person dreaming doesn’t act out their dreams physically. It’s natures way of keeping you from falling out of the tree at night if you will. Avoiding the big words, there are two things that have to be activated to cause the voluntary muscle paralysis. =^-^= https://www.kickstarter.com/ Hell I’d Donate IF I Saw You Can Actually DO IT You Createeeeeeeeeeeeee but IF YOU CREATE PLS MAKE IT LOGOUT NOT JUST LIKE THE ANIME CANT LOGOUT good luck my friend…..you’ll need it I know a whole lot about how the brain works and how something like that could work in general, maybe we can toss ideas between eachother? I will donate my body for testing, it may go horribly wrong and kill me but I may also be the first person to test real truly immersive virtual reality… I will take that risk!! Instead of dying in the game, why not delete the character? Once you died in the game, you need to do it all over again with a new character. What if you just lose about 10% of your money and respawn in your home. If you die before you have enoughe to buy a house back to begining spawn. drop items that aren’t marked as your favorites and when you die spawn in closest city or village we should have some type of spawn stone or cyrstel respawn there. do wea get telport cyrstel like in the sao Why not just be “logged off” for a certain amount of time so you don’t lose anything but time playing? lol me and you both You better… ._. Anyone else cringe at when people like this one say “I will donate, but you better give me the game for free”? That is not donating, that is just lending. Wth the fact that at least most of you say that probably will donate nothing near enough to cover a full-game’s cost for it, so in the end you are just a big fat and ugly burden to creator(s). All you are doing is being selfish and arrogantly assuming you should get a free game because you tossed chump change in comparison to the amount of money needed to make this. The only thing you should get for being a single individual for donating money is some nice rare-ish item that is flashy and will be ultimately useless other than a money-spent trophy before even mid-game and/or some kinda thank you in the credits that no-one really reads nor will be that impressed. Donations aren’t for you to barely speed up the process and then get granted the ultimate reward of a full game. It should be for you to speed up the process so that you can hurry up and BUY the game. Donations are for the process, buying it is to thank the creators for the excellent game.  Which is why you should only be awarded with something that will eventually be usless, because with donating you are already helping yourself, to get closer to incredible game. When you donate to charity, for example let’s sayyyyy cancer, you don’t have them keep a vial of the cure in case you develop it, you freaking helped mankind, that should be enough, right? Now I should aslo tell you to never post  your own PRIVATE (so busniess emails obviously should not keep one of their means of communication private) email up on the internet to where anyone who was not meant to see it can see it. Forums, comment sections, anything of the such. Emails are probably your least-dangerous of your unique information you can give away, but is still bad to be seen by the wrong people. I could go ahead and snab your email adress and sell it to sleazy businesses for a quick buck, allowing them to target you and do whatever they aim to. But I won’t because that is stupid, and anyone who sells people’s private information are also stupid. I think I said everything I needed to. I believe that some of what you say is correct, unless they donate an absurd amount of money. those that donate either earlier or a noteable amount should be able to be a part of the beta test (dirty beaters lol) everyone should till have fair chance at being a beta tester and i was wondering if it will be a worldwide game or just in certein countries and in the game will we all be talking in the same language. i would also like to be a beta tester for the sao game i was thinking of being a game tester (im still in high school) as a career it better be a world wide game I would think other servers for other countries I agree as well. If someone donates a certain high amount, or if they actually make a contribution other than money that will support the production of either the game or the technology of the console (for example, beneficial research, a produced model, coding, help with game development) if they provide a contribution as valuable as one of these then they are allowed to beta test free Pros = 10years + in game development. Is that so? Researching it now. game and technology are completely different things you need to think about what the priorities are for these people who are creating it tech first then game or have two completely different teams. and you cant make a game based off or nonexistent tech. tech must be created first thank you! good luck creating it. i have been wondering if they’re ever gonna make the game for us fans, i got hooked into it. SUCH A GREAT SERIES (so far)! I’ll play it even if it cost me my life clever. Actually….this is a real game. Its on the PSP but its only japanese only. u missed spelled it SAO and if u cn make it that would b fcking sweet i would def buy If the sword art virual game ever comes out I’m never leaving it this world sucks an I’ve fallen in love with the anime so it’ll be a dream come true. FINALLY SOMEONE WHO AGREES WITH ME xD Its really hard to find a game like you can meet other peeps in SAO world *Q* its like living in the anime world but… PFFFT THERE ISN’T ANY GAME LIKE THAT MOST OF THEM ARE ONLY RPG @_@ trust me i have searched alot and still no use i can’t find that kind of game i’m talking about lol yes thanks bro but also i have the software necessary to make such a game like this ive been working on it for about 2 months now and am so close to the reporduction of the programs if you would like to talk about this i would happy to help ill have an assistant of mine talk to you. I hope your worth it. if you die in the game it should erase ur game….so its at least somewhat realistic Nah, a death penalty should be enforced. Like you lose your items you’re carrying, have to wait a certain amount of time, and have some sort of skills deduction. If it were that you had to make a new character there should be some sort of revival object that is medium in rarity so that when u die its not a suicide mission for your friend, but u owe them BIG TIME! and begin at the town of beginnings with only a sword/dagger/rapier/whatever Heck no! nobody wants that! what if some poor idiot gets locked into a dungeon that is too dangerous for them to handle?!! Then the game developers start getting complaints and bad ratings if that dream of yours will come true can i myself get it free? and is that a promise? Make it more than 10000 copies (Yep!) Release WorldWide I Would marry you if you made this I LOVE SOA if u made SAO come tru well without the death it would be amzing Did SAO already got in Malaysia?? I want to play it so badly!! SAO is already being released?:0 really?!? haha u mean SAO XD hope something similar comes out soon except jus dont want a helmet that traps us online till we clear 100 floors! YAY cant wait send me a beta tester request or request for donation whenever the creation of the game is actually a reality also you might want to team up with a bunch of mad scientist who know their way around bio engineering and neural science…then again you know if this works out the military is gonna want to get their hands on this for training or in your favor they will fund you for this development. the military would probably want this not only for training but to have remote controlled robots doing all the work while all the real people are at some super secret underground base somewhere so that they can not be killed irl while they are in the game, or in the robots body in this case. WOW I can’t believe I actually believe in this… you know it man YAY! if u can make the software and the system where u wear a helmet and it turns into a simulator dude…. SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!! If you make the game I will make the virtual reality helmet. how will u make this? Will it be with a console like nerve gear? loving your answer and would love to test it. may be in the future this virtual world will really come to true. thanks for trying to make it come true I will be by your side when you try to make it happen ill do anything to make that happen!!!! It’s not dumb even if you die in the game you die IRL I would still play it just cause it would be so much fun… im pretty good when it comes to making video games… I am currently working on increasing my skills in that field but i would be more than happy to join you in this quest. Its Sao bro lol Thanks so much I cant wait to play it hurry up and make the game peeps I am DIEING here I love you If you do this and make that a reality, I will call for help from my fellow game designers and we will come to your aid.  I want this game to be made…… but all of the head board members I have talked to say that no one would play this  . I tell you they are wrong!   We shall play this game and love it!!!!!!!!! hell i don’t care if you if is just like the anime or not, just as long as it real what?!! are u serious? wooo!!! that will be so!! coool!!! sugoii!!!! i cant wait that to truly excist!! i will help u to make it happen No please let us die in your world and never log out xD Your our savior!!! wow you fd up SAO hurry up and make it please pick me as a beta player if you  make it. SAO rulesss and and may the vitual reality games be real by fews years from now!!! thanks a lot but if i dont ee thi in the future i will be really sad anyways dont be like sugou either kay dont mess with our brains It was because it was a VRMMORPG, meaning that you had to have the headgear for it. And since it was connected to your brain, it could easily shut your brain off. Are you serious? you’ll be an idol. Can we message eachother? he’s just to excited,thats all - :’) well I got ricked rolled when i wanted to play…….. please theres no more other mmo that i want to play than this one please release it I’d love you if you accomplished this (before 20017) :3 That’s a looong time… Hehe ^•^ i totally agree and we want are brains to move are cheater  or something with out a controller and not to pricey and bulid in headset and mic SAO!!! SAO!!! SAO!!! SAO!!! I’m making a game just like Sao I have been developing it for a year now and it will b in production by 2015 I was working on research for a good design and program but I hit a snag when I came across REM state in the human body. So far, all I’ve come across is activating it medically and last I checked no one wants to take pills to play a game. Basically what I’m saying is that using REM state a person can play the game without having to physically move. Laugh if you want but its a start. I really hope so Someone please make this game. Whoever makes it should make it a great quality game since the anime is top notch. SOMEONE MAKE IT. IM THE BIGGEST SAO FAN. when?? hay if you ever mack this man i will not only love you for making it but i will send some cash to help maby Bull shitter your not making a game one you couldn’t make a head set thats lets you be in the game and you would need to know about neuroscience to be able to connect it to the 5 sences and are technology isnt good enough yet go kill your self please. I WILL STAND IN A LINE FOR A MONTH TO GET YOUR GAME IF I HAVE TO!!! Dude it would be great if u could do this do u plan on making the nervegear to? and if u were how long do u think it will take I wish people with do that with the anime .hack// Theres also a SAO indie game in production i want to play this game. if there’s a chance.. You are my hero. :,( please god do this!! I believe in you. i can’t play the game !! but i want to play the game.. Thanks kirito halo ive been waiting on the real sao to come out i hope you have it done soon i cant wit to play I WANT THIS TO BE REAL BRO!!! Also, can your company be called ARGUS? Get it? ^_^ dude, hear me out. make it as close to the anime and manga as possible. make it as difficult! I expect everything mentioned in the anime to end up greatly explorable. skill trees should be large and varied, and make all the rare skills just as rare, (dual wielding should be one of the rarest). and on to my main point, make it just like the anime and manga, if you die your avatar dies and you start over. death is permanent in SAO, that can’t change. And my company will make the Nerve Gear! hope better be true BE MY HERO! I look forward to it, GOOD LUCK! have you formed your company yet? And if you have i would like to be a part of the programming group that could take something like the oculous rift and mod it with sensory pads that allow the nural pathways to such an extent that the outer body looks paralyzed. please contact me back on this site and maybe we can team up and work together to complete your intregeing project. If you dont make it before MY company is formed, i will make this game can you tell me  how to play this game uh hell no hurry up and do it Yeeeeaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 No, it’s a troll and terrible. It’s SAO ! I hope this game will exist for real .. NerveGear also !! Yehhhhs… Pls do so. Im a big fan of sao! Dude, I am soooo counting on you and if you can, i want to be a beta tester ^-^ I support you all the way bro. SAO!!!!!! Also Kayaba had a reason for making the game’s death realistic you idiot. And I doubt you would be able to recreate SAO with just your intellect. Virtual Reality hasn’t even been perfected as well as SAO has. Come back down to reality before you give someone a headache. PLEASE make this i believe you can do it and so many are depending on you and your company when its formed can you please work on this first YOU WOULD BE A HERO oh yeah and if u do i would be pleased to beta test it I hope so Yes i Would Love a Virtual MMORPG Like Soa But.. The Tech is Just Too High For Now.. he Tech They Used inThe Show Was Around 2020-2024… Thats a Long Way From Now…. Just make it so you can’t take the helmet off and if you die in the game you go back to real life. after that i will make alfiem with all the features in the anime I’m with u man i gonna help ya there is probably all ready is a company trying making a server system like nerve gear so yeah your to late to start an original company and you would be sued plus like Wolf_Fang97 said it’s Sao SAO * First it’s SAO second if you can that would be great third thanks I can help! I and my team code alot! WE just need someone who knows how to work the brain… Well hurry up! We need this game!!! dude I really hope you make this I want that nerve gear! I actually intend to help them make the nerve gear actually, the people who are making it right now though are hard to reach, but I’ll find a way to contact them I think it would be better If u can jus make ur own character and do ur own quest and beat the game with ur over powered person instead of being Kirito. I hope so man… I hope soo…. If it helps i thought of a way nerve gear may have/ may will work, because i have the same idea as you Yay for SAO if you make this game i will love you lololo You my sir, are my hero. its been a year…still waiting Its SAO, idiot. umm SAO is sword art online but SOA is sons of archery is this out yet??? yes sword art online game where ya. find where yes Freaking finally please do it soon im not saying its not possible (cause i hope VR gaming is created before i die even tho im 13) but you have to think of how your brain reacts to death in the game cause if your brain actually thinks it died then it’s gonna die but really i do hope you or some other engineer/scientist/really smart person does create VR gaming like sao !!! Dude, i have the same dream and i will no matter what be your partner in making this happen no matter what. I wish they could make the game SAO but with out the story behind it I want it to be like the adventure they had like I wanna live there idc i will die for that game *-* THANKS MAN YOU ARE A NICE GUY I WANT THAT JUST AS MUCH AS YOU HAY I WILL EVEN HELP YOU WITH YOUR BUSINESS I HAVE BEEN REHASHING ON VIRTUAL REALITY GAMING AND IT IS MY NEW FOUND DREM THANKS its SaO not SOA, and if you can actually make this, good luck and i will be playing Why not let the fans take the risk of dying in real life cause honestly I think that would be the best part of the game and to feel the rush of fighting for your life would be amazing. hey id still be happy dying in aincrad, its an amazing game, as long as my death is justified and i die fighting the most badass monster in the game i couldnt give two shits XD Hows making the game coming along u are amazing <3 if you manage to do that i would love you  4 life xD cause my dream is to play something like SAO in virtual reality i don’t think this is a game Well turn the hurt down pls ~crys~ THANK YOU!! I F*&KING LOVE YOU MAN!!!! Can You Really Make A Virtual World? make this game please and when you make it, be sure to create more than 10,000 copies, because i most likely wont be able to be first in line… sounds awsome YES PRAISE THE VIRTUAL WORLD pls make this a realiaty HERE HERE what soa u not a fan every fan knows its sao If you die in the game you cant log in until someone else in the game helps you! THIS MUST EXZIST lol but seriously make it happen Hey its me as a spartan lol If you can do that then you are better than Kayaba so please do this PLZ make this game im going crazy here YAY! when u create ur company, hire me! im good with creating games then it will be who can do it first…. trust me mate I’ve looked into it first you’d have to tap into the motor neurones in the spine and redirect them without causing damage. then you would have to find a way to tap into other nerves directly in the skull …… only problem is with todays technology the only way to acquire those links is through surgical implants. and as no one knows how much data it takes to host a human brain its anyway in-between 1 to 100 terabytes so its not easy trust me im looking into it you get rick roled :’(  I tried to play to sign up , but I kept getting Rich rolled ! this is not funny I really wanna play. To have a game just like that I would LOVE it. ive always wanted to play in a vitural world like that ! SOA!!!!!!!! GET IT RIGHT yes it will T^T i dont see what the big deal is that you die in the game you die irl, you die real life you die so its your choice to fight mosters, live in the game it is practicaly an enhanced life i would play it Can I play 2????? great comment Can i be one of the thousand beta testers we shall hensforth call you master, and fight 100 floors for your joyment More interesting if you could die :/ im actually entering mechatronics like kirito, i really want create a virtual reality. so please if you ever plan to go through with this then please count me in this You could die in that game.That game(SAO) uses full dive.It connects to your brain nerve system.That’s why they don’t move when they play.If you play using Oculus, you will move.And by the way, it’s not idiot gamers who create cool gadgets and stuff.Guys who learn science do that stuff.And 1 more thing, there is no logic in most anime. i’ll jion the party. the names bladehound0 but my freinds call me bladehound. but that would be SOOOO COOL, die in real life if you die in game, PEOPLE WOULD TRY SOOOOO MUCH HARDER make that come true you do know the game dose exist it’s for psp and psp vita Well the right to make Sao will go to the first company to make a real vr device not a crappy oculus rift clone I I will make sure that company is mine the ultra powerful company soa means std in my country hahaha its sao “Arigato, Sayonara” -I’m sure you know who. Their soul and life force is linked to their in game character. HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE YOO CAN DOO EET! Make it a death game it would be awesome can you just do it already??? I WANNA LIVE IN THE VIRTUAL WORLD IM SO DONE WITH THIS WORLD You should know that if you make this game, you’ll have a lawsuit the size of Massachusetts. kids will grow up with the tech all adults will die before this comes out so ha THANK YOU!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOUUUUUUUU!!!!!!! :,,D At least make the game permadeath to make it similar to SAO and challenging. i dont want just another MMORPG dammit, if i die in the game, make my character stay dead! you can make new characters, but make the game so if a character dies, it can’t come back. please do make it cuz im so tired of posers letting us down and just laughing at our failed attempts to find a game somewhat close to the anime OMG YES!!!!!!! I got rick rolled. too bad there was an advertisement lmao i Love SAO <3 Overused joke alert. Walk away. DID WE JUST GET RICK TROLLED? YEA I SAID RICK TROLLED. HOW DO WE FALL FOR THIS STUFF WTF MAN! BLAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Instead of dying in real life, why not just delete the character once you died in the game? You can only have one character per world or one character per IP address. That way it will be more much fun and thrilling like in SAO. Um…….. Why have a website and play now button if its not there? Freaking stupid idiotic game poster! XD I’LL MAKE SURE TO TELL EVERYONE HERE (Creators of POKEMON GENERATIONS) to make this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11 …. then suddenly Rick Astley came out wer can i play? i would help anyway i can to make this a true life game. this better not me a prank i swear to god kirito you soo so cool ^-^ and you asuna ^-^ sign me up as a beta tester I hope it comes out quick @#$%! the person who messed with me cause I want to play a sword art game! i was so happy and exited ………. but then i got rick rolled ……….T^T why?? awesome game Does anyone know how to freaking download this,i tried but it wont let me! did i just get rick rolled? ……… AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH! when is the sword art online mmo game coming out? anyone else get rick rolled can someone tell me when they game will actually be created….. me and my boyfriend are real fans and we really want to experience the game…. Without dieing in real of course…. because that is just scary… why cant i play the game I hope they make a game like this one day its gone be EPIC …Akward… This is BS i was really wanting to play this NOT LISTEN TO FUCKING RICK!!! wtf is this shit, i clicked on play now and it fucking took me to Rick astley Rick Astley didn’t explain well enough. How do I install this? this is coming out for xbox 720 and ps5…..in other words, in the generation after ps4 and xbox one i wish there are online game like dis but only on the computer… to be able to create a device such as the nerve gear you would have to have knowledge on neural science, bio engineering, and a mass amount of funds to start the creation of a thing that could stop all signals from the brain to the rest off the body without harming the person then being able to successfully transmit those same signals to a virtual body on a massive server created and hosted on a advanced computer. And how exactly almost all the body would be shut down and the mind still fully active and nothing harmed in this entire process. Someone please make this game & some type of full dive gear! There are websites what you can go on to ask for funding! i would totally support anyone who was trying to make it! If we can make robot arms for humans that link to your brain to move them Im sure we could do this!!!! DUDE Kirito Halo i hope u r serious man it would be a dream come true not just for gamers but for anime fans alike if u did somehow or form create somethin like this and i personally will help fund this mission no matter what. how DO I play SWORD ART ONLINE his what u said it is not out ololololol there is another place where they are creating sao game http://www.moddb.com/games/sword-art-online There is no game. i try to play it, i get taken to Youtube listening to Never Gonna Give You Up. I want to play this game I almost cried when I was Rick Rolled because I was really hoping to be able to play SAO. Where i can get that helm ? make it look like the real world though Neuroscience is a very difficult subject. To have an object to disable your body functions… You would probably become paralyzed or just even die. You would need test subjects. You could kill someone. If you want to take the risk and the punishment… Just don’t even try. Our technology is far too mediocre. There are items such as the Oculus Rift that you could use. But it doesn’t use your body functions. It’s just a really good image. So, please. Get a degree for neuroscience and engineering before you even attempt. And don’t do anything that would harm another. Not necessarily u just have to somehow get your brain to go into REM sleep or something like that you must make an sao game in english I AM DYING TO PLAY IT I know that 1 day the never gear will be created..do you all believe it? Hey guys..i hope i can find you all in the virtual game.. ^ ^ i cant wait.. why the heck are most of the links going to some youtube video? Please make this game for pc cause I want to play it right now!! or after! We need to play the Game!! Sword Art Online! Come On!!!!!!! In our days i think its possible to create something as this game, because we already have google glasses and a lot of great computers and systems that can make this possible. If only a company who created google glasses would combine the amazing graphis and these days technology i think its possible. But of course it would cost a lot of money to make this kind of game. OMG.  enough said.  Please.  Give me.     Developers start up a kickstarter campaign.  I guarantee you will get easily $700k + to start this game. I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO PLAY THIS GAME.But I don’t want to play it with a death penalty.THIS THING CAN GET ADDICTIVE YOU KNOW!And have you guys heard the Nerve Gear system is 70% done.But i know they are hiding something. some thing they don’t want us to know. I think this has to do with Area 51. I JUST KNOW IT! If you put the pieces together you will understand.We don’t have High Tech equipment,it’s been 1 year since the show came out, and why would they make a game like this all I know i a toddler might somehow login to the game and end up in there! AFTER I FINISH STUDYING I WILL MAKE THIS GAME SO I GUESS THERE’S A RACE IF WHO WILL MAKE THE GAME FIRST AS SOON AS I FINISH STUDYING I WILL MAKE A GAME LIKE THIS OR THIS GAME SINCE EVERYONE WANTS TO MAKE A GAME LIKE THIS THEN I THINK IT’S A BET ON WHO WILL MAKE THE GAME FIRST And I thought it was real… I need anger manegment classes. ddd please someone i WANNA PLAY THIS GAME Lol create SAO? create a new OS first for 40+ years then create a mapping system which requires a huge amount of data. how can you create a full dive system? (Oculus rift isnt even Close? sense of touch, smell and everything is needed. Everything you see around your room should be identical in the VR world. and the system uses the “nerve in the “brain”' which should be really problematic since it could be fatal. (Truthfully I think all people in this generation will die without experiencing the world of virtual reality)  at least someone makes it before i am 18. i will definitely play esp. bcoz i can be forever with the person i truly love .. i hope this is real you get rick rolled if you play .-. wangwang um bro’s how do i play this if i click play game it will turn to youtube I just hope they make a game like SAO before I get to old… I’m already 15 years old, and now is the time to play games, before I begin to work, or something like that. wtf every time i click on the link  to a fucking rick astly song i hate rick astly how do we play it? dont tell me u rick rolled me how can i play this isu anjing WHEN  IS THIS GAME RELESHED I WILL BE FROM THE FIRST WHO WILL BUY IT Uh, when I clicked “PLAY NOW!” There’s this awkward youtube video that comes up….

WHEN WILL WE BE ABLE TO PLAY THE FREAKING GAME???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????///// never gonna give you up I would play this whether in 100 years old or if I get stuck in it or not! i bet you that it would be great to have it stuck on for a while, that way no ones contently bugging you to do otherwise. Yah, i dont want to die but whether it in the game or in RL, you can die. therefore, someone hurry up and make this! Ill support you! Hell, ill be the first to sign up as a beta tester :u dont worry sooner or later we wont need  a computer to play this we will be using google glass for everything XD Thanks =) i want to be in SAO ao bad its so cool i agree with you plus idont really see this Virtual reality thing working no time soon but ill be waiting . make game based off ALO plus this type of game needs that virtual reality gear to really be like SAO that would be nice using that gear for other good games to even some of our current day online mmo games Don’t click on the SAO official site it will rickroll you that’s mean making a link to the gayest song ever. You hurt us sao fans with the promise of being able to play our favorite anime. I forever hate the creators of this site rick rolled hard wtf it sent me 2 youtube april fools my damn ass this is a cruel joke.

Hey guys.. Is there a real game for this Anime ? ^^ LOVE THIS SHOW!!!! The second to last episode was werid he was licking her fucking rick astley I AM ASUNA kidding i do like asuna though. I just want to play the game not listening the music Been RickRolled… –’ does this game work yet ganda talaga ng sowrd art I LOVE SWORD ART ONLINE!!!! I LOVE KITTYTOE!!!!!!!! good luck and more power to you.the only draw backs are six things (sorry have family in medical aeras) the first problem is due to the fact that proteteic that no feeling. once you are able to bridge that you will have the power and money to hold all dreams. though medical tech is about 15 years away from it due to the funding but A.I has been limited to the stand alone complex. there are actual things similar to this that they use on war vets and stuff so theoreticly if those went into mass production and you got sao to go along with it you could make this happen within the next few years. yea hope it comes true befor i get grown NEED TO PLAY SWORD ART ONLINE IN THE VIRTAL WORLD why dont they make real nerv gear but wear it doesnt kill if you die Nerves Gear and Sword art online are very close !!! Even if you die in real life I don’t care Ill play it !! xD No SAO in Malaysia?? I want to play it!! Did SAO already in Malaysia?? I want to play it so badly!! SAO SAO SAO SAO SAO !!!!! damn kayaba He was ryte 2 SCUICIDE in the ANIME IF IT BECOMES THAT THERE IS NO LOGOUT OPTION THEN FEAR NOT DEAR ASUNA I WILL BEAT THAT GAME EVEN IF IT TAKES MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yay! This is gonna be so FUN! Go Kirito! I love it! I love warrior games and its weird cuz i am a girl $) I would donate money for this, as long as I get to beta test it. Dose anyone know when they will release the beta for this? ive played SAO it was aosome it was the beta ive played you should be able to die it makes it most interesting How to Play This Game why does it bring me to a youtube song when i click play now? very good idea for an rpg game i hope this kicks off as one of the future MMORPG konbanwa you got me good with that rick roll XD want to play SAO its not true Have the MMO come out? Because when I click om play game I came on Youtube… dude best idea ever I wish there was a game like sao and log horizon Lmao!! Everyone’s name is either Kirito or Asuna.. hehe mines Karen nice to meet ya how do i play the gaame? I want to play but I can t how can I go to the game take down the stupid link that takes you to a you tube video i got rick-rolled… actually ideas are good but without the funds still it cannot be tested. there’s another problem guys if you’re working on a prototype there’s gotta be a volunteer!!! why ican’t download it? kontol memek gimana ngunduhnya bego dasar cacad gk ada otak lu tai babi monyet cacat permainan gk ada mutunya anjing babi muka lu udah kayak bool sapi,tai lu dasar daki onta,gk bisa di unduh tod ngentod anjing lu babi lalalalalalalalalaa ublublublublublbulbulbulbulbulbublulbublub (___)(___)========================D—— <<<<<<<<<<< Gambar apa ini ? I click sword art online and  were does it lead me ,Rick Astley never gonna give you up ! Were is the true game:( I absolutely love the idea that you can actually have a real life! I mean I would so devastated when Kirito beat the game i love this show so much when i miss a show it drives me insane!!! hehehe then hurry up makin it xD I just did both and Fake.. I cannot play the game when I clik on ”play” I go to youtube. WHY???????????? Its a joke from April Fools day CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHERE TO FIND THIS GAME,THE STUPID LINK IS BROKEN me and a couple of my friend are trying to making it Wait is not actually a game because it redirects me to a song on Youtube? FU I just got rickrolled D: how can i play this game?? Not being able to logout and the possibility of actually dying are what made SAO real. It was thanks to these factors that the game was what it was and in all honesty I would still play it. ikr this is the shits I thought bleach was the shit for the longest but sao came out and im soooo addicted to it haven’t missed 1 ep yet -_- MAKE IT TO SO IF YOU DIE YOU DIE IT MAKES IT MORE EXCITING if you click the sword art online official site link you’ll know that this is all just a joke I’m wondering why they don’t just set up SAO on a computer already where people use the keyboard and mouse then later on put in the nerve gear when they’re finished main it. Main it was supposed to be making it Looks good but why try make it like the anime series not everyone wants to be Kirito, so i assume might be some. But personally i would prefer to make my own character in the world of Sword Art Online RICK ROLLED I hope I can play SAO in my last days, when I will become old Help? when I click the official site or play now it doesn’t work.. it keeps on playing some weird videos from youtube.. I don’t like this sight. They brought my hopes up and smashed them back down! First off, one word Copyright or Trademarked, you guys cant make an SAO game without the expressed permission of the owner kiritoosmoe This would be an extremely difficult concept if you were to try and do it the way it is in the anime, but I wouldn’t say its impossible. One reason I loved the anime was because it had some element of realism. Although it would be a lot easier to design it as a basic concel game for PC, Xbox, or PS4. As a concel game, it actually be a simple design, but I would love to see it executed as a VRMMORPG even more. I just got rick-rolled… XD heeheh yes         >_<   heppy goodddddd i cant play every time i click play now some dude starts singing so when will this game be released? i cant wait till they start selling nerve gear Can someone send me the link to play sao pls i can’t figure out how to make a character ;.; y u troll so hard…;.; That is for psp by the way KAYABA! Aura Kingdom is like sword art online its in beta and founders beta OMG I WISH I KNEW HOW TO READ JAPANESE GOD DAMN THE WORLD TT^TT TROLLED! -_____-  PLEASE MAKE THIS GAME!!! just make it with an exit button tho… i can’t play it takes me to this lame video Can you really play this game Cuz It redirect to youtube When I clicked the official site .. how to play this ? Ahem, not a good troll… Wasn’t really funny. wait is this really gonna happen! if it is im gonna buy it!!! i love this anime and being able to play the game would be soooo cool!. Actually this is an april’s fool… but did you guys read the features? Some stuff in there could be possible to realize and would be actually pretty darn cool in my opinion. Some big company should actually try to buy the rights for this, they’d make a shitton of money if done right. (I can already see the thousands of microtransactions just to get kirito’s suit… and that is just one item they can implement in a cash shop =P) ….really…what was the point of this? the button just took me to some crappy youtube video… -.- click on officiaal site for more info on the game ugh seriously any here ever heard of TED? Im pertty sure others already have this idea in progress. It would be a waste here when i try to play takes me to youtube how do i play?? To all the fools saying you’d need to be in a paralysis state is wrong you could be just asleep and have the nerve gear actually interfere with the brain signals thus stopping movement while in game and it should read the signal like lets say you brain send a signal to the nerves in your arm to move the nerve gear will get it signal before those nerves and move the signal to the game so you move in there.Now this could work with adding chips in your spine and it really depends how fast the nerve gear is to catch those brain signals and transfer them in the game so in the next ten years it would be possible. Reply to me if you think other wise Hi everyone i love the show i cant wait for the game to be in the us . I love it I hope the head gear comes true… it would be awesome to actually be in a virtual world can we not. this anime made me cry… a lot… im still not over sachi…. why we cant play the game dam this link I hate it so much when u click play now at the top of the page u just got trolled that stupid song -_- how do u actually play Well go get fucked by rick Why when I click the “Play now” link it takes me to a youtube page with some guy singing a song called “Never gonna give you up?” I honestly thought Kayaba had an amazing idea, although he sorta forced it on people. Games like that should have a hardcore setting that you can activate but never take off that makes it so that if you die you die in real life and you can’t log off unless you’re at full health. XD porem devia ter a opção de linguague para poder ter portugues porem nao ser permitido hackers pq se nao perde a graça pra quando sera  o lançamento ?? English please se o jogo sair desse jeito q apresenta vai fazer muito sucesso e muitos otakus irar joga-lo e os ser totalmente com os movimento do jeito que nois quizermos sairia melhor this also better come in english If  you do that bro you will be the coolest person alive that’s my dream pleas make it come true I am reading all of these awesome comments about the technology needed and  only just noticed after reading for like 3 mins that Rick Astley is still playing in the background -_- so the game isnt out yet? MAKE THIS GAME PEOPLE!!!! how to download this games? I WANNA PLAY IT MAKE THE GOD D@M3 GAME ALLREADY LIES, THIS FORUM WAS ALL LIES, IT IS STILL LIEING, WHY MUST YOU LIE TO US YOU A**HOLES, DAMN YOU TO HELL AND ALL THE OTHER NASTY PLACES GOD DOESN’T LIKE i fucking hate this website i go exited thinking i could play a sword art game and that never gonna give u up comes on aye sir why am i being redirected to a youtube video? when will it be made god dam it it would be an honor to beta test it aye sir it takes me to youtude when i try to play When it originally posted, it was an April Fools Day thing. But the game does exist…as a PSP game in JAPAN. There is still no word on it going overseas There is also an official unofficial project at age-of-aincrad.com/forum/ Well, they plan to buy the license and make it official, but first they need to have a demo for the proposal. actually nobody died for real.. Here’s the comment I posted on youtube The 3 2 1 thing was supposed to be spead out a little more godamn it all you whining about if you create sword art irl dont take out the die if you die thing cause thats what gave people drive and made it iteresting if you so set on no death make it so the helmet will put you into a coma till the games beats if you die hello guys how to play sword art online how can you play this game? The NerveGear is a helmet with a smooth, deep blue color. At the back, it has a wire of the same color stretched out of a long pad. It also has a battery and internal memory to store data from the games, which is how Kirito stored Yui in it. 30% of the NerveGear’s weight is from its internal battery. The NerveGear’s high density microwave transceivers can determine what the user’s face looks like. The transceivers not only block every transmission from the brain to the body, but also from the body to the brain; while using it, the player is completely insensate to the physical world. Unknown to anyone except for Kayaba prior to the opening of Sword Art Online, the NerveGear’s transceivers possess enough power to fry the player’s brain with a burst of microwaves, using the power from its internal battery, and SAO’s operating system has been programmed to do so if the player’s hit points are reduced to zero. Logically, It would be possible to create the nerve gear if you had the right materials (and the brain) but there are just a few problems to overcome… Jokes on you I love that song I clicked PLAY NOW I cant believe I feel for tat ok kirito halo if u do make this mmorpg I think it would be cool if a game company or the government made the same tech called nevgear it would be a whole lot better the playing on a computer server so if u do ever do that I will support u all the way man These are just screens of the psp game -.- I think we were rick rolled. i want join this game.. but i don’t know how to download? can u help me? HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME ? when will this game be made i stole my sister computer to play this game!!!!!!!!!!! and i will NOT rest until i play this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hello Can somebody comment back??? Please! I’m dying to talk to those people that are actually starting a project to produce such technology. I’d like to ask questions. I LOVE THIS ANIME SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! can someone teach me how o play this game pls!!!!!! how to download Sao online games ?? i wonder what the oculus rift will be able to work on…i think they said everything but im not enirely sure… Arrrrrrgghhhhh!!!!! my god when is it gonna come out >.> tai sapi kirito Not really anticipating its released even though I’m a SAO fan. Just saw the teaser trailer and kinda lost all the hype I had. not fucking cool you don’t take a game from an awsome anime and change it to you tube when i found this i was so goddamn happy that i could play the game from the anime and it brought me to a youtube link i was pissed not cool at all if this is some kind of  joke im not laughing Can someone please tell me wwhen this game comes out please. I wwant to know if it is still avvaible at gamestop. ok Eridan Also can someone tell me if its still possible to get, wwhere to get it and wwhat game systems it comes on.Thanks guys. i sure as hell hope somone makes this soon and not rename it some cheap copy like blades of assention BOA and when they do make it they better fix that link or set a seperate one i dont know how much longer i can wait -_- WE JUST GOT RICKROLLED hahaha how to play this game age-of-aincrad.com/forum/  . Why does it keep on putting me to some youtube song when i want to play it Please make game better im sorry to say but tales of xillia is so much better in design as well as fighting. I am a hugh fan of SOA. I got rickrolled XD The Game isn’t out yet i just found out that… Those links are trolls… There isn’t a official site even up yet… and SAO the game is still in production SAO the game is being made at age-of-aincrad.com/forum/ no rick rolls there Omg can’t wait then but the thought of being traped in a game like Sao would be amazing you would really be yourself since the thing what’s his face did when he told the players to look at the mirro. In ep.1 just the not dyein part would not do but every thing else would I mean it would be freaking amazing to join a real guild!!! :3 please hav the game developed by 2017 I will be 16 by then!!!! Noooo I MEANT YOU CAN’T DIE!!!!!!!! Damn typo!!! I clicked play an I went to YouTube for some reason……-.- all these great ideas on just a troll website for an anime… if you want an IRL sao then you should go to big company’s that might accept the idea of “mind controlled gaming” Roses are red, my name is dave. This make no sense, mircrowave it can be done w’ve got the tec we just need some one to put 1+1 together but every one is afraid of a .hack/ ghost in a shell  brain hack scenario. 1 thing NPC design for a game of infinite resource files would amount to an estimated (500Kx500K M Map data + bossrooms and traps) 2000 TB of storage for just the map RICK ROLLLERS FTW give me play How do I play I’ve dreamt of living in SAO but if they do make it real like in the show then I share the same fear of never getting to log out…even if it might be cool I’m more scared of actual death then a virtual death… MOTHER FUCKERS. stupid trolls lol how do I play the game tell me how do I play the game because it puts me in youtube Is this real ? it just takes me to youtube! where’s the game?! When VR comes out: NerveGear please make an SAO MMO damnit without dying and a log out button Damn this other people they are not telling us how to play it soo they trying to hide it and the other’s can’t play the game! Yeah i hope they do actually finish making it if they dont then it would be a waste of my time getting excited… Oh and kirito halo, your the sorta guy i like xD always dreaming awesome stuff for the future actually setting a goal and something big i like that. a game where you can die is to easy thank you This is a Rickroll.. If you hit “Play now” It opens up Rick Astley:Never gonna give you up. .-. So..Where is my Massive dislike button? *sigh* if only that was possible…:( HOW TO PLAY THE GAME?! If everyone wants to settle for a simpler design. I know a way to create a working system right off the bat. It’s just that its a more active system and people will be disappointed that you cant just put the helmet on and lay down to play… Its not my original design but it’s a current tech possible design. Anyone out here remember when we were kids and Walmart started selling virtual reality games where you fought ninjas and such. Very similar. You have the helmet, air pads, a system similar to AromaRama, a flat top-rounded bottom treadmill base, and obviously the position sensors (like what the wii and such have). I mean its not high tech fancy but it would bring some of the scare factor back in Resident Evil. i just saw the last episode in season 1 and it was sad thank you Why is it that the website sends you to Rick Astley’s Never Gonna Give You Up? Where is the game, RICK & ROLL ?!?!?! this game does not exist it just sends you to a youtube video don’t click it AND THIS LITTLE PRANK IS NOT FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1! I really wanted to play this game when is this game going to caome out? Dont you dare rick roll us about an anime again…. Then do me a favor and make it compatable with the oculus rift, you hear me Kirito Halo? Hello. I’m new here.Any one can help me ?? T.T *i didn’t know how to start i will try 2 make the system 4 sao later in life I LOVE SAO! IT RULES! Nice movie. A game for psp is good, but a game in a pc is much better. Creating a real life game like this needs time or impossible lol. I think we need many more centuries for it to work in our world lol.. But despite for the limitation to create this game pls consider to try to create. one day past i see how to enter the game and i not understand the languange. can i play this game ? just wait until the smart goggles come out some time this year if you don’t know what they are look it up…..pretty amazing how can i play the game.. its always directing to youtube isnt this just from the ps vita sword art online in which i find .hack games still far more superior. There is a game, but for those who are really cheap you have to wait but you can buy Sword art Online: infinity moment Sword Art Online: Infinity Moment | Buy Sword Art Online: Infinity Moment (Japan Version) for Sony PSP (PSP) here, hope you enjoy I will take this fast, this site is a troll, there are a new SAO but it’s under beta-testing and there is Sword art Online: Infinity moment with is a continued play up to level 100 and not 75 a in the series, so don’t leave new comments so this bluff can be avoided how can i download dis game -.-’ damn ur life IT SWORD ART ONLINE INFINITY MOMENT AND THIS ON PSP AHHH! i got Rick Rolled!! *sigh* so much for that haha WHERE CAN I PLAY IT!!! WHEN CAN I PLAY IT??? HOW CAN I PLAY IT??? I WANT IT SOOOOO BAD!!!!! PLEASE! gimana cara download nya nih ? plz hurry The video is from an aprill fools joke on youtube. The only up coming release for SOA is for the Vita and the only release i’ve found isn’t an MMO either. The official website link takes you to a crap youtube song lol how long until u make it mr. halo. i have waited too long….. I wonder if they’ll let you create your own character to play alongside the main characters, if not I’ll be happy just playing the game. I was rickrolled. HOW DARE YOU DASH MY HOPES! its aeria, therefore its ruined. not worth playing. how to play it can we actually play it right now on computers Are you have patch english for SAO IM psp? aw, so it means this game is for only in PSP and vita ? and it is not allowed in PC ? tsk ! Aeria only publishes games they are NOT a game developer. So yes this is a very bad April Fools joke.

Then peckersmack them when they try to get information on it. I wont be using OnRPG.com ever again lol way to ruin what people are really looking for and what you can not reproduce you half-assed website.

I think it should be playable on the Rift:) Rick. Asley’s. back… NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! I don’t think we can play SAO.Because whenever I click “play now” it’s brings me to see youtube video!>:(    very disappointed! UGHHHH CANT PLAY!!! “You have failed me for the last time,admiral.”     -Darth Vader WHOEVER TRICKED US,SPEAK UP OR ELSE FACE SUDDEN DOOM When will sao become real? i need it more than you ccould ever know. In all honesty i dont think its just a game so even if we would die irl i would still play cause it would only make it that much more real plus i know i wouldnt die I don’t want the SAO game to be another 3rd person view game “based off of the story” I want it to be an accual RPG first person semi-free play game. Where you can design and meet your own characters, not the story’s characters. Where your character can beat the 100 levels your own way, the accual SAO game, not one based off the storyline. Really?YAY! i want to make the game ! The official site is a bunch of crap.the world needs this game Alright well I NEED this game to come out or I will go crazy. can’t you play the game on your laptop or computer? If so, how. YOU GOT RICK ROLLED ! XD  God damn ! ^^ I hope so,or else you will suffer the consequences of not keeping your word. Why must we be “Rick Rolled”?? akahito I went to SAO Official Website and there is no button that says “PLAY NOW” yeah man you should make the game for America and keep the price in the 100 dollars range this is fake rick rolled… thanks Kickass.to has the game and some soundtracts I am so mad i have been trolled here ohhhh I want to kill someone but then i would be a red player is this game? So can we play it or they’re just making plans to do it and it’s not out yet My company is designing the NerveGearm set to release on april 22, 2019. SAO is the first game i’ll make, with the castle Aincrad in the sky. Thank you so much,so when I’m 17 ill be able to play it?if not I will rage so hard I will brake the earth in half. Also,if it takes you more than 5 years to make SAO a reality,I will rage so hard I will break 9.9 BILLION keyboards over my knee i wish the would make more seasons WHY. Why did you have to Rick-Roll me ;^; Luckily I like the song xD Ha, little did you know, I actually like rick astley kayaba had a reason for doing it guyz can you help me how to play the game Funny moment after you click on [PLAY] button and [OFFICIAL SITE] yeah, got rolled… GOD PLEASE MAKE THIS POSSIBLE!!!!

When do they make season 2 of SAO and Elfheim online because I heard it was something like gun something but I also heard he is going to be a girl but im not to sure so tell me when ok guys *clicks play button gets rick rolled* FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU why did it have to be a rick roll lols so rick rolled? really? haha from were i can downloAD it? lol that’ll be the day if i click ‘ play now’ then a video of you tube starts playing……can anybody help ??? gad dammers we need an exact replica of the anime and instead of vr we could just use keyboards and oculas rifts until they really make some vr gear will we play the game this game is so nope laa for some odd reason everytime i try to go to the site it takes me to youtube.. -_- is Nervegear is really in reality? zzz is tis a game??? y i click play now, its bring me go to youtube????? where the real game the reason you’re taken to youtube: YOU’VE ALL BEEN RICKROLLED For now, if you wanna play… check out age of aincrad or Blades of Ascension. Both are still pre-alpha but its kinda cool to see the maps theyre makng on the servers. ^^ This isnt completely fake, same idea just that we havent gotten that far. All sao games are focusing on graphics for now. RICK ROLL MOTHER FUGGER kirgaya kirto It was genius making the play now buttion go to a rick roll just imagine if its exactly equal to sword art online and if you die in the game you die in real life im mad because so many sites say this but its not true >:L This is my first time being rickrolled. It’s so mean to do that to people outside hell. This rickrolling thing is so mean. Rickrolling is so mean. god damn it you lying bastards! You crushed me!!!!! It’s time. WE. MUST. CREATE. THIS. TOGETHER. YOU GOT ME SO EXITED. I… ;——; yea but the question for me is when will nerve gear and SOA is real How do I join the game and play it as well! When I click the official link it redirects to Youtube! I really want to join! what your really need to do is to make it where the nervegear can sustain life so you can be in the games for longer amounts of time but how do u make a acount for sao WE NEED THIS GAME uh god really rick rolled should have seen that one coming |_| its SAO Sword art online not SOA Rick why do you have to ruin everything? -_- I Longly Antisipate The Relese Of This Game… And Kirito Halo.. Nice Idea.. You May Be Able To Replace The Charater Kayaba And Make a Company To Produce a Possible {Nerve Gear} System.. Then Make SOA…. You Have Quite a Dream.. I think that instead of actually dying in the game, the character that you created should be forever gone. So you don’t die but your character does and you can’t get them back. does anyone know how to play this game on pc i can’t find it i want to play to waste my time untill the new season come out pls tell me and make this season faster pls how can i download this game in PC when will the game be coming out because i just came across this and you dont understand something… I WANT THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I”m in school to make videos games, i will make this game if i ever get the chance. Hey Kirito Halo, nice speech you have there. :p thanks I CRI ERRITIM this is real crap.  this game is on the website but its not even fully created yet. i bet these people are just getting our hearts up just to find out that its just another piece of junk in your life. this game probably isn’t as good as the anime. is there a non-mmo version of this game or something? The links are just sending me to YouTube It really would be nice if some one actually created this game, and properly.. Must be compatible with the Oculous Rift headset and maybe the Pereguin(SP) gaming glove. =D That would be neeeeeeat! Though I did read something in Otaku Magazine a while back, stating that production was in the works for an American release of an SAO MMO… So… who knows? Much Rick. Such Roll. On the “play now” and “official site” buttons xD -_-||| this is so heart breaking Imagine how cool it would be if they’d make this for oculus… By the way, is this a mean joke or why can’t i find any information about this on Aeria Games’ website? FKING RICK ROLL What’s with the youtube link at the bottom right? Damnit I got rickrolled D: um… it’s SAO when i go to play the game, it opens as a music video. Can ny1 help me? this is the most cruel joke in all my life is this game in dvelpment or something?? whoever the hell invented this rick roll…… 1) I hate you with a passion 2) You also deserve an award If this game doesn’t come out soon I think I’m going to explode……literally. I WOULD take the risk to die just for playing SAO with a nervegear. JUST DONT CARE IF I DIE!! ITS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! same here write me back if they do im partering up with u Hey kirito halo it may be to late for you I’ve got a prototype in development right now. Just doing some adjustments and it should be public in about a year. Is this a trap? is there an x-box360 sword art online? dose anybody know? this is the story for people who dont know it. Sword Art Online (SAO) is a Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (VRMMORPG), released in 2022. With the Nerve Gear, a virtual reality helmet that stimulates the user’s five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. On November 6, 2022, the players log into SAO for the first time, and later discover that they are unable to log out. They are then informed by Akihiko Kayaba, SAO’s creator, that if they wish to be free, they must reach the 100th floor of the game’s tower and defeat the final boss. However, if their avatars die in-game, their bodies will also die in the real world. One of these players is Kazuto “Kirito” Kirigaya, who was chosen as one of the 1,000 beta testers in the closed beta. Since he had previous experience and knowledge of the game, he felt that he could beat the game easily. As a result, he set out to beat the game on his own. As the game progresses for two years, Kirito eventually befriends a female player named Asuna with whom he ultimately falls in love. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba’s avatar in SAO, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game. Upon being sent back to the real world, Kirito learns that Asuna and 300 other SAO players have still not awakened yet. Following a clue about Asuna’s whereabouts in another VRMMORPG called Alfheim Online (ALO), Kirito also enters the ALO’s mainframe. Helped by his sister Suguha Kirigaya, known as Leafa in the game, he learns that the trapped players in ALO are part of a plan conceived by Nobuyuki Sugō to perform illegal experiments on their minds to put them under his control, including Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world in order to take over her family’s company. After Kirito foils Nobuyuki’s plans, he finally reunites with Asuna back in the real world. Soon after, Kirito plays another game called Gun Gale Online (GGO) to investigate the mysterious connection between it and deaths occurring in the real world. Assisted by a female player he meets in the game called Sinon, he identifies and exposes the culprits, who include some former members of a murderous guild he had previously encountered in SAO. Kirito is later recruited to assist in testing a state-of-the-art FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface that is far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played. He tests the STL by entering a Virtual Reality world created with The Seed package, named UnderWorld (UW). In the UW mainframe, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito’s memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, he ends up falling into a trap set by one of the murderers from GGO and wakes up inside UnderWorld without any recollection of how he ended up there, unable to log out, with his real self left in a comatose state. little late here just started watching watched it all in one night can’t stop I normally play xbox all day but I can’t stop watching this show it’s insane I would like to participate in your company’s research lol I stay up all night watching all 25 episodes every night You’re like 1 year late :p this is now a game?

Like, use the Oculus Rift and, instead of using a controller to walk, attack and do other actions, use sensor gloves or something. Or, just a helmet, like the Oculus Rift, that connects to your brain somehow. Ok, think of the Mind Flex game, you use your mind to move the ball, well, the fan….but still, you have to think about the ball going up or down for it to move. Take the thought sensors of the Mind Flex headband, you may need to upgrade them in some scientific way, (I wouldn`t know how to do any of this stuff) the Oculus Rift headset, a mic, like an Xbox One mic or PS3 mic, put them all together, and you have the NerveGear headset from Sword Art Online. Don’t TEASE me Bro!! sao game should be like the show it would be interesting and fun and a good rule playing game to others if i was to make it i think i would make it just like kayaba did to were you die in the game you die in real life why when i try to go to the official site does it take me to rick astleys damn youtube page whoever put the rickroll in for the site is a douche and needs their fingers cut off. that shit died and should stay dead.

I would just have my real body all healthy so then I can play forever and If I need to leave, my body is good. Just go play Age of Wushu, that’s a great game and has swords, duel swords, and multiple other things, also it’s free. I really wanna live in this world… someone put me in sword art online!!!!!!!!!!!! aword art online is the best anime ever, still a better romance story than twighlight, and I would die for a life like that. the first person who figures out how to put me in sword art online wins  $20,000,000  (yen, japan money..) my little sister told me about this… and now im addicted…… thank you Dixie……..

As I enter the game please help me!!!! How do i Play This well there is Nothing in this Website me like this is the best anime ever just so you know this stuff above the comments is fake and i have proof the one of asuna is a screan shot of the sao event on mabinogi and the video is from the play station vita game called sword art online hallow fragment. the first item is obvious as they even state it. as for an actual mmo of sao there is none open to the public as of yet. however there is an mmo in production in Korea i believe and it contains a huge portion of the gaming theory of sao. while it does not actually use anything like virtual reality seeing as there is no such known tech available there is none for running the game however they will be adding a fully functional system for the oculous rift. i got abit ahead of my self seeing as i didnt even say its name and i regret to admit that im actualy unsure of the name as things are. but as for the mmo it is in production under closed beta and it will be based on the later in the show alfheim online. i will not go into that as to not spoil it for you fans out there. as for sao games there are multipul betwene the psp and psv although hallow fragment supports multiplayer it as far as i know none of the games have actual mmo features. anyway i hope this clears a few things up for you sao fans and to you haters out there before you open ur mouths ima say screw you first ^_^. peace i’m out! rickrolled… this is stupid I really wanted to play waaaaaaaa Sao will be coming out for the ps3 in april 2015 but is English subbed make more episodes to sword art online its really good I watched all of  them is this a god damn rick roll? the new player have ARRIVED !!!! my name is ajaya gurung this is a troll Really what the hell, .-. *sniffle sniffle* this is cruel, Damn you rick, playing with my feelings like this They need to make a game online elderly not that you can play SAO I have reached every resorts I can for an hour and nothing!!! i adore this anime. lol this way funny.. but seriously. i would be very excited if a real version came out.. of course. without the whole get killed in the game you die in RL.. If they did a MMORPG console/computer game and based it off the ideas of the show, that would be awesome. Almost like a (GOOD) online skyrim type of game. how i can play this game n consigo jogar ‘-’…clico em jogar agora e vai pra uma musica no youtube -.- Great information about the game before I buy it. How can i can a sao game psp i got so furious when I saw it was a troll, the first though my mind had was, “they all must die.” Hey guys this ant a prank it’s just in development when is this game gonna come out i want it so much and how are you a real sao fan if u can’t even spell sao right man this game is allready out with english patches for the computer version and a pretty good patch for the psp newer version or something like that it is called Sword Art Online : Hollow Fragment check it out its a great game and dont be a dick about it. Well Rick Rolled Users Club, is open. LOL OMG!!! I wish Sao was a real game. I’d spend as much money as I could on the game. I’d play it non stop. I’d sell my xbox just to play. If Sao became I real game, I’d probably cry. Bitches..

What technology is needed to create one ? But if they make a game I hope they don’t use Kirito as a character… Only the classes that they were.. Okey they are using them… That’s boring. Woul you rather play as your self in that game or as Kirito? …gg trolls, gg that is suck bull… leads to youtube such* Romurs of companys looking in to the full dive system ment to be around in 15years at moment we need to play the game plsss What got me to realise is it say platform nerve gear how can i play this? i want to play this game!!!

Kayaba was a fool and should have had his mental stability checked before the making and or release of the game. Oh and I already have a book full of Ideas for the game, different races, AND history of the game so be prepared for the most epic VR game EVER and I’ve already thought of two other games to make for the system so chio ^_^ imma get back to studying. Not knocking anyone I promise I’m sure you didn’t mean to spell it wrong. I am already in the process of making a VR game like this and would like to know. I have books full of ideas like the history of the game, new races, even languages for the races I have looked over every detail and fasit<SP? of this game from weapons to Maps and even different enemies now I need a different persons opinion would it be better in anime graphics or realistic as possible graphics? I am already in the process of making a game like this I have books full of ideas from the history of the game to every last bit of the maps and cities. I would like another persons opinion on whether or not it should be realistic or like Anime. "

Tales of Middle Earth,
Lost Labyrinth,"Language: The first thing you need to do after creating your character is to equip your armour (if you have any) and weapon. Make sure you don't drop them by mistake; it's very easy to do that, unfortunately, and there's no way of retrieving items once you have dropped them. The second thing is to lit your light source (usually a torch). Yes, that's right, 'lit' it. The game sometimes lapses into a form of newspeak: to extinguish your lamp, you need to 'unlit' it again. The reason for this is of course that the game wasn't originally written in English: Frank Malota, the game's creator, is German. But you get used to seeing rats 'calling in reinforcements' rather quickly, actually. Graphics and Music: "
Don't Starve,"In particular, McCutcheon revealed the studio's plans for the game going forward, explaining how they intend to release more content, preset worlds, and even more story. He told us: 'We'll keep developing for another six months, release some new features and new content, and in that time we want to develop the characters a little bit more, and probably a few presets for the world generation so we can give people more options for that kind of thing. Maybe give them a little more story, it just depends what happens.' 'We tried to do this as kind of an experiment, we wanted to try something new, try a new business model, and see what we could learn from that. And as each part of the experiment progressed we decided 'we need to take this a little bit further'. It started on Google Chrome, and when we moved from Google Chrome to Steam it got even better for us and so we thought: 'OK, we'll keep going'. It's one of the most awesome experiences I've ever had making a game... every week we look through the forum, and it's really fun to talk to everybody and get the feedback on the things they like and the things they don't like.' He then went on to explain the pros and cons of independent development: 'You can't take as many risks when you're working for a publisher, because they can say 'no'. And they can say 'no' about things that you absolutely, truly think are the right thing for the game. I think in the case where you don't have a publisher it's your risk, it's your dime, it's your time.' 'You're putting your arse on the line and if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. But on the other hand you can take a risk on something that could turn out to be truly great.' "

Angband,"[i] [ii] [iii] In conclusion, it is but fair for me to thank, as  strongly as weak words will permit, those gentlemen  who have in various ways assisted me. To two of  them, who are well known in the world of literature,  and who have not only aided me with advice, but have  placed many new words and etymologies at my service,  I am under particular obligation. With this I beg to  subscribe myself, the readerâs most obedient servant, The Editor. The Publishers will be much obliged by the receipt of any cant, slang, or  vulgar words not mentioned in the Dictionary. The probable origin, or  etymology, of any fashionable or unfashionable vulgarism, will also be  received with thanks. [x] [1] [In those instances indicated by a (*), it is doubtful whether we are  indebted to the Gipsies for the terms. Dad, in Welsh, also signifies a  father. Cur is stated to be a mere term of reproach, like Dog, which  in all European languages has been applied in an abusive sense. Objections  may also be raised against Gad, Maund, and many other of these  parallels. We have, however, no wish to present them as infallible; our  idea is merely to call the readerâs attention to the undoubted similarity  between both the sound and the sense in most examples.] [21] The Celtic languages have contributed many Cant and  vulgar words to our popular vocabulary. These have come to  us through the Gaelic and Irish languages, so closely allied in  their material as to be merely dialects of a primitive common  tongue. This element may arise from the Celtic portion of our  population, which, from its position as slaves or servants to its  ancient conquerors, has contributed so largely to the lowest  class of the community, therefore to our Slang, provincial,  or colloquial words; or it may be an importation from Irish  immigrants, who have contributed their fair proportion to our  criminal stock. There is one source, however, of secret street terms which in  the first edition of this work was entirely overlooked,—indeed,  it was unknown to the original compiler until pointed out by a  correspondent,—the Lingua Franca, or bastard Italian, spoken  at Genoa, Trieste, Malta, Constantinople, Smyrna, Alexandria,  and all Mediterranean seaport towns. The ingredients of this  imported Cant are, as its name denotes, many. Its foundation  is Italian, with a mixture of modern Greek, German (from the  Austrian ports), Spanish, Turkish, and French. It has been  introduced to the notice of the London wandering tribes by the  sailors, foreign and English, who trade to and from the Mediterranean  seaports, but it must not be confounded with the  mixture of Irish, English, and Italian spoken in neighbourhoods  like Saffron Hill and Leather Lane, which are thronged with  swarms of organ-grinders from all parts of Italy, and makers of  images from Rome and Florence,—all of whom, in these dense  thoroughfares, mingle with our lower orders. It would occupy  too much space here to give a list of the words used in either  of these Babel-like tongues, especially as the principal of them  are noted in the dictionary. [27] [34] [38] [40] [71] [73] [74] [75] [138] The costermongers of London number between thirty  and forty thousand. Like other low tribes, they boast a  language, or secret tongue, by which they hide their designs,  movements, and other private affairs. This costersâ speech  offers no new fact, or approach to a fact, for philologists; it is  not very remarkable for originality of construction, neither is it  spiced with low humour, as other cant. But the costermongers  boast that it is known only to themselves; that it is far beyond  the Irish, and puzzles the Jews. This is, however, but a poor  fiction; for, as will be seen, the slang current among them is  of the crudest conception, and only difficult to the most ignorant.  Any one of the smallest pretensions to ability could  learn back slang—could, in fact, create it for himself—as far as  the costersâ vocabulary extends, in a couple of hours. Since  the early editions of this work were published back slang has  become very common; and is now mostly spoken, mixed however,  with various other kinds of slang, in the public markets—the  new dead-meat market being, perhaps, strongest in the way  of pure—if the term may be used—back slang. Perhaps on no subject is the costermonger so silent as on  his money affairs. All costs and profits, he thinks, should be  kept profoundly secret. The back slang, therefore, gives the  various small amounts very minutely, but, as has been before  remarked, these words are known wherever common folk most  do congregate, and are peculiar only for their variations from  the original in the way of pronunciation:— Further than which the costermonger seldom goes in money  reckoning. [353] [354] [355] [356] From these examples the apt student may fairly judge how to form his  own back slang to his own liking and that of his friends. [358] There exists in London a singular tribe of men, known  amongst the âfraternity of vagabondsâ as chaunters and  patterers. Both classes are great talkers. The first sing or  chaunt through the public thoroughfares ballads—political and  humorous—carols, dying speeches, and the various other kinds  of gallows and street literature. The second deliver street  orations on grease-removing compounds, plating powders, high-polishing  blacking, and the thousand-and-one wonderful penny-worths  that are retailed to gaping mobs from a London kerb-stone. Such is a rough description of the men who speak this jargon;  and simple and ridiculous as the vulgar scheme of a rhyming  slang may appear, it must always be regarded as a curious fact  in linguistic history. In order that the readerâs patience may  not be too much taxed, only a selection of rhyming words has  been given in the Glossary,—and these for the most part, as in  the case of the back slang, are the terms of every-day life, as  used by this order of tramps and hucksters. The numerous allusions in the Glossary to well-known places  in London show that this rude speech was mainly concocted in  the metropolis. The police have made themselves partially  acquainted with the back slang, but they are still profoundly  ignorant of the rhyming slang. [366] [367] [368] [369] [371] [373] [375] [376] [378] [379] [380] A copy of this work is in the collection formed by Prince Lucien Bonaparte. THE SLANG DICTIONARY: Etymological, Historical,  and Anecdotal. Crown 8vo, cloth, 6s 6d. A CADGERâS MAP OF A BEGGING DISTRICT. A NEW IMPRESSION âTHE WEDGEâ AND THE âWOODEN SPOON.â [16] [17] [18] [19] A singular feature, however, in vulgar language is the retention  and the revival of sterling old English words, long since  laid up in ancient manuscripts. Disraeli somewhere says, âThe  purest source of neology is in the revival of old wordsâ— Should there be no map, in most lodging-houses there is an  old man who is guide to every âwalkâ in the vicinity, and  who can tell on every round each house that is âgood for a  cold tatur.â The hieroglyphs that are used are:— âGipsies follow their brethren by numerous marks, such as strewing  handfuls of grass in the daytime at a four lane or cross roads; the grass  being strewn down the road the gang have taken; also, by a cross being  made on the ground with a stick or knife—the longest end of the cross  denotes the route taken. In the night-time a cleft stick is placed in the  fence at the cross roads, with an arm pointing down the road their comrades  have taken. The marks are always placed on the left-hand side, so that  the stragglers can easily and readily find them.â âmust be allowed to be an exception, its Greek derivation being universally  admitted, corresponding so exactly as it does in its rectangular form  and compactness to the perfection of manhood, according to the views of  Plato and Simonides; but any deviation from the simple expression, in  which locality is indicated—as, for instance, âa genuine Bathâ—decidedly  breathes the Oriental spirit.â It seems almost obvious that the term must have been applied, not to  dollars certainly, but to money, long before the time of Irving. [76] [77] [79] [81] [82] [86] [88] [89] [91] [94] [96] [97] Modern card-players of a certain kind have considerably improved on  this. [98] [99] [100] [101] [104] [105] â A list of slang terms descriptive of the various patterns of  handkerchiefs, pocket and neck, is here subjoined:— Blackguard as an adjective is very powerful. âTake a pack of cards and open them, then take out all the honours ... and cut  a little from the edges of the rest all alike, so as to make the honours broader  than the rest, so that when your adversary cuts to you, you are certain of an  honour. When you cut to your adversary cut at the ends, and then it is a  chance if you cut him an honour, because the cards at the ends are all of a  length. Thus you may make breefs end-ways as well as sideways.â [109] [111] [112] [115] [117] [118] [119] [124] [125] [127] [128] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] Îá½ ÏÎ±Î½Ïá½¸Ï á¼Î½Î´Ïá½¸Ï Îµá¼°Ï Îá½¹ÏÎ¹Î½Î¸Î¿Î½ á¼ÏÎ¸á¾¿ á½ ÏÎ»Î¿á¿¦Ï; âNon cuivis hommi contingit adire Corinthum,â Cupboard is the fount-spring of the love supposed to exist among  policemen for the cooks upon their beats. [139] [142] [143] [146] [148] [149] [151] [152] [155] The term is now almost general for all cranes used in loading ships, or  doing similar work of a heavy nature.

See one of  Lord Baconâs aphorisms, beginning âA cursed page.â ââSfoot, what a witty rogue was this to leave this fair thirteenpence halfpenny, and  this old halter,â intimating aptly— Though often confounded with, they are utterly dissimilar to, the  modern High Church or Anglo-Catholic party, who now receive the  title at times; while their opponents receive the corresponding appellation  of âLow and Slow,â and the so-called âBroad Churchâ is  defined with equal felicity as the âBroad and Shallow.â Humourists  have divided these three portions of one Church into Attitudinarians,  Platitudinarians, and Latitudinarians. De Quincey thus discourses upon the word:— The use of this term is almost universal; in California there is a town  called Humbug Flat—a name which gives a significant hint of the  acuteness of the first settler.

It  has since become fashionable at the Universities. [303] Common in America, and much used in some parts of Scotland. [307] âIn a box of the stone-jug I was born.â The origin of the phrase being lost sight of, like that of many others,  it is often used as a modification of âStrike me blind!â and is now and  again corrupted into âStrike me silly!â A foolish variation of this is  âStrike me up a gum-tree!â [320] [321] [322] [323] [324] [325] [327] [330] [331] [332] There are, however, whatever non-racing men may think, many âtoutsâ  whose information is valuable to even the âbest informedâ writers. [334] It is almost needless to remark that the poet had no intention of using  the word in any but its widest and most general sense.

A sixpenny pamphlet, with a coloured frontispiece representing a beggarâs  carnival. Contains a great number of Cant words and phrases. A vulgar performance, consisting of pilferings from Grose, and made up with  meanings of a degraded character. It is a curious fact connected with slang that a great number of vulgar words  common in England are equally common in the United States; and when  we remember that America began to be peopled two centuries ago, and that  these colloquialisms must have crossed the sea with the first emigrants, we  can form some idea of the antiquity of popular or street language. Many  words, owing to the caprices of fashion or society, have wholly disappeared  in the parent country, whilst in the colonies they are yet heard. The  words âskink,â to serve drink in company, and the old term âmichingâ or  âmeeching,â skulking or playing truant, for instance, are still in use in the  United States, although nearly obsolete here.

Watt says this is the first book which professes to give an account of the  Canting language of thieves and vagabonds. But this is wrong, as will have  been seen from the remarks on Harman, who collected the words of the  vagabond crew half a century before. âThis work affords a greater insight into the fashionable follies and vulgar  habits of Queen Elizabethâs day than perhaps any other extant.â âWith canting songs never before printed.â A silly and childish performance, full of blunders and contradictions.
